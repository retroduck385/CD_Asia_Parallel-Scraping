San Antonio, Pasig City\n\nAttention: AAA\n\n_______________\n\nBBB\n\n_______________\n\nGentlemen :\n\nThis refers to your request for confirmation of your opinion that Peso Redee Financing Co., Inc. (\"PRFCI\") is exempt from the payment of income tax, withholding tax, and value-added tax (VAT) for services rendered abroad by Tyrads Pte. Ltd., a non-resident foreign corporation (\"NRFC\").\n\nIt is represented that PRFCI is a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the Republic of the Philippines offering financial services such as loans which are provided through web and mobile applications.\n\nOn the other hand, Tyrads Pte. Ltd. is a NRFC registered under the laws of Singapore; that it is not registered as a corporation, partnership or one-person corporation in the Philippines per Certificate of Non-Registration of Company issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 18, 2023; and that it is engaged in the business of advertising services.\n\nOn January 3, 2023, the above-mentioned Corporations entered into a Lead Generation Agreement wherein Tyrads Pte. Ltd. shall render advertising services for a fee or remuneration to PRFCI. Tyrads Pte. Ltd. shall engage Webmasters to place PRFCI's advertisements on the internet to attract customers. Thereafter, Tyrads Pte. Ltd. shall provide results by providing a statistical data according to the conditions set forth in the placement of the advertisements. PRFCI will pay Tyrads Pte. Ltd. all incurred charges and fees based on the statistical data provided by the latter. Said services were performed in Tyrads Pte. Ltd.'s place of business in Singapore.\n\nIn this regard, you would like to have confirmation of your opinion that the payment of service fees by PRFCI to Tyrads Pte. Ltd. to Silvercase Pacific is not subject to income tax, withholding tax, and VAT.\n\nIn reply, please be informed that Section 23 (F) of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997 (Tax Code), as amended, states that a foreign corporation, whether engaged or not in trade or business in the Philippines, is taxable only on income derived from sources within the Philippines. Meanwhile, income under Section 42 (A) (3) of the Tax Code, as amended, is considered derived in the Philippines only if the services are actually performed in the Philippines.\n\nThe rule in this jurisdiction regarding tax situs is that the source of income is the property, activity or service that produced the income, the test of taxability is the \"source\" and the source of income is that activity which produced that income. [1] In ascertaining the income source, we must inquire into the property, activity or service that produced the income, or where the inflow of wealth originated. [2]\n\nIn Aces Philippines Cellular Satellite Corporation vs. the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, [3] the Supreme Court discussed that in determining the income generating activity of a NRFC, the services provided in the service agreement must be examined in its entirety or as a whole, and not to single out or compartmentalize one particular activity, thus:\n\n\"The Court agrees with the CTA that the income-generating activity takes place not during the act of transmission but only upon the gateway's receipt of the call as routed by the satellite. As will be discussed below, the Court identifies the gateway's receipt of the call as the income source as it coincides with (1) the completion or delivery of the service, and (2) the inflow of economic benefits in favor of Aces Bermuda.\n\n1) The gateway receipt of the\nrouted call marks\nthe completion or delivery of\nthe service\n\nIn rejecting Aces Philippines' attempt to single out the act of transmission as the income-producing activity, the Court echoes the CTA En Banc's keen observation that \"there is a continuous and very real connection\" within the components of the Aces System. While the satellite appears to be the focal point of the system, the Court cannot ignore that there is a two-/three-way inter-connection or inter-dependence between/among the satellite in outer space, the control center in Indonesia, and the terminals and gateways on the Philippines.\n\nBy itself, the act of transmission only suggests that a Philippine subscriber has made a call and that the satellite received the call and signaled the control center to determine where the call should be routed. At this point, the satellite and its control center have only determined the location the call shall be directed to but not have actually routed the call. Thus, it is clear that nothing has been sold/delivered yet to Aces Philippines. At best, Aces Bermuda's provision of its service remains in-progress at this stage and requires further action to be completed.\n\nThat Aces Bermuda's service: (a) relies on the inter-connectivity of the Aces Satellite System's components, and (b) cannot be compartmentalized to the point of transmission are inherent in the nature of its principal undertaking.\n\nThe CTA En Banc emphasized that Aces Bermuda undertook to provide satellite communication time to petitioner Aces Philippines. As expressly described in the Air Time Purchase Agreement, Aces Bermuda's provision of satellite communication services relies on the entire Aces System consisting of a satellite that is interconnected with terminals and gateways. The technology was designed precisely to allow local service providers (e.g., Aces Philippines) to access, connect to, and use the Aces Satellite System so that, in turn, the local service providers can cater to their local subscribers (e.g., Philippine subscribers) whose calls require the use of/access to the Aces Satellite System to be able to contact and be connected to another mobile/landline number.\n\nThus, the fulfillment of Aces Bermuda's undertaking requires the satellite to have transmitted/routed the call (first segment) and a gateway to have received the call as routed by the satellite (second segment). At the point of transmission, Aces Philippines has not been given access to the Aces System yet. It is only when the call is actually routed to its gateway that Aces Philippines is able to connect its local subscriber to the intended recipient of the call. In this sense, the gateway's receipt of the call signifies completion/delivery of Aces Bermuda's service.\n\n2) The accrual of satellite air\ntime fees marks the inflow of\neconomic benefits\n\nA reading of Section 3.2 of the Air Time Purchase Agreement supra, reveals that Aces Bermuda charges satellite air time fees to Aces Philippines according to the latter's usage. Its usage is determined by allocation (Billable Units) based on all calls made to or from Aces Philippines' subscribers utilizing the Aces System \u2014 routed through the satellite \u2014 regardless of the location of the subscriber at the time of the call or the gateway handling the call. Certainly, Aces Philippines will not be charged anything at the point of transmission inasmuch as there has not been any usage at the time and satellite air time fees expressly exclude satellite utilization time for call set-up, unanswered calls and incomplete calls.\n\nIn other words, the satellite air time fees accrue only when the satellite air time is delivered to Aces Philippines (i.e., upon the gateway's receipt of the routed call) and is utilized by the Philippine subscriber for a voice or date call. The accrual of fees payable to Aces Bermuda signifies the inflow of economic benefits.\" (Citations omitted; Underscoring ours)\n\nIn this case, the Lead-Generation Agreement expressly states that PRFCI will pay Tyrads Pte. Ltd. all incurred charges and fees based on the statistical data. 'Statistical data' refers to a detailed report on the customer's lead performance, specifying information on the amount of provided services. The term 'lead' on the other hand, refers to a measurable result (e.g., a purchase, an order, download, etc.) of display of the ads that is achieved by a user completing the necessary action on the customer's website. Based on the said definition, it can be inferred that the statistical data will contain information on how many users availed the services of PRFCI due to the advertisements provided in the different websites. Thus, the provision of the statistical data by Tyrads Pte. Ltd. signifies the inflow of economic benefits which is its income-generating activity.\n\nAfter having identified the source of income, we now inquire into its situs. It is settled that where the inflow of wealth and/or economic benefits proceeds from, and occurs within Philippine territory, it enjoys protection of the Philippine government. In consideration of such protection, the flow of wealth should share the burden of supporting the government, and thus, is subject to tax. [4]\n\nIn the Aces Case, the Supreme Court explained how to determine the situs of services performed by a NRFC, to wit:\n\n\"1) The income-generating activity is directly associated with the gateways located within Philippine territory.\n\nVerily, Aces Philippines admits that the gateway's receipt of the call as routed by the satellite (i.e., second segment of Aces System) takes place in the Philippines. However, it insists that any income arising therefrom cannot be attributable to Aces Bermuda because: (a) Aces Bermuda's operations are confined to its satellite in outer space; and (b) Aces Philippines, not Aces Bermuda, owns the gateways and related equipment installed in the Philippines.\n\nThese contentions do not persuade.\n\nFirst, the Court has already discussed above that Aces Bermuda's service encompasses both first and second segments of the Aces System's operations. The performance of the service does not cease at the point of transmission but continues until such time Aces Bermuda delivers the satellite communication time (i.e., routes the call) to the Philippine gateway.\n\nSecond, while Aces Philippines is the legal owner/operator of the Philippine gateways, it cannot be denied that these gateways were constructed primarily to serve the needs and requirements of the Aces System.\n\nTo recall, under the Gateway Agreement executed between PLDT and Aces Indonesia in 1995, Aces Indonesia had supplied PLDT with the necessary equipment and software to enable the latter to \"construct, own and operate a [g]ateway or [g]ateways in the Philippines. The construction of the gateways was an act preparatory to the Air Time Purchase Agreement executed in 1997.\n\nIt was instrumental in and necessary to providing and installing the required technology in the Philippines precisely to join PLDT/Aces Philippines to the Aces Satellite System.\n\nThe agreements, taken together, were instrumental in allowing Aces Bermuda to make its services available to the Philippine subscribers. The nature of its undertaking necessitates Aces Bermuda to contract service providers in specific jurisdictions like the Philippines. Even if Aces Bermuda operates the satellite in outer space, it cannot provide its services completely even if a territory is within its coverage. It needs: (a) to cause the construction of terrestrial gateways that will receive signals from its satellite; (b) to provide the specific equipment and software to ensure that the gateways are compatible with the Aces System; and (c) to contract a local supplier (e.g., PLDT/Aces Philippines) that would operate the gateways and act as its local distributor of services.\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\nTo stress, the income-generating activity (i.e., accrual of satellite airtime fee payments and completion of the principal undertaking) coincides with the receipt of the routed call by gateways located within Philippine territory. That income generation is dependent on the operations of facilities situated in the Philippines contributes to the income's Philippine situs. Verily, the gateways are legally owned by Aces Philippines. Nonetheless, Aces Bermuda has sufficient economic/beneficial interest in these Philippine properties, inasmuch as its Philippine operations are dependent on those local facilities.\" (Underscoring supplied)\n\nAs previously mentioned, the Lead Generation Agreement states that income payments to Tyrads Pte. Ltd. shall be based on the statistical data. It is the understanding of this Office that the statistical data can only be generated once customers or users from the internet avail the services of PRFCI because of the advertisements provided by Tyrads Pte. Ltd. Depending on the number of customers or users thereof, it will determine the amount payable to Tyrads Pte. Ltd. Upon careful reading of the Lead Generation Agreement, the posting of the advertisements online and availment of the services advertised allowed Tyrads Pte. Ltd. to perform its services within the Philippine territory.\n\nBased on the foregoing discussions, since the services are considered performed within the Philippines, income payments to Tyrads Pte. Ltd. shall be subject to income tax and, consequently, to withholding tax.\n\nWith respect to VAT, Section 108 (A) of the Tax Code, as amended, provides that payments for the sale or exchange of services, including the use or lease of properties are subject to the twelve percent (12%) VAT only if the services are performed in the Philippines. The phrase 'sale or exchange of services' means the performance of all kinds of services in the Philippines for others for a fee, remuneration or consideration. Thus, considering the above discussions, income payments made by PRFCI for the services performed by Tyrads Pte. Ltd. shall be subject to VAT.\n\nSettled is the rule that exemptions from tax are strictly construed against the taxpayer and liberally construed in favor of the taxing authority. One who claims tax exemption must point to a specific provision of law conferring, in clear and plain terms, exemption from the common burden and prove, through substantial evidence, that it is, in fact, covered by the exemption so claimed. [5]\n\nIn connection therewith, the rule is that the taxpayer bears the burden of proving that the \"income was from sources outside the Philippines and exempt from the application of our income tax law.\" [6] In light of this context, it is the opinion of this Office that PRFCI failed to prove that the income of Tyrads Pte. Ltd. was from sources outside the Philippines.\n\nThis ruling is issued on the basis of the facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it shall be disclosed that the actual facts are different, then this ruling shall be without force and effect insofar as the herein parties are concerned.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.)

Fininity OU is not registered as a corporation, partnership or one-person corporation.\n\nThe above-mentioned Corporations entered into an Advertising Agreement dated June 20, 2022 wherein Fininity OU shall render advertising services to OPC for a fee. Under the said Agreement, a person (i.e., consumer) who clicks on an advertisement (on websites, emails or SMS) showcasing the consumer services offered by OLP in the Philippines, Fininity OU will direct them to OLP's website. The advertisement services stated in the Agreement were performed in the principal place of business of Fininity OU which is in Tallinn, Estonia. [2]\n\nUnder the payment terms of the Agreement, OLP shall pay Fininity OU a fee of 1.6 USD per application submitted by a person at OLP's website after clicking Fininity OU's link.\n\nIn this regard, you would like to confirm your opinion that the payment of service fees of OLP to Fininity OU is not subject to income tax and value-added tax (VAT), and consequently to withholding tax.\n\nIn reply, please be informed that Section 23 (F) of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997 (Tax Code), as amended, states that a foreign corporation, whether engaged or not in trade or business in the Philippines, is taxable only on income derived from sources within the Philippines. Concerning income from the provision of service, under Section 42 (A) (3) of the Tax Code, as amended, this is considered derived in the Philippines only if the services are actually performed in the Philippines.\n\nWith respect to value-added tax (VAT), Section 108 (A) of the Tax Code, as amended, provides that payments for the sale or exchange of services, including the use or lease of properties are subject to the twelve percent (12%) VAT only if the services are performed in the Philippines. The phrase 'sale or exchange of services' means the performance of all kinds of services in the Philippines for others for a fee, remuneration or consideration.\n\nThe rule in this jurisdiction regarding tax situs is that the source of income is the property, activity or service that produced the income, the test of taxability is the \"source\" and the source of income is that activity which produced the income. [3] In ascertaining the income source, we must inquire into the property, activity or service that produced the income, or where the inflow of wealth originated. [4]\n\nIn Aces Philippines Cellular Satellite Corporation vs. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue, [5] the Supreme Court discussed that in determining the income generating activity of a NRFC, the services provided in the service agreement must be examined in its entirety or as a whole, and not to single out or compartmentalize one particular activity, thus:\n\nThe Court agrees with the CTA that the income-generating activity takes place not during the act of transmission but only upon the gateway's receipt of the call as routed by the satellite. As will be discussed below, the Court identifies the gateway's receipt of the call as the income source as it coincides with (1) the completion or delivery of the service, and (2) the inflow of economic benefits in favor of Aces Bermuda.\n\n1) The gateway's receipt of the\nrouted call marks the\ncompletion or delivery of the\nservice.\n\nIn rejecting Aces Philippines' attempt to single out the act of transmission as the income-producing activity, the Court echoes the CTA En Banc's keen observation that \"there is a continuous and very real connection\" within the components of the Aces System. While the satellite appears to be the focal point of the system, the Court cannot ignore that there is a two-/three-way inter-connection or inter-dependence between/among the satellite in outer space, the control center in Indonesia, and the terminals and gateways in the Philippines.\n\nBy itself, the act of transmission only suggests that a Philippine subscriber has made a call and that the satellite received the call and signaled the control center to determine where the call should be routed. At this point, the satellite and its control center have only determined the location the call shall be directed to but have not actually routed the call. Thus, it is clear that nothing has been sold/delivered yet to Aces Philippines. At best, Aces Bermuda's provision of its service remains in-progress at this stage and requires further action to be completed.\n\nThat Aces Bermuda's service: (a) relies on the inter-connectivity of the Aces Satellite System's components, and (b) cannot be compartmentalized to the point of transmission are inherent in the nature of its principal undertaking.\n\nThe CTA En Banc emphasized that Aces Bermuda undertook to provide satellite communication time to petitioner Aces Philippines. As expressly described in the Air Time Purchase Agreement, Aces Bermuda's provision of satellite communication services relies on the entire Aces System consisting of a satellite that is interconnected with terminals and gateways. The technology was designed precisely to allow local service providers (e.g., Aces Philippines) to access, connect to, and use the Aces Satellite System so that, in turn, the local service providers can cater to their local subscribers (e.g., Philippine subscribers) whose calls require the use of/access to the Aces Satellite System to be able to contact and be connected to another mobile/landline number.\n\nThus, the fulfillment of Aces Bermuda's undertaking requires the satellite to have transmitted/routed the call (first segment) and a gateway to have received the call as routed by the satellite (second segment). At the point of transmission, Aces Philippines has not been given access to the Aces System yet. It is only when the call is actually routed to its gateway that Aces Philippines is able to connect its local subscriber to the intended recipient of the call. In this sense, the gateway's receipt of the call signifies completion/delivery of Aces Bermuda's service.\n\n2) The accrual of satellite air\ntime fees marks the inflow of\neconomic benefits.\n\nA reading of Section 3.2 of the Air Time Purchase Agreement, supra, reveals that Aces Bermuda charges satellite air time fees to Aces Philippines according to the latter's usage. Its usage is determined by allocation (Billable Units) based on all calls made to or from Aces Philippine subscribers utilizing the Aces System \u2014 routed through the satellite \u2014 regardless of the location of the subscriber at the time of the call or the gateway handling the call. Certainly, Aces Philippines will not be charged anything at the point of transmission inasmuch as there has not been any usage at that time and satellite air time fees expressly exclude satellite utilization time for call set-up, unanswered calls and incomplete calls.\n\nIn other words, the satellite air time fees accrue only when the satellite air time is delivered to Aces Philippines (i.e., upon the gateway's receipt of the routed call) and is utilized by the Philippine subscriber for a voice or data call. The accrual of fees payable to Aces Bermuda signifies the inflow of economic benefits. (Citations omitted; Underscoring ours)\n\nIn this case, the Advertising Agreement expressly states that OLP shall pay Fininity OU a fee of 1.6 USD per application submitted by a person at OLP's website after clicking Fininity OU's link. Therefore, the income generating activity is upon the availment of a consumer of OLP's services as a result of the advertisement posted by Fininity OU. This activity signifies the inflow of economic benefits of Fininity OU which is its income-generating activity.\n\nAfter having identified the source of income, we now inquire into its situs. It is settled that where the inflow of wealth and/or economic benefits proceeds from, and occurs within Philippine territory, it enjoys protection of the Philippine government. In consideration of such protection, the flow of wealth should share the burden of supporting the government, and thus, is subject to tax. [6]\n\nIn the Aces Case, the Supreme Court explained how to determine the situs of services performed by a NRFC, to wit:\n\n\"1) The income-generating activity is directly associated with the gateways located within Philippine territory.\n\nVerily, Aces Philippines admits that the gateway's receipt of the call as routed by satellite (i.e., second segment of Aces System) takes place in the Philippines. However, it insists that any income arising therefrom cannot be attributable to Aces Bermuda because: (a) Aces Bermuda's operations are confined to its satellite in outer space; and (b) Aces Philippines, not Aces Bermuda, owns the gateways and related equipment installed in the Philippines.\n\nThese contentions do not persuade.\n\nFirst, the Court has already discussed above that Aces Bermuda's service encompasses both first and second segments of the Aces System's operations. The performance of the service does not cease at the point of transmission but continues until such time Aces Bermuda delivers the satellite communication time (i.e., routes the call) to the Philippine gateway.\n\nSecond, while Aces Philippines is the legal owner/operator of the Philippine gateways, it cannot be denied that these gateways were constructed primarily to serve the needs and requirements of the Aces System.\n\nTo recall, under the Gateway Agreement executed between PLDT and Aces Indonesia in 1995, Aces Indonesia had supplied PLDT with the necessary equipment and software to enable the latter \"to construct, own and operate a [g]ateway or [g]ateways in the Philippines. The construction of the gateways was an act preparatory to the Air Time Purchase Agreement executed in 1997. It was instrumental in and necessary to providing and installing the required technology in the Philippines precisely to join PLDT/Aces Philippines to the Aces Satellite System.\n\nThe agreements, taken together, were instrumental in allowing Aces Bermuda to make its services available to Philippine subscribers. The nature of its undertaking necessitates Aces Bermuda to contract service providers in specific jurisdictions like the Philippines. Even if Aces Bermuda operates the satellite in outer space, it cannot provide its services completely even if a territory is within its coverage. It needs: (a) to cause the construction of terrestrial gateways that will receive signals from its satellite; (b) to provide the specific equipment and software to ensure that the gateways are compatible with the Aces System; and (c) to contract a local supplier (e.g., PLDT/Aces Philippines) that would operate the gateways and act as its local distributor of services.\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\nTo stress, the income-generating activity (i.e., accrual of satellite airtime fee payments and completion of the principal undertaking) coincides with the receipt of the routed call by gateways located within Philippine territory. That income generation is dependent on the operations of facilities situated in the Philippines contributes to the income's Philippine situs. Verily, the gateways are legally owned by Aces Philippines. Nonetheless, Aces Bermuda has sufficient economic/beneficial interest in these Philippine properties, inasmuch as its Philippine operations are dependent on these local facilities.\" (Underscoring supplied)\n\nAs previously mentioned, the income-generating activity of Fininity OU is the successful availment of OLP's services by a consumer due the advertisement posted by Fininity OU which displays the consumer offering of OLP in the Philippines. Thus, it can be inferred that the posting of the advertisements online and availment of the services advertised allowed Fininity OU to perform its services within the Philippine territory.\n\nIn sum, the income payments by OLP to Fininity OU constitute income from sources within the Philippines. In view of the foregoing, the income payments to Fininity OU shall be subject to income tax and VAT, and consequently, to withholding tax.\n\nThis ruling is issued on the basis of the facts as represented. However, if upon investigation it shall be disclosed that the actual facts are different, then this ruling shall be without force and effect insofar as the herein parties are concerned.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.)

Ramon Magsaysay\nBago Bantay, Quezon City\n\nAttention: AAA\n\n_______________\n\nGentlemen :\n\nThis refers to your letter requesting exemption from the payment of capital gains tax and other taxes, relative to the transfer of titles of land in favor of fully paid member-beneficiaries pursuant to Republic Act No. 7279, otherwise known as the \"Urban Development and Housing Act of 1992.\"\n\nDocuments show that Kapit-Bisig ng Abra Homeowners Association, Incorporated is a non-stock, non-profit organization duly registered with the Home Insurance and Guaranty Corporation under Registration No. 04-2330. It is the registered owner of parcels of land covered by the following Transfer Certificates of Title (TCT):\n\nTCT No.\n\nLot Area (in sq.m)\n\nN-243431\n\n31 sq.m.\n\nN-243430\n\n31 sq.m.\n\nN-243442\n\n31 sq.m.\n\nissued by the Registry of Deeds of Quezon City acquired through a loan under the Community Mortgage Program of the Social Housing Finance Corporation (SHFC) and with the Quezon City Government as originator. The SHFC issued a Partial Release of Real Estate Mortgage constituted over each of the above-listed properties described in the TCTs.\n\nThe purchased properties are now in the process of being transferred under the names of the following owners/qualified beneficiaries by virtue of their respective Deeds of Absolute Sale:\n\nName of Member-Beneficiaries\n\nTCT No.\n\nBBB\n\nN-243431\n\nCCC\n\nN-243430\n\nDDD\n\nN-243442\n\nIn reply, please be informed that the transfer in favor of your individual member-beneficiaries of the abovementioned subdivided properties is not subject to either the capital gains tax imposed under Section 27 (D) (5) of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended (Tax Code), or the creditable withholding tax imposed under Revenue Regulations No. 2-98, as amended, implementing Section 57 (B) of the same Code, considering that the said transfer is merely a formality to finally effect the transfer of the said properties to your member-beneficiaries who actually bought the same from the former owner through your Association. In other words, the association is in fact transferring the ownership of the properties to its member-beneficiaries, who actually own the same.\n\nFurthermore, the said transfer is not subject to the donor's tax imposed under Section 99 of the Tax Code since there is no donative intent or intention on your part to donate the said properties to each member-beneficiary, considering that you could not donate such properties, the ownership of which belongs to the member-beneficiaries themselves. [1]\n\nIt is noted that under Section 196 of the Tax Code, the deeds or documents subject to the documentary stamp tax (DST) imposed therein are those where the realty sold shall be granted, assigned, transferred, or otherwise conveyed to a purchaser or purchasers or to any other person or persons designated by such purchase or purchasers, thereby excluding from its purview the instant case considering that the supposed purchaser is actually the owner thereof.\n\nAccordingly, the transfer of titles of the said properties in favor of your member-beneficiaries is not subject to the DST imposed under Section 196 of the Tax Code. However, the notarial acknowledgment of the deed of conveyance is subject to DST pursuant to Section 188 of the Tax Code. [2]\n\nIt is, however, understood that this Ruling is never intended and shall not be construed as giving authority to the concerned Register of Deeds to effect transfer of the land titles in the names of the qualified socialized housing member-beneficiaries without the necessary Certificate Authorizing Registration (CAR) issued by the Bureau of Internal Revenue. In this regard, this Ruling shall be presented to the Revenue District Office concerned in order for the latter to issue the CAR after the submission of the complete requirements provided under Revenue Memorandum Order No. 15-2003. [3]\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented.

Cabling\n\nPresident\n\nGentlemen :\n\nThis refers to your request on behalf of LOWER MALANDAY HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION, INC. for exemption from the payment of taxes relative to the transfer of titles of land in favor of its qualified member-beneficiaries pursuant to Republic Act No. 7279, otherwise known as the \"Urban Development and Housing Act of 1992.\"\n\nIt is represented that LOWER MALANDAY HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION, INC., located at 380 Mangga St., Road 3 Paradise, Malanday, Marikina City, is an association registered with the Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board; that the association acquired a portion of a parcel of land or Twenty Two Thousand Two Hundred Eighteen square meters (22,218 sq.m.) from the total area of Twenty Two Thousand Four Hundred Twenty One square meters (22,421 sq.m.) owned by AAA, BBB, CCC, DDD, and EEE under the Community Mortgage Program; that the association is now the registered owner of the above-mentioned parcel of land and is now subdivided and covered by Three Hundred Fifteen (315) Transfer Certificates of Title including Roadlots, Open Space, Alleys and Pathways; and that the association is now in the process of effecting the transfer/individualization of the said subdivided properties to its member-beneficiaries who actually bought the said parcels of land as certified by the Social Housing Finance Corporation in its Certification dated March 3, 2023.\n\nIn reply, please be informed that the transfer of the subdivided lots in favor of the qualified socialized housing member-beneficiaries of LOWER MALANDAY HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION, INC. is not subject to either the capital gains tax imposed under Section 27 (D) (5) of the National Internal Revenue Code (Tax Code) of 1997, as amended, or the creditable withholding tax imposed under Section 57 of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, implemented by Revenue Regulations No. 2-98, as amended, considering that said transfer is only a formality to finally effect the transfer of the subject property to its member-beneficiaries who actually bought the same from the former owner through the Association. In other words, the Association is merely transferring the ownership of the property to its member-beneficiaries who actually own the same. (BIR Ruling No. OT-484-21 dated December 24, 2021)\n\nMoreover, the said transfer is not subject to the donor's tax imposed under Section 99 of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, since there is no donative intent on the part of Association to donate the property to its members-beneficiaries, considering that it could not donate property the ownership of which already belongs to the members-beneficiaries themselves.\n\nFurthermore, under Section 196 of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, the deeds or documents subject to the documentary stamp tax (DST) imposed therein are those where the realty sold are granted, assigned, transferred, donated or otherwise conveyed to a purchaser or purchasers or to any other person or persons designated by such purchaser or purchasers, thereby excluding from its purview the instant case. Accordingly, the transfer of the subdivided lots in favor of the beneficiaries is not subject to DST under Section 196 of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended. However, the notarial acknowledgment to the deed of conveyance is subject to the DST of P30.00 pursuant to Section 188 of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended.\n\nIt is, however, understood that this Ruling is never intended, and shall not be construed, as giving authority to the concerned Register of Deeds to effect transfer of the land titles in the names of the qualified socialized housing member-beneficiaries without the necessary Certificate Authorizing Registration (CAR) issued by the Bureau of Internal Revenue. In this regard, this Ruling shall be presented to the Revenue District Office concerned in order for the latter to issue the CAR after the submission of the complete requirements provided under Revenue Memorandum Order No. 15-2003.\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the forgoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be disclosed that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void.\n\nIssued this 24th day of April, 2025.\n\n(SGD.) ROMEO D. LUMAGUI, JR.\nCommissioner of Internal Revenue",

[2]\n\nIt is apparent that the grounds that you pointed out are based on the regular prescription of three (3) years. [3] In reply, we maintain the position of Revenue District Officer (RDO) Timm Renomeron, through a letter sent to you on April 20, 2022, denying your request for cancellation of eLA. As explained by RDO Renomeron, the cited 3-year prescriptive period is inapplicable, as your P3,472,502.63 under-declared purchases amounting to 71.84% of your total actual purchases of P4,833,499.71 in 2017, is considered substantial and constitutes prima facie evidence of fraud.

There is no uniform date for the reckoning of the prescriptive period for all types of taxes. Considering the different periods for the filing of various tax returns, the reckoning for the counting of the prescription period differs for each type of tax. To be specific, for withholding taxes, the 3-year prescriptive period shall be counted from the date required for the filing of the monthly return; for Value-Added Tax, it shall be the prescribed filing date of the quarterly return; and for income tax, the prescriptive period is counted from the required filing date for the annual income tax return. Hence, the reckoning for the counting of the prescriptive period of the following types of taxes is shown hereunder: x x x.\"\n\n2. \"1.

It is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR). It is primarily engaged in the business of manufacture of food products (i.e., baking of bread, cakes, pastries, pies, and similar perishable bakery products, including hopia and doughnut).\n\nSarimonde is a wholly owned subsidiary of Monde Nissin Corporation (\"Monde Nissin\"). Since its incorporation on June 27, 2016, Sarimonde has consistently adopted the weighted average method in costing its inventory. On the other hand, Monde Nissin adopts FIFO for its inventory valuation.\n\nAs a subsidiary company, Sarimonde is required to periodically report its financial status and operations to its parent company, Monde Nissin. In doing so, Sarimonde has to convert its cost inventory accounting from weighted average method to FIFO method every time it submits financial reports thereto. AIDSTE\n\nIn order to permanently align its method of inventory valuation with Monde Nissin and other affiliates, Sarimonde Board of Directors has decided and approved the change of the Company's inventory costing method from weighted average method to FIFO. Hence, this request.\n\nBelow is a comparison of gross profits between weighted average method and FIFO method for the first three months of 2022 which shows that the use of FIFO in inventory costing would not result in a substantial difference in the total cost of sales and gross profit, and would still clearly reflect the income of the Company.

Valuation of Inventories. \u2014 The law provides two tests to which each inventory must conform. \u2014 (1) it must conform as nearly as possible to the best accounting practice in the trade or business, and (2) it must clearly reflect the income. It follows, therefore, that inventory rules can not be uniform but must give effect to trade customs which come within the scope of the best accounting practice in the particular trade or business. In order to clearly reflect income, the inventory practice of a taxpayer should be consistent from year to year, and greater weight is to be given to consistency than to any particular method of inventory or basis of valuation, as long as the method of basis used is substantially in accord with these regulations, an inventory that can be used under the best accounting practice in a balance sheet showing the financial position of the taxpayer is, as a general rule, regarded as clearly reflecting his income.\"\n\nConsidering that the change in Sarimonde's accounting method is needed to align its inventory costing method with Monde Nissin and other affiliates; thus, relieve itself from the burden of converting its financial report to conform to the accounting practice of Monde Nissin and other affiliates, the Company is hereby granted permission to change its accounting method from weighted average method to FIFO method effective January 1, 2022 pursuant to the provision of Section 41 of the Tax Code, as amended, provided that such method conforms nearly as possible to the best accounting practice in the trade or business, and it will clearly reflect the income of the company. AaCTcI\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be ascertained that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) ROMEO D.

Rosal\nDirector\nTechnology and Management Office\nProductivity and Development Center\n\nGentlemen :\n\nThis refers to your request for the issuance of a ruling that will govern the availment of tax incentives available to donors in connection with the project entitled \"Business Recovery and Resilience: Assistance to Small Enterprises and Critical Sectors\" in cooperation with the Asian Productivity Organization (APO).\n\nIt is represented that the cited project was designed to provide an assistance package to small enterprises and associations of sectors critically affected by the COVID-19 pandemic to enhance their capability in dealing with the challenges of ensuring continued operations and timely delivery of products despite disruptions.\n\nPursuant to the said project, equipment was given to donee-beneficiaries selected based on five (5) criteria and considerations, to wit: (1) They have not directly benefited from mainstream government livelihood programs; (2) Their products are essential; (3) They have temporarily stopped operations due to the pandemic; (4) They have plans for recovery, with specific production targets; and (5) They are looking to diversify products/services to help in business recovery and resilience. As further represented, the equipment was provided through the funding of APO, an intergovernmental organization, and given to donee-beneficiaries (i.e., private enterprises) through the Development Academy of the Philippines (DAP), a government-owned and controlled corporation (GOCC), as the local implementing arm of APO. HTcADC\n\nBased on the said criteria and considerations, the following were chosen as donee-beneficiaries:\n\nName\n\nDTI/SEC Registration Number\n\n1.

Sangkutsa Food Products, Inc.\n\n201600127\n\nIn reply, please be informed as follows:\n\nDonor's Tax\n\nSection 98 in relation to Section 99 of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended, provides that transfer by any person, resident or non-resident, by gift, of property, real or personal, is generally subject to six percent (6%) donor's tax computed on the basis of the total gifts in excess of Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Pesos (P250,000.00) exempt gift made during the calendar year. Sections 98 and 99 read:\n\n\"CHAPTER II\nDONOR'S TAX\n\nSection 98.

The donor, though, needs to submit documents relevant to the said gifts or donations in order to substantiate the claim for deductibility from the gross income.\n\nThe same section likewise provides that the DAP, its assets, acquisitions, income, and its operations and transactions shall be exempt from any and all taxes, fees, charges, imposts, licenses and assessments, direct or indirect, imposed by the Republic of the Philippines or any of its political subdivision or taxing authority thereof, except import taxes, duties and fees.

(PCGSLAI) for exemption from the imposition of gross receipts tax (GRT) under Revenue Memorandum Circular (RMC) No. 09-2016, being a non-stock savings and loan association (NSSLA) organized and operated exclusively for the mutual benefit of its members.\n\nIt is represented (through a Joint Affidavit dated November 19, 2020) that PCGSLAI is an NSSLA organized under Republic Act (RA) No. 8367; that PCGSLAI is not transacting business with the public but catering only to members belonging to a well-defined group comprising of the Philippine Coast Guard's active and retired personnel and immediate members of their families; that PCGSLAI is a member of Alliance of Non-Stock Savings and Loan Association, Inc. (ANSLI); and that as member of the ANSLI it is exempt from paying GRT pursuant to Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 9-2004 and on the letter of then Commissioner of the Bureau of Internal Revenue, Caesar R. Dulay, which states that NSSLA may be exempt from GRT if they can prove that they do not engage in activities as Non-Bank Financial Intermediaries (NBFI) as defined under RR No. 9-2004. ETHIDa\n\nHence this request.\n\nIn reply, please be informed that Section 3 of RA No. 8367, entitled \"An Act Providing for the Regulation of the Organization and Operation of Non-Stock Savings and Loan Associations,\" defines NSSLAs as \"a non-stock, non-profit corporation engaged in the business of accumulating the savings of its members and using such accumulations for loans to members to service the needs of households by providing long term financing for home building and development and for personal finance.\" The said law also provides tax exemption to NSSLAs as provided under Section 5 thereof, to wit:\n\n\"SECTION 5. TAX EXEMPTION. \u2014 An Association shall be exempt from payment of tax in respect to income it receives, including interest on its deposits with any bank: Provided, however, that income derived from any of its properties, real or personal, or any activity conducted for profit, regardless of the disposition thereof, is subject to the corresponding internal revenue taxes imposed under the National Internal Revenue Code. Interest earnings on deposits of members with Associations as well as the shares of its members from the net income of the Associations shall be exempt from income tax.\"\n\nAccordingly, RMC No. 9-2016 was issued to clarify the taxability of NSSLAs for purposes of income tax, gross receipts tax and documentary stamp tax. The said RMC provides that NSSLAs are under the direct supervision and regulation of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) and, for regulatory purposes, they are classified as NBFIs under the BSP Manual of Regulations. Hence, NSSLA is generally subject to GRT on income derived from its operations, unless otherwise exempted under existing laws and/or regulations. TIADCc\n\nRelative thereto, RR No. 9-2004, entitled \"Implementing Certain Provisions of Republic Act No. 9238, Re-Imposing the Gross Receipts Tax on Banks and Non-Bank Financial Intermediaries Performing Quasi-Banking Functions and Other Non-Bank Financial Intermediaries Beginning January 1, 2004,\" defines NBFIs as follows:\n\n\"2.3. Non-bank Financial Intermediaries \u2014 shall refer to persons or entities whose principal functions include the lending, investing or placement of funds or evidences of indebtedness or equity deposited with them, acquired by them or otherwise coursed through them, either for their own account or for the account of others. This includes all entities regularly engaged in the lending of funds or purchasing of receivables or other obligations with funds obtained from the public through the issuance, endorsement or acceptance of debt instruments of any kind for their own account, or through the issuance of certificates of assignment or similar instruments with recourse, trust certificates, or of repurchase agreements, whether any of these means of obtaining funds from the public is done on a regular basis or only occasionally.\" (Emphasis and Underscoring Ours)\n\nClearly, RR No. 9-2004 imposes GRT on NBFIs engaged in the lending of funds or purchasing of receivables or obligations with funds obtained from the public. RMC No. 9-2016 further clarified that NBFIs are generally subject to GRT on income derived from its operation, unless otherwise exempted under special rules. Thus, PCGSLAI must be organized and operated exclusively for the mutual benefit of its members. RA No. 8367 requires that all funds received from members are accumulated to be utilized for the common benefit of the members by providing long term financing for home building and development and for personal finance. Moreover, it expressly exempts NSSLAs from payment of tax in respect to income they receive, including interest on their deposits with any bank.\n\nBased on the foregoing, NSSLAs are subject to GRT if they are engaged in the business of being an NBFI as defined under RR No. 9-2004, that is, if the NSSLAs are obtaining funds from the public. However, it may be exempted from GRT if they can prove during audit by the Revenue District Office having jurisdiction over the principal office of the concerned NSSLAs that they do not obtain funds from any person or the public but only from its members and that its operations are exclusively for the benefit of their members. cSEDTC\n\nPerforce, since the issue at bar requires factual determination in proving entitlement to the fiscal incentive provided under RA No. 8367, this Office cannot issue the requested exemption from GRT of PCGSLAI based only on mere representation that it is a non-stock savings and loan association organized pursuant to RA No. 8367 and that it is not transacting business with the public, but catering only members belonging to a well-defined group comprising of the Philippine Coast Guard's active and retired personnel and immediate members of their families. Moreover, since the issue is relatively factual in nature, it is incumbent upon the PCGSLAI to prove, through submission of pertinent documents to the corresponding Revenue District Office, that it is a non-stock, non-profit savings and loan association organized pursuant to RA No. 8367 and that they are not engaged in the business of being an NBFI as defined under RR No. 9-2004 which is subject to GRT pursuant to RMC No. 9-2016.\n\nPlease bear in mind that, being a non-stock savings and loan association does not, by this reason alone, completely exempt an institution from tax. Thus, statutes granting tax exemptions are construed strictissimi juris against the taxpayer and liberally in favor of the taxing authority. A claim of tax exemption must be clearly shown and based on language in law too plain to be mistaken. Otherwise stated, taxation is the rule, exemption is the exception. The burden of proof rests upon the party claiming the exemption to prove that it is in fact covered by the exemption so claimed. [1]\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be disclosed that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) ROMEO D.

Rodriguez Sr., Cubao, Quezon City 1102\n\nAttention: AAA\n_______________\n\nGentlemen :\n\nThis refers to your request for exemption from the payment of withholding tax on the retirement benefits of the following retiring employees:\n\nName\n\nDate of Birth\n\nDate Hired\n\nDate of Retirement\n\nAge\n\nYears in Service\n\nBBB\n\n00/00/0000\n\n12/01/2003\n\n06/07/2024\n\n00\n\n20.50\n\nCCC\n\n00/00/0000\n\n04/17/2008\n\n06/14/2024\n\n00\n\n16.19\n\nDocuments show that Isometric Diagonal Scheme, Inc. (the \"Company\") is a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the Republic of the Philippines. The Company entered into a Retirement Agreement with the above employees dated June 5, 2024 and June 3, 2024, respectively. DETACa\n\nIn reply, please be informed that based on Section 32 (B) (6) (a) of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended, if the company maintains a private retirement plan which has been determined by the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) as a \"reasonable retirement benefit plan,\" the retirement benefits that will be received by the employees shall be exempt from income tax, provided that the two (2) conditions are met, viz.: (1) the employee had been in the service of the same private firm for at least ten (10) years; and (2) he is at least fifty (50) years old at the time of retirement. However, even if the company maintains a retirement plan but was not approved by the BIR as a \"reasonable retirement benefit plan,\" the provisions of Republic Act (RA) No. 7641 shall apply.\n\nUnder Section 1 of RA No. 7641, in the absence of an approved reasonable retirement plan providing for retirement benefits of employees in the establishment, the retirement benefits that will be received by the employees shall be exempt from income tax, provided that the two (2) conditions are met, viz.: (1) the employee had been in the service for at least five (5) years; and (2) he is at least sixty (60) years old but not beyond sixty-five (65) years old at the time of retirement.\n\nIt appearing that the Company has no existing retirement plan approved by the BIR for its employees which provides retirement and gratuity benefits, RA No. 7641 shall apply. Under Section 1 of RA No. 7641, in order that the employee benefits received may be granted tax exemption, the following must be present: (1) the employee had been in the service for at least five (5) years; and (2) he is at least sixty (60) years old but not beyond sixty-five (65) years old at the time of retirement. Considering that BBB and CCC met the above requirements, their retirement benefits shall be excluded from their gross income and shall be exempt from taxation. HEITAD\n\nPlease take note also that pursuant to Section 2.78.1 of Revenue Regulations No. 2-98, as amended, the terminal pay, i.e., commutation and payment of monetized unused vacation leave credits not exceeding ten (10) days during the year are not subject to income tax and consequently to the withholding tax. Conversely, the cash equivalent of vacation leave exceeding ten (10) days is subject to tax. However, this same principle cannot apply to sick leave credits since an employee must actually go on sick leave to be able to avail of said leave credits.\n\nIt is, however, understood that this exemption does not include the payment of the separated employees' salaries and the payment of the 13th month pay and other benefits in excess of the P90,000.00 [1] threshold under Section 2.78.1 (A) (3) (a) and (A) (7) of Revenue Regulations No. 2-98, as amended.\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be ascertained that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) ROMEO D.
