San Francisco, Tagaytay City and one (1) class \"A\" share of the Makati Sports Club, Inc. covered by Certificate No. A-3077. HTcADC\n\nIt is represented that the subject properties were forfeited in favor of the Republic of the Philippines by virtue of a final judgment by the Supreme Court in the case of Heirs of Jolly Bugarin vs. Republic of the Philippines. [1] As a designated disposition entity by the Privatization Council (PrC), the Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG) sold the abovementioned properties through public auction to AAA on September 23, 2024. Relative to payment of taxes, the bid documents for the sale of the said properties as well as the Deed of Absolute Sale provide that transfer costs, registration fees, documentary stamps, notarial fees and other costs related to the sale shall be for the account of the successful bidder while CGT, VAT and real property taxes that may have accrued prior to the execution of the Deed of Sale, shall be shouldered by the Seller.\n\nIn reply, Section 32 (B) (7) (b) of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended (Tax Code) provides that:\n\n\"SEC. 32.

CAIHTE\n\nxxx xxx xxx\"\n\nThe Tax Code expressly excludes from gross income, and exempts from income tax, the income derived from the discharge of any essential governmental functions accruing to the Government of the Philippines or to any of its political subdivisions. Since the sale conducted by the PCGG is pursuant to its mandate or in the exercise of essential governmental functions accruing to the Government of the Philippines, [2] then it is exempt from income taxes, and consequently, from CGT, a final tax of six percent (6%) upon the capital gains presumed to have been realized from the sale.\n\nFurthermore, please be informed that Executive Order No. 286 dated July 25, 1987, which created the Sequestered Assets Disposition Authority (SADA) to oversee the disposition of, among others, assets to the PCGG, provides for the exemption of SADA from the payment of taxes, fees and charges under Section 5 thereof, which reads as follows:\n\n\"SEC. 5. Exemption from Taxes, Fees and other Charges. \u2014 The provisions of any law to the contrary notwithstanding, the Authority as well as the sequestered corporations and assets transferred to it, shall be exempt from all taxes, fees, charges, imposts, and assessments arising from or occasioned by the passing of title over such corporations or assets from the said corporations to the Authority and/or from the National Government to a private acquisitor or buyer imposed by the National Government or any subdivision thereof; Provided, that in case where government institutions acquired the said assets by foreclosure, the non-payment of similar taxes, fees, charges, imposts and assessments shall not be a bar to the consolidation of title in the foreclosing institutions and the subsequent passing of title to the Authority.\n\nThe sale or transfer of such corporations of assets shall not be enjoined or hindered by the existence of any liens by way of taxes, charges or other assessments in favor of the government at the time of sale or transfer; Provided, that the proceeds from such sale or transfer shall be subject to the tax lien and shall first be applied to satisfy such obligations secured by such liens.\"\n\nThe exemption from taxes, fees, charges, imposts, and assessments was given to the PCGG when SADA was transferred to the PCGG by virtue of Executive Order No. 149 dated December 28, 1993 on the \"Streamlining of the Office of the President\" which provides that:\n\n\"3.3 Transfer of Regular Agencies for Administrative Supervision and Eventual Abolition.

EcTCAD\n\nPNOC EC is the upstream oil, gas and coal subsidiary of the state-owned Philippine National Oil Company (\"PNOC\"). It is a government-owned or controlled corporation (\"GOCC\") mandated by the government through the Department of Energy to take the lead in exploration, development, and production of the country's oil, gas, and coal resources.\n\nIt is represented that as a GOCC without a charter, PNOC EC is not under the authority of the Civil Service Commission (CSC) under the 1987 Constitution [1] and is not covered by Civil Service Laws pursuant to CSC MC No. 5, series of 2021.\n\nThe Social Security System (\"SSS\") certified that PNOC EC is duly registered with the SSS as an employer on July 1, 1976. Pursuant to RA No. 11210 and the Implementing Rules and Regulations of RA No. 11199 or the Social Security Law, PNOC EC grants its female pregnant employees maternity leave benefits or a full pay based on the employee's average monthly salary credit for the 105-day leave and a salary differential to be paid, if any.\n\nIn this regard, a legal opinion is requested as to whether the maternity leave benefits, including the salary differential, granted to PNOC EC's employees is exempt from income tax considering that PNOC EC is a GOCC without a charter and is registered with the SSS.\n\nIn reply, Section 3 of RA No. 11210 grants any female pregnant employee a maternity leave of 105 days with full pay. This full pay shall consist of the SSS maternity benefit computed based on the employee's average daily salary credit and salary differential to be paid by the employer, if any. [2] The salary differential to be paid by the employer is the difference between the full salary of the female employee during her maternity leave and the actual cash benefits received from the SSS. [3] SDHTEC\n\nIn connection therewith, Section 2.78.1 (B) (1) (e) of Revenue Regulations No. 2-98 exempts from withholding tax on compensation the payments of benefits made under the Social Security Law, viz.:\n\n\"2.78.1. WITHHOLDING OF INCOME TAX ON COMPENSATION INCOME. \u2014 (B) Exemptions from Withholding Tax on Compensation. \u2014 The following income tax payments are exempted from the requirement of withholding tax on compensation but may be subject to income tax depending on the nature/sources of income earned by the individual recipient.\n\n(1) Renumerations received as an incident of employment, as follows:\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(e) Payments of benefits made under the Social Security Act of 1954, as amended; and\"\n\nIn addition, the Bureau of Internal Revenue clarified in Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 105-2019 that the full pay maternity benefit includes the salary differential as its component. Therefore, the salary differential is considered part of the maternity benefit. Considering that the above-quoted provision does not provide any qualification in granting tax exemption on payments of benefits under the SSS law, the maternity benefits, including the salary differential, are exempt from income and withholding taxes. [4] Thus, the exemption from income and withholding taxes covers the full pay SSS maternity benefit consisting of the employee's average daily salary credit and salary differential.\n\nThis ruling is issued on the basis of the facts as represented. However, if upon investigation it shall be disclosed that the actual facts are different, then this ruling shall be without force and effect insofar as the herein parties are concerned.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.)
