HTcADC\n\nThe Document Processing Divisions (DPDs) have raised issues in the Estate Tax Amnesty Returns (ETARs) (BIR Form No. 2118-EA) transmitted to the said office. The following issues that has been observed are curtailing the encoding of these returns.\n\nA. RETURNS ARE NOT COMPLETELY FILLED-OUT\n\nIt was observed that the returns being transmitted to the DPDs are not completely filled-up. The schedules and other fields on the second page are left blank.\n\nIt should be noted that Section II (2) of the abovementioned RMO clearly states that:\n\n\"2. The RDO shall verify the completeness and correctness of the documentary requirements as enumerated in the Estate Tax Amnesty Returns (ETARs) (BIR Form No. 2118-EA), and ensure that all fields of the said return are completely and accurately filled-up. In case there are items which are not applicable to the taxpayer, the words \"Not Applicable\" or \"N.A.\" shall be indicated on the space provided.\"\n\nFurthermore, in Section III (7) the One-Time Transactions (ONETT) Team Revenue Officer and the Group Supervisor are both instructed to assist the tax filer, to wit:\n\n\"7. Assist the filer in filling up the ETAR, upon receipt of the complete documents, and ensure that all fields of the return are completely and accurately filled up. In case there are items which are not applicable to the taxpayer, the words \"Not-Applicable\" or \"N.A.\" shall be indicated on the subject fields\";\n\nB. ONLY PHOTOCOPIES OF ETARS ARE TRANSMITTED TO THE DPD\n\nAs reported, there had been instances when only photocopies of the ETARs were transmitted to the DPD with the reason that the taxpayer filed/accomplished only one (1) copy of the ETAR.\n\nThis is contrary to the provision in Section II (10) of RMO No. 33-2019 which states that the RDO shall transmit to the concerned DPD the original copy of the ETAR for encoding to the DEM. Considering that the ONETT Team is mandated to assist the taxpayer filing the ETAR, the same should have been advised to file/accomplish the return in triplicate as instructed in Section 9 of Revenue Regulations No. 6-2019, to wit: aScITE\n\n\"x x x. . . After payment, the duly accomplished and sworn ETAR and APF with proof of payment, together with the complete documentary requirements shall be immediately submitted to the RDO in triplicate copies. X x x\"\n\nIn Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 68.2019, the answer to question number \"8\" even identifies the three (3) parties to whom each copy of the ETAR should go to.\n\nOriginal \u2014 Document Processing Division (DPD)\n\nDuplicate \u2014 Docket file\n\nTriplicate \u2014 Taxpayer's Copy\n\nIt should also be reminded that the Client Support Section (CSS) of the RDO should validate the existing Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) in the Integrated Tax System (ITS) to determine if there was a previously filed estate tax return and if the heirs have existing TIN. If none, a TIN should be issued for the purpose.\n\nImportance should be given the abovementioned concerns and stringent implementation of the provisions stating the policies, guidelines and procedures in the processing of Estate Tax Amnesty Availment should be followed in view of the need for complete accurate information that will be part of the Tax Amnesty Program database and in anticipation of the data that will be required by the Department of Finance.\n\nLastly, the DPDs are instructed to return to the RDO for their correction, all the ETARs that falls short of the compliance requirements or has inconsistencies with the reiterated policies, guidelines and procedures above. The RDO shall then correct/complete the ETAR returned by the DPDs and transmit the same back to the DPD when ETARS are corrected/completed.\n\nStrict compliance is hereby enjoined.\n\n(SGD.)

The Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) of the transacting client and the APT for each transaction must be indicated in the working paper, which will then be computed to come up with the APT for the month.\n\nBased on the foregoing, the working paper (Annex 'B') shall only form part of the CSS record and as a supplementary document to the actual report (Annex 'A') for reference and validation purposes; hence, the new format of the report shall be used in the preparation of the report effective October 2019. The said report shall be submitted to the Office of the Assistant Commissioner, Client Support Service, Attention: The Chief, Taxpayer Service Programs and Monitoring Division via email at tspmd_tas@bir.gov.ph on or before the 10th day of the following month.\n\nFor your strict compliance.\n\n(SGD.)

The new list of TWAs shall refer to those taxpayers whose gross sales/receipts, gross purchases or claimed deductible itemized expenses, as the case may be, amounting to TWELVE MILLION PESOS (P12,000,000.00) or more as declared in their duly-filed 2018 Annual Income Tax Returns (BIR Form Nos. 1701 and 1702).\n\nAccordingly, those top withholding agents under the existing list of TWAs who shall qualify under the above criteria of RR No. 7-2019 shall remain as such and therefore the newspaper publication requirement shall no longer be necessary since their names were already included in the previously published lists as TWAs.\n\n2. The concerned RDOs shall identify taxpayers under their jurisdiction who shall qualify as TWAs according to the above-prescribed criteria. These qualified taxpayers shall be included in the list of taxpayers for inclusion as TWAs which shall be subsequently published in the newspaper of general circulation.\n\n3. Those existing TWAs who did not qualify to the new prescribed criteria, including those enumerated below notwithstanding their satisfaction to the new criteria, shall be included in the list for deletion which shall likewise be published in the newspaper of general circulation.\n\na. National government agencies, government-owned or controlled corporations, state universities and colleges, and local government units;\n\nb. Taxpayers who were included because of one-time transactions (i.e., estate and donor's tax);\n\nc. Individual taxpayers deriving income on commission basis such as but not limited to insurance agent, and real estate broker, subject to verification of their duly-filed 2018 Quarterly Income Tax Returns (BIR Form No. 1701Q) in order to determine the regularity of their transactions.

The said certification shall form part of the docket;\n\n1.3 Transferor-taxpayer(s)/registered owner(s) of the foreclosed property(ies) certified with no existing record or TIN as of the date of transaction shall use the TIN for involuntary transfer in Item No. 3 of this Memorandum. Only owners of the foreclosed property(ies) by BSP, PAF, LGU in the list submitted by HDMF shall use the assigned TINs for involuntary transfer of properties.\n\n2.

The filing of an amended Estate Tax Amnesty Return (ETAR), by any one (1) of the decedents, whose previous ETAR was filed in only one (1) Revenue District Office (RDO) together with the ETAR of all other decedents involved in multiple succession, shall be at the RDO having jurisdiction over the last residence of the said decedent. In this regard, no deduction shall be allowed on the gross estate covering the property to be declared subsequently, except for the share of the surviving spouse, if applicable.\n\n2. The Acceptance Payment Form (APF) (BIR Form No. 0621-EA) shall be approved and endorsed by the Revenue District Officer for payment after pre-evaluation of the complete documentary requirements submitted by the filer and upon computation of the estate tax amnesty due.\n\n3. The pre-evaluation period shall not exceed thirty (30) days from the receipt of the complete documentary requirements as enumerated in the Estate Tax Amnesty Return (ETAR) (BIR Form No. 2118-EA).\n\n4. The date when the filer should return to get the APF shall be indicated on the space with \"APF release date __________,\" provided on the \"Complete\" portion of the Checklist of Documentary Requirements.\n\n5. The exceptions under Section 3 of Revenue Regulations No. 6-2019 shall be printed on the lower portion of the Certificate of Availment (CA), to read as follows:\n\n\"In case there are properties covered under Section 3 of RR No. 6-2019 which are included in the application for estate tax amnesty, the application pertaining to such properties shall be considered null and void.\"\n\nA sample of the CA with the above notation is attached herewith.\n\n6. The details of the property/ies included in the judicial settlement/last will of testament pending in court shall be encoded on the lower portion of the CA or at the back of the same with the words \"x x x Nothing Follows x x x\" at the end of the list.\n\n7. The failure to submit the validated APF with proof of payment to the RDO concerned on or before the lapse of the two-year availment period is tantamount to non-availment of the estate tax amnesty.\n\n8. The Certificate of Zonal Values of Real Properties shall not be required since all schedules of zonal valuation can be verified from the BIR Portal/Website.

No. 222743) dated 05 April 2017, in which the Court held that the \"assessment issued against Medicard Philippines, Inc. is hereby declared unauthorized for having been issued without a Letter of Authority by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue or his duly authorized representatives.\"\n\nRevenue Memorandum Circular (RMC) No. 75-2018 dated September 5, 2018 emphasized and clarified that any tax assessment issued without a Letter of Authority (LOA) is a violation of taxpayer's right to due process and is therefore \"inescapably void.\" Thus, any assessment issued pursuant to a Letter Notice (LN) which was not replaced by LOA is invalid and, therefore, should be cancelled and/or withdrawn. DETACa\n\nIn order to resolve the issues on assessments issued based on LNs not replaced by LOAs, which have become final, executory and demandable, including disputed/protested assessments, the following guidelines shall be observed:\n\n1. The Revenue District Offices (RDOs), Assessment Divisions (ADs), Collection Divisions (CDs), and Legal Divisions (LDs) under the Revenue Regional Offices, as well as the Legal and Legislative Division (LLD), Accounts Receivables Monitoring Division (ARMD), Large Taxpayers Audit Divisions (LTADs) under the LTS and Large Taxpayers Collection Enforcement Division (LTCED) in the National Office shall prepare inventory lists of all LN dockets in their custody. The inventory lists shall be submitted in hard and soft copies to the Audit Information, Tax Exemption and Incentives Division (AITEID) within five (5) days from issuance of this memorandum, using the format prescribed in Annex \"A\" hereof. The soft copy of the list shall be sent through email address aiteid@bir.gov.ph.\n\n2. For protested/disputed LN cases which were referred to the LD or LLD for confirmatory ruling or opinion, the office having custody of the dockets shall refer the dockets with a transmittal list to the concerned RDO or LT Division, for evaluation in accordance with paragraph no. 3 below. A copy of the transmittal list shall be furnished to the Assessment Service, Attention: AITEID.\n\n3. Assessments covered by LNs which are dated prior to January 2010 shall no longer be pursued and the aforesaid offices shall recommend the issuance of Authority to Cancel Assessment (ATCA) in accordance with the policies and guidelines prescribed in Revenue Memorandum Order (RMO) No. 33-2018.\n\nFor assessments covered by LNs which are dated January 2010 and onwards; the concerned RDOs, ADs, CDs, ARMD, LTADs and LTCED, where the case/docket is pending, shall evaluate the discrepancies involved per LN based on the Details of Discrepancies attached to the Final Assessment Notice (FAN)/Formal Letter of Demand (FLD) or Final Decision on Disputed Assessment (FDDA).\n\nIf the discrepancy is 30% or less, the concerned office shall recommend for the issuance of ATCA since the assessment is no longer within the three (3)-year period to assess prescribed in Section 203 of the 1997 Tax Code, as amended. However, if the discrepancy is more than thirty percent (30%) and the 10-year prescriptive period to assess has not yet prescribed pursuant to Section 222 (a) of the 1997 Tax Code, as amended, based on the date of the LN as the reckoning date, it shall be referred for issuance of electronic Letter of Authority (eLA) to the concerned Regional Investigation Division (RID) under the Revenue Region having jurisdiction over the RDO where the taxpayer is registered, or to the National Investigation Division (NID) in case the taxpayer is registered as large taxpayer. A copy of the referral/transmittal to the RID or NID, as the case may be, shall be furnished to the Assessment Service, Attention: AITEID. aDSIHc\n\nUpon receipt by the RID/NID of the LN cases, it shall prepare a list of taxpayers with LN cases for issuance of eLAs for the approval of the Regional Director or Assistance Commissioner, Enforcement and Advocacy Service (EAS). Upon approval, the RID/NID shall request for a \"Data Fix\" in order to generate the eLAs for the LN cases, through the Electronic Letter of Authority Monitoring System (ELAMS). The requests, together with the approved lists shall be referred to the Assessment Service, Attention: AITEID.\n\n4. The RID/NID shall ensure that the report of investigation shall be transmitted to the concerned reviewing offices not later than six (6) months prior to the end of the ten (10)-year period to assess pursuant to Section 222 (a) of the 1997 Tax Code, as amended.\n\nFor strict and immediate compliance.\n\n(SGD.)

Thus, as a general policy, only one electronic Letter of Authority (eLA) is issued for each taxable year or period covering the audit/investigation of all internal revenue tax liabilities of the taxpayer, except when a specific tax type had been previously examined (e.g., audit of VAT liabilities under the VAT Audit Program, audit of VAT arising from claim for tax refund/Tax Credit Certificate).\n\nIn line with the said provision, in the reassignment of cases to another Revenue Officer (RO) due to transfer to another office, retirement, resignation, etc., of the original RO handling the case, the Revenue District Officer (RDO) issues a Memorandum of Assignment (MOA) to the new RO for the continuation of the audit/investigation. We issue a MOA, using a pre-numbered accountable form in order to monitor and tract the reassignment of cases. However, in the recent decisions issued by the Court, there must be an authority in the form of an LA given to the RO, otherwise the examination or assessment is void (McDonald's Philippine Realty Corporation vs. CIR, CTA Case No. 8655; Ithiel Corporation vs. CIR, CTA Case No. 8689; Strawberry Foods Corporation vs. CIR, CTA Case No. 8569).\n\nIn view of the foregoing, the issuance of a MOA for reassignment of cases in the aforementioned instances shall be discontinued. However, before the RDO can request for the issuance for the replacement eLA, the previous eLA must be cancelled by the Regional Director.\n\nIn requesting for the eLA replacement, aside from the name of the new RO/Group Supervisor (GS), the LOA No. of the cancelled eLA shall be encoded and the appropriate reason (e.g., resignation of the RO, retirement of the RO, transfer of the RO to another district office) must be selected from the \"List of Reason for LOA replacement\" that will be displayed in the \"Electronic Letter of Authority Request Data Entry\" screen. The said information is necessary so that the replacement eLA reassigning the case to another RO/GS will have a notation at the bottom of the new eLA as follows:\n\n\"This is a replacement of Letter of Authority No. _____________ dated __________________ for the continuation of audit of herein tax liabilities for the taxable period from __________________ to __________________ arising from the reassignment of the case due to ____________________________________.\"\n\nFor your information and guidance.\n\n(SGD.)

                                    "Details": "It has been observed that, based on the information generated from the Integrated Tax System (ITS) of this Bureau, there is a continuing increase of stop-filer cases and a very dismal resolution rate thereof by all concerned Revenue District Offices (RDOs)/Large Taxpayers Service (LTS) offices. As of May 2016, records showed that there are 116,721,224 open stop-filer cases. Out of this number, there are 2,985,095 open stop-filer cases for taxpayers under the Taxpayer Account Management Program (TAMP). On the other hand, there are 113,736,129 unresolved stop-filer cases for non-TAMP taxpayers. In terms of the performance of the concerned revenue district offices in resolving these stop-filer cases, the resolution rates of only 0.60% and 0.41% of the total handled stop-filer cases, for TAMP and non-TAMP taxpayers, respectively, have been attained by these offices; and, such average performance is way below the set Key Performance Indicator (KPI) prescribed under Revenue Memorandum Order (RMO) No. 36-2014, in relation to RMO No. 41-2011.\n\nIt is further noted that these unresolved stop-filer cases arose from registration-related issues, more particularly the current registration status of the concerned taxpayers under the Integrated Tax System-Registration System (ITS-REG)/Electronic Tax Information System-Tax Registration System (eTIS-TRS), that need to be resolved the soonest time possible, as well as the failure by the concerned revenue offices to encode the applicable tax returns that are being monitored by ITS for purposes of generation of stop-filer cases. Moreover, it was observed that there were substantial backlogs in the uploading of returns/collection data from tax returns filed/payments made through the Mobile Revenue Collection Officers System (MRCOS), eBIR Forms, Electronic Filing and Payment System (eFPS), GCash, Limited Bank Data Entry System (LBDES) that gave rise to invalid stop-filer cases.\n\nWhile the procedural requirements on the handling and resolution of stop-filer cases are already prescribed under Revenue Memorandum Order (RMO) No. 41-2011, more specifically with respect to the immediate updating of taxpayers' registration data, prompt encoding of the tax returns filed by taxpayers, and the uploading to the ITS of returns/collection data from the tax returns filed/payments made thru the different filing/payment channels of this Bureau, there is an immediate need to address the substantial volume of open stop-filer cases arising from the aforementioned issues, as well as forestall the further accumulation thereof.\n\nIn view of the foregoing and considering that the bulk of stop-filer cases for non-TAMP taxpayers may be \"invalid\" and that the case-by-case resolution thereof may require substantial resources from the concerned offices which may, at the end, will no longer be \"cost-effective\", the immediate automatic closure of these cases may be undertaken by the Bureau. This policy direction is considered strategic because it will enable all the concerned RDOs/Chiefs, LTS Offices to re-direct their scarce resources to more productive activities that will improve their collection performance.\n\nAccordingly, the following policies and procedures shall be strictly observed by all concerned revenue offices:\n\nA. The Systems Development Division (SDD) under Information Systems Group (ISG) shall generate a list of all open stop-filer cases of taxpayers whose registration status in the ITS-REG/eTIS-TRS are already tagged as either \"C-Cancelled\" or \"D-Dissolved\" for transmission to all the concerned RDOs/LTS Offices, thru the Revenue Data Centers (RDCs)/National Office Data Center (NODC), on or before November 4, 2016. The RDOs/LTS Offices shall verify the aforementioned list and submit written explanations/justifications to the Assistant Commissioner-Client Support Service (ACIR-CSS) citing the reasons why the said stop-filer cases were not resolved/closed prior to the tagging of the registration status of the concerned taxpayers in the ITS-REG/eTIS-TRS as either \"C-Cancelled\" or \"D-Dissolved\", copy furnished the Chief, Collection Performance Monitoring Division (CPMD) for monitoring purposes. The ACIR-CSS shall evaluate the said written explanations and should the same are found meritorious, transmit to the SDD the list of stop-filer cases covered by the meritorious explanations for closure by the said Division. For unmeritorious explanations, the same shall be referred to the appropriate revenue office for the necessary actions thereon. CAIHTE\n\nB. The SDD under the ISG shall generate separate lists of all open stop-filer cases by non-TAMP taxpayers as of September 30, 2016 grouped as follows:\n\n1. Taxpayers who have failed to file any tax return and/or pay the corresponding tax due thereon for at least three (3) years prior to the date stated above;\n\n2. Taxpayers who failed to file any tax return and/or pay the corresponding tax due thereon from the date of registration with this Bureau, excluding the taxpayers identified in the immediately preceding paragraph;\n\n3. Taxpayers whose form type was erroneously registered in the ITS-REG/eTIS-TRS; and\n\n4. Taxpayers with open stop-filer cases created in the former revenue district office/LTS Office (old) before their transfer to another RDO/LTS Office (new).\n\nIn the generation of the abovementioned lists, the SDD shall take into consideration the \"invalid\" stop-filer cases that may have been created due to backlog in the encoding of the pertinent tax returns and/or unuploading of tax returns/payment data in the ITS through the different filing/payment channels such as MRCOS, eBIR Forms, eFPS, Mobile Payment (e.g., GCash), LBDES, etc.\n\nFurthermore, if the concerned taxpayers are paying the Annual Registration Fees and regularly filing their income tax returns and other tax returns and/or paying the corresponding taxes thereon, the same shall be included in generating the list of open stop-filer cases due to erroneously registered form type referred to in Item 3 above.\n\nC. The soft copies of all the lists prescribed in Item B above shall be transmitted by the concerned RDCs/NODC to the RDOs/LTS Offices under their jurisdictions, copy furnished the Chief, CPMD, on or before November 11, 2016. The RDOs/LTS Offices shall conduct validation of the open stop-filer cases included in the transmitted list and prepare a written report thereon with a recommendation on the closure/non-closure of open stop-filers referred to in Items B.1, B.2 and B.3 above, for submission to the Chief, CPMD on or before December 12, 2016. The said written recommendation report shall be submitted together with a list of duly validated open stop-filer cases recommended for mass closure in accordance with the RDC/NODC-transmitted lists.\n\nThe CPMD shall monitor the compliance of all concerned RDOs/LTS Offices in the validation of the lists and the submission of the prescribed recommendation reports, as well as the conduct of pre-evaluation of their written recommendation reports, prior to the transmission thereof to the Validation Committee created through a Revenue Special Order (RSO) for appropriate action.\n\nThe Committee-validated reports confirming the closure of the open stop-filer cases (i.e., Items B.1, 2 and 3) shall be transmitted to the SDD for the immediate execution of closure thereof in the ITS-CMS. It shall be understood that the execution referred herein is not deemed to be a one-time mass closure execution of validated open stop-filer cases, but the same shall be for each and every receipt of the transmitted Committee-validated report.\n\nThe CPMD shall prepare and submit to the Deputy Commissioner for Operations and ACIR-CS a written report on the level of compliance by all RDOs/LTS Offices in the submission of the above-prescribed recommendation reports, actions undertaken by the Validation Committee, and results on the final execution by the SDD on the mass closure of these open stop-filer cases. The said report shall be submitted to the aforementioned officials on or before December 31, 2016, for their information and appropriate action.\n\nD. Stop-filer cases that are created due to non-uploading to the ITS/eTIS of the return/payment data listed below shall be considered as \"invalid\". These cases shall be automatically eligible for mass clean-up without the need for prior validation by the concerned revenue offices under this Order. However, taxpayers reported as \"Cannot be Located\" (CBL) are not included in the mass closure as discussed in the subsequent item letter \"F\".\n\n1. Tax returns filed thru the eFPS and eBIR Forms facilities;\n\n2. No-payment tax returns covered by the electronic Acknowledgement Receipts (eARs) and tax returns with tax payments covered by electronic Revenue Official Receipts (eRORs) generated thru MRCOS facility received by the RDOs;\n\n3. Tax returns filed thru Mobile Payment facility (e.g., GCash); and\n\n4. No-payment tax returns that were processed thru the Data Imaging Project in pilot RDOs.\n\nE. Based on the ISG-generated list of open stop-filer cases, the concerned RDOs/Large Taxpayers Document Processing and Quality Assurance Division (LTDPQAD) shall conduct a verification to determine which among these cases were created due to non-encoding of the pertinent no-payment tax return data and/or non-encoding of return/payment data by the RDOs/DPDs/LTDPQAD for returns/payments received thru the Revenue Collection Officers (RCOs) prior to or during the implementation of the MRCOS. The RDOs shall create a list enumerating the names of the taxpayers included in the list of open stop-filer cases whose returns have been forwarded to the DPD/DPS. This shall be provided to the concerned DPD/DPS to enable them to validate the said list and issue a confirmation letter/certification confirming that the physical return(s) is/are under their possession, including the status of the return shall also be indicated, i.e., for pre-processing or for encoding. Since these open cases are not eligible for automatic mass closure, the RDOs must secure the said confirmation letter/certification from the concerned DPDs/DPSs stating that they have the physical possession of these un-encoded tax returns and the confirmation letter/certification shall be attached to the written recommendation report for submission to the Chief, CPMD.\n\nWith respect to the un-encoded collection data received by the RCOs that were not covered by the eRORs generated thru MRCOS, all concerned RDOs shall ensure that the same are duly encoded in the ITS-CBR/eTIS-CRR not later than November 11, 2016. On the other hand, the concerned DPDs/DPSs of the RDOs shall likewise ensure the encoding of the un-encoded tax returns data, giving priority to BIR Form Nos. 1701, 1702 series 2550Q and 2551M/Q, in the ITS-RPS/eTIS-RFP on or before the same deadline. DETACa\n\nWith respect to tax returns received by the RDOs/RCOs which were not yet transmitted to the DPDs/DPSs as of the effectivity of this Order, the original copies of these tax returns, their corresponding BCS-As and BCS-Bs, together with the attachments, shall be transmitted to the DPDs/DPSs not later than October 21, 2016. In the transmittal of these tax returns by the RDOs to the DPDs/DPSs, the returns should be batched according to taxable year and form type and each batch shall not exceed fifty (50) returns. Accordingly, the DPDs/DPSs shall likewise ensure that the tax return data for these stop-filer cases are duly encoded in the ITS-RPS/eTIS-RFP not later than December 12, 2016.\n\nThe resolution of the stop-filer cases created therefrom is not covered by this Order, but the same shall be handled pursuant to RMO No. 41-2011. Furthermore, a separate issuance shall be issued to address the issues on untransmitted tax returns, including the imposition of appropriate sanctions to the erring revenue officials/personnel.\n\nF. The mass closure of open stop-filer cases involving taxpayers that are reported as \"Cannot Be Located\" (CBL) taxpayers already published in the newspaper of general circulation and posted in the Bureau's website shall not be included in this Order. Prior to the generation of the list by SDD, the Audit Information Tax Exempt and Incentive Division (AITIED) under the Assessment Service (AS) shall provide the former with the updated list of all published CBL taxpayers. However, a separate list of open stop-filer cases by CBL taxpayers shall be generated by the SDD for transmission to the concerned RDOs thru their respective RDCs, for their appropriate action. The resolution of these open stop-filer cases shall be undertaken pursuant to RMO No. 41-2011.\n\nG. With respect to the list of open stop-filer cases created in the old RDO/LTS Office before the taxpayer's transfer to the new RDO/LTS Office referred to in Item B.4 above, the SDD thru the concerned RDCs shall likewise transmit the same to both the new and old RDOs/LTS Offices.\n\nThe stop-filer cases of the said taxpayers shall be resolved by the old revenue office since the same cannot be viewed in the ITS-Case Monitoring System (CMS) database of the new revenue office and the same remain with the old RDO. Inasmuch as the new RDO/LTS Office has direct communication with the concerned taxpayer, the proper coordination with the taxpayers and the old revenue office shall be made by the new RDO/LTS Office to enable the resolution and closure of open stop-filer cases in the old revenue office. Such coordination among these offices is necessary considering that the resolution thereof shall be for their mutual benefit.\n\nH. For TAMP taxpayers, as well as non-TAMP taxpayers who are intermittently/irregularly filing their tax returns and paying the corresponding tax due thereon, guidelines and policies in the resolution of open stop-filer cases prescribed under RMO No. 41-2011 shall be strictly complied with by all concerned revenue offices.\n\nI. For taxpayers with open stop-filer cases under Item Nos. B.1, B.2, and B.3 above, the concerned RDOs/LTS Offices shall effect the end-dating of the registration status of the applicable tax/form types in the ITS-REG/eTIS-TRS, upon validation of the lists, to prevent further accumulation of stop-filers cases for the affected tax/form types. However, should the Committee rejects the recommendation of the RDOs/LTS Offices, the reversal/updating, as the case may be, of the previously end-dated registration status of the concerned taxpayers shall be immediately undertaken upon receipt of notice from the Validation Committee.\n\nJ. The mass clean-up of open stop-filer cases for non-TAMP taxpayers under this Order shall be accomplished on or before December 31, 2016.\n\nK. For all other open stop-filer cases of TAMP and non-TAMP taxpayers, all concerned RDOs/LTS Offices shall continuously resolve the same to ensure that the prescribed minimum resolution rate of eighty percent (80%) of stop-filers handled pursuant to the Key Performance Indicator (KPI) set under the existing RMO has been attained.\n\nFor your information and strict implementation.\n\n(SGD.)

These occurrences may be either due to (a) non-opening of emailed files by the concerned Collection Section Chiefs; (b) non-validation and/or non-uploading thereof to the data warehouse, thru the FTP facility; or (c) emails received are not related to the alphalist submissions.\n\nIn this connection, the following compliance and exception reports on the above subject matter covering the taxable year 2015 shall be transmitted thru email to your end by your respective Revenue Data Centers (RDCs), copy furnished the Chief, Miscellaneous Operations Monitoring Division (MOMD), not later than September 30, 2016: ITAaHc\n\n1. Report on Compliance on the Monthly/Annual Alphalist of Payees/Employees TAMP and NON-TAMP (For Annual Alphalist and MAP) (Annex \"A\")\n\nThe report contains the list of registered withholding tax agents (WAs) and their respective registered withholding tax form types. The information on the taxpayers' compliance to the annually filed BIR Form Nos. 1604 CF and E are reflected in Columns 4 and 5 of the report while the information on the compliance to the BIR Form Nos. 1601 E, F and 1600 are listed on the succeeding columns on a per form type and monthly bases.\n\nThe filenames, dates and exact time of uploading of alphalist for compliant taxpayers and whose submissions are successfully uploaded in the data warehouse are indicated under their respective columns. On the other hand, the WAs who did not submit any alphalist or who have made submissions but the same failed to pass the Bureau's validation requirements are tagged with \"X\" marks.\n\n2. Exception Report on Un-uploaded Alphalist in the Data Warehouse TAMP and NON-TAMP (Annex \"B\")\n\nThe report contains the list of the registered withholding tax agents (WAs) that submitted the prescribed annual and monthly alphalists of employees/payees, but the said alphalists remained in the ITS repository and have not reached the data warehouse due to their failure to pass the second system-validation requirements, more specifically the validity of the Tax Identification Numbers (TINs) of the WAs or zero (0) bytes (i.e., the submitted files did not contain any information on the income payees).\n\nWhile the report has basically the same columnar headings as that of the compliance report described in Item No. 1 above, it bears an additional column per form type reflecting the reasons why the uploading to the data warehouse of the specific alphalist has been rejected.\n\n3. Report on Compliance on the Summary Alphalist of Withholding Taxes TAMP and NON-TAMP (For SAWT) (Annex \"C\")\n\nThis report basically contains the same information reflected in the \"Report on Compliance on the Monthly/Annual Alphalist of Payees/Employees TAMP and NON-TAMP (For Annual Alphalist and MAP).\" However, the information reflects the taxpayers' compliance to the submission of Summary Alphalist of Withholding Taxes (SAWT).\n\n4. Exception Report on Un-Uploaded Summary Alphalist of Withholding Taxes in the Data Warehouse TAMP and NON-TAMP (Annex \"D\")\n\nThe report contains the list of the registered payees that submitted the prescribed SAWT, but the said alphalists remained in the ITS repository and have not reached the data warehouse due to their failure to pass the second system-validation requirements, more specifically the validity of the Taxpayer Identification Numbers (TINs) of the WAs or zero (0) bytes (i.e., the submitted files did not contain any information on the income payees).\n\nWhile the report has basically the same columnar headings as that of the compliance report described in Item No. 1 above, it bears an additional column per form type reflecting the reasons why the uploading to the data warehouse of the specific alphalist has been rejected.\n\n5. Report on Compliance on the Uploaded Monthly/Annual Alphalist of Payees/Employees and SAWT in the Data Warehouse TAMP and NON-TAMP \u2014 with Registration Issues (Annex \"E\")\n\nIn addition to the compliance reports described in Item Nos. 1 and 3 above, this report contains the List of WAs/Payees whose submitted alphalists are successfully uploaded to the data warehouse; but with the following issues:\n\na. The alphalists were found in the data warehouse despite the existence of certain registration issues in the ITS-REG/eTIS-TRS, namely: (1) the tax/form type is not duly registered in the said system; (2) the tax/form type was already \"end dated\" in the said system, but the taxpayers still filed the alphalists; and, (3) the registration status of the concerned WA/payee in the said system is already C-CANCELLED; and\n\nb. Some WAs/payees have submitted the alphalists to the old RDOs but such WA/payees have already transferred to other RDOs before the date of extraction/generation of this report. This report is sorted on a per old RDO basis while the identity of the new RDO is indicated in the remarks column of the report. In compliance report described in Item No. 1, these WAs/payees are tagged with mark \"X\" as non-compliant with regards to the submission of the alphalist in the old RDO. CHTAIc\n\n6. Report of Transferred WAs/Payees with Uploaded Alphalist in the Data Warehouse (Annex \"F\")\n\nThis report, as a supplement to the report in Item No. 5 above, contains the WAs/payees that were transferred to other RDOs but their respective alphalists were already submitted to their respective former home RDOs before the date of extraction/generation of the compliance report described in Item No. 1 above. This supplemental list is sorted on a per current/new RDO basis while the identity of their former home RDO is indicated in the remarks column of the report. However, while these WAs/payees are tagged with mark \"X\" as non-compliant to the submission of the alphalists in the compliance report described in Item No. 1 above, the supplemental list contains the details on the submission of the alphalists (i.e., filenames, dates and exact time of uploading of alphalists) which were actually submitted in the former home RDO and uploaded to the data warehouse.\n\nFor purposes of preparation of the progress reports prescribed in Item No. 5 hereunder to be submitted by the RDOs, a quarterly updated compliance and exception reports prescribed above shall be generated and transmitted to the concerned RDOs thru email, copy furnished the Chief MOMD, not later than 20th day of the second month immediately following the end of each calendar quarter.\n\nIn order to ensure that the abovementioned minimal level of taxpayers' compliance, as well as the RDOs' performance on the submission and uploading of alphalists to the data warehouse, are uniformly addressed in an accurate and timely manner, all concerned RDOs and all revenue offices under Large Taxpayer Service shall, upon receipt of the aforementioned reports, shall strictly observe the following guidelines and procedures:\n\n1. Sort the reasons for non-uploading to the data warehouse that are identified in the respective exception reports on un-uploaded alphalists/MAP and SAWT, according to the nature thereof.\n\na. Invalid TIN of Taxpayer/Filer\n\ni. Check in the Integrated Tax System-Registration System (ITS-REGS)/Electronic Taxpayer Information System-Taxpayer Registration System (eTIS-TRS) whether or not the taxpayer has a duly registered TIN therein. If there is a duly registered TIN, inform the taxpayer, in writing, of the correct TIN and require the electronic re-submission of the alphalist using the correct TIN;\n\nii. In cases of submission of alphalists through the dedicated email to the RDO, the re-submitted alphalists shall be validated pursuant to Revenue Memorandum Circular (RMC) No. 5-2014. If the prescribed validation requirements have been satisfied, immediately upload the same to the ITS repository through the prescribed FTP facility. Otherwise, immediately inform the taxpayer in writing of any discrepancy for the resolution/correction thereof and require the re-submission of the corrected alphalist.\n\nb. Zero (0) bytes content of the alphalists\n\n1. Inform the taxpayer in writing that the Bureau's validation script has detected that the submitted alphalist did not contain any data/information, with the requirement to electronically re-submit the properly filled-up alphalist after the following has been determined:\n\na. MAP\n\nA record on the withholding tax payment (i.e., BIR Form Nos. 1601E, 1601F and 1600 has been verified in the ITS-Collection Bank Reconciliation System (CBRS)/eTIS-Collection and Remittance Reconciliation System (CRR).\n\nb. SAWT\n\nThere is a record of tax credit claim declared in the annual income tax (BIR Form Nos. 1701/1702) or in the quarterly income tax/VAT return (BIR Form Nos. 1701Q/1702Q/2550Q) submitted by the payee or income recipient, based on verification made with ITS-Return Processing System (RPS)/eTIS-Returns Filing Processing (RFP), or in the manually submitted returns that are not yet encoded in the ITS/eTIS, as the case may be.\n\nIn cases where there are no withholding tax payments by the WAs/income payors, or the filed annual/quarterly returns by the income payees did not contain any claim for tax credit, as verified from the ITS-CBR/RPS and/or eTIS-CRR/RFP, it shall be deemed that the WAs/income payors have no transaction subject to withholding taxes, or that the income payees did not receive any income subject to withholding taxes, and that the alphalists/SAWTs were submitted for administrative compliance purposes only. Accordingly, the taxpayer shall be informed in writing that the submission of alphalists/SAWT are no longer required under this case pursuant to Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 2-2006. This rule, however, shall not apply in cases of payments of compensation to employees whose income are exempt from withholding taxes in accordance to existing withholding tax regulations. EATCcI\n\nIn case of submission of alphalists through email, the re-submitted alphalists shall be validated pursuant to RMC No. 5-2014. If the prescribed validation requirements have been satisfied, immediately upload the alphalists to the ITS repository through the prescribed FTP facility. Otherwise, inform the taxpayer in writing on any noted discrepancy for the resolution thereof, and require the re-submission of the corrected alphalist.\n\n2. Segregate the WAs/payees who are tagged with \"X\" marks from the reports on compliance on annual/monthly alphalist/MAP and SAWT, and perform the procedures prescribed below.\n\na. Segregate from the WAs/payees who are tagged with \"X\" marks those that are not included in the exception reports on un-uploaded alphalist/MAP and SAWT.\n\nb. Check in the RDO's email account dedicated for submission of alphalists created under RMC No. 5-2014 whether or not the remaining WAs/payees who are tagged with \"X\" marks in the compliance reports, after the segregation procedure described in the preceding paragraph, are still in the RDO's dedicated email account and the same are still pending validation and uploading to the data warehouse. If the files are still in the said email account, perform the necessary validation requirements and immediately upload the same in the ITS repository thru the prescribed FTP facility, after the submitted alphalists have satisfied the validation requirements. For any noted discrepancy, immediately inform the concerned taxpayers, in writing, of the said discrepancy for the resolution thereof and require the electronic re-submission of the corrected alphalist.\n\nc. With respect to the other WAs/payees who were not determined to be included among the taxpayers identified in the immediately preceding Item b, determine whether or not these WAs/payees are included in the above-described supplemental report that identified the taxpayers who have actually submitted their alphalists in their former home RDOs. No further action shall be undertaken by the RDOs for taxpayers that are already included in the said supplemental report. However, in case of taxpayers that are not included therefrom, they shall be deemed to have not submitted the prescribed alphalist. Accordingly, these taxpayers shall be immediately required, in writing, to submit the prescribed alphalists.\n\nd. In cases where the failure of the WA/payee to submit the prescribed alphalists is due to erroneously registered tax/form type, verify/validate whether or not the concerned taxpayer has taxable transactions subject to withholding tax. If there are no taxable transactions, except in cases of payments of compensation to minimum wage employees that are exempt from withholding taxes, in accordance to the existing withholding tax regulations, require the concerned taxpayer to submit an updated BIR Form No. 1905 to end-date the applicable tax/form type in the ITS-REG/eTIS-TRS.\n\n3. Sort the issues/discrepancies on the ITS-REG/eTIS-TRS registration details identified in the compliance report described in Item No. 5 according to the nature of such issues/discrepancies, and undertake the applicable procedures, as follows:\n\na. Not Registered to tax/form type\n\nCheck the existing records (e.g., applicable tax returns, financial statements, etc.) previously filed by the concerned WAs/Payees with the RDO to determine whether or not there are transactions that are subject to withholding tax (i.e., compensation, expanded, final and government money payments). If there are taxable transactions, require the concerned taxpayers, in writing, to submit an updated BIR Form No. 1905, for purposes of registration of the appropriate tax/form type. However, if there is no taxable transaction, immediately inform, in writing, the taxpayer that the submission of alphalists/SAWT are no longer required under this case pursuant to Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 2-2006; provided, further, that this rule shall not apply in cases of payments of compensation to employees whose income are exempt from withholding taxes in accordance to existing withholding tax regulations. Moreover, it shall be further informed that in the event that taxable transactions shall arise in the future, the immediate registration of the proper tax/form type and the submission of the applicable alphalists shall still be required from the concerned taxpayers. DHITCc\n\nb. TP is registered in RDO <new RDO> \u2014\n\nCompliance on the submission of the alphalists of taxpayers that transferred from one RDO to another shall be checked from the Report of Transferred WAs/Payees with Uploaded Alphalists to the Data Warehouse mentioned in Item No. 2.c hereof to be provided by the concerned RDCs. Accordingly, no further action shall be made by the RDO where the concerned taxpayers are currently registered.\n\nc. Tax Type is end-dated effective <filing end date> \u2014\n\nCheck the registration information of the WAs/payees in the ITS-REG/eTIS-TRS and with the filed documents (e.g., TCL1, BIR Form No. 1905, LOAs issued for taxpayers retiring from business, etc.) for registration updates to determine whether or not the end-dating of the tax/form type was proper. If the end-dating thereof was erroneously made because the concerned taxpayers are still filing the prescribed alphalists, they shall be required to re-register the proper tax/form type.\n\nd. Taxpayer's registration code is inactive \u2014\n\nCheck the taxpayer's actual status in the ITS-REG/eTIS-TRS and the existing documents that authorized the tagging of the taxpayers' status to \"C-CANCELLED\" to prove whether or not the said status as indicated in the compliance report is valid. If the same is determined to be erroneous, the taxpayers' status shall be reverted to \"A-ACTIVE.\" If reason for the tagging of the taxpayers' registration status to \"C-CANCELLED\" was due to existence of multiple TINs and the concerned taxpayers have erroneously submitted the prescribed alphalists using the cancelled TINs, these taxpayers shall be immediately notified, in writing, to resubmit the prescribed alphalists using their correct active TINs.\n\n4. All taxpayers who failed to submit the prescribed alphalists shall be immediately imposed with the appropriate penalties. Moreover, while the taxpayers may have actually submitted the alphalists but the same failed to satisfy the validation requirements, a separate penalty shall be imposed against the taxpayer for each incorrectly accomplished and submitted alphalist, pursuant to the provisions of Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 5-2014.\n\n5. A quarterly progress reports (Annex \"G\" & \"H\") on the results of the actions undertaken on these compliance, exception and supplemental reports shall be prepared and submitted to the Collection Service, Attention: The Chief, Miscellaneous Operations Monitoring Division not later than 30th day of the second month immediately following the end of each calendar quarter, for monitoring purposes.\n\nThe progress report on the results of the actions taken on the compliance and exception reports transmitted to all concerned RDOs on or before September 30, 2016 as mentioned in the third paragraph of this OM shall be submitted thru email to MOMD on or before October 31, 2016 using the same format prescribed in the preceding paragraph.\n\n6. In order to minimize future incidents of unsuccessful uploading of alphalists to the data warehouse and continuous incorrect tagging of taxpayers as non-compliant in the submission of alphalists, the registration information in the ITS-REGS/eTIS-TRS of all registered WAs/payees under your respective jurisdiction shall be continuously cleansed, updated and/or validated pursuant to the existing rules and procedures (e.g., determination of the erroneously registered form/tax type(s), uploading of pre-generated TINs that are not yet captured in the ITS-REG/eTIS-TRS).\n\n7. The RDOs' dedicated email accounts for alphalists that were previously configured in the desk top personal computers (PCs) of all the concerned Collection Section Chiefs of RDOs shall be opened daily and checked for newly emailed alphalists for purposes of immediate validation thereof and subsequent uploading to the data warehouse thru the FTP facility.\n\nIn cases where these desktop PCs where such email accounts are configured can no longer be determined, such instance shall be immediately reported to the Bureau's Help Desk in order to secure technical assistance from the concerned RDCs for the reconfiguration of the email account to the Collection Section Chiefs' desktop PCs.\n\nFurther, it shall be ensured that these dedicated email accounts shall only be used for alphalist-related activities (e.g., receiving the taxpayers' emailed alphalists, uploading the same to the data warehouse, and the sending out of feedbacks to concerned taxpayers whether or not the emailed alphalists have passed the validation requirements, etc.), and not for any other purposes.\n\nConsidering that details of the aforesaid compliance and exception reports are segregated to Taxpayer Account Management Program (TAMP) and Non-TAMP taxpayers, actions on TAMP taxpayers shall be given utmost priority to ensure immediate compliance in the submission of the prescribed alphalists by this group of taxpayers. With respect to Non-TAMP taxpayers, however, and notwithstanding the aforementioned policy, the prescribed actions thereon shall nevertheless be immediately undertaken to enable the full monitoring of compliance by all concerned taxpayers in the submission of the prescribed alphalists. cEaSHC\n\nIt is likewise reminded that the submission of alphalist shall be made only thru the electronic modes of submission pursuant to the provisions of RR 1-2014, as clarified under RMC No. 5-2014. Accordingly, the manual submission thereof by taxpayers shall no longer be allowed. Further, if the taxpayers have already electronically submitted their respective alphalist, the submission of the hard copies thereof to the concerned RDOs/LTS Offices shall no longer be required from the concerned taxpayers.\n\nThe compliance and exception reports on the level of taxpayers' compliance with the submission of alphalists for taxable year 2016 and thereafter shall be regularly generated by the Information Systems Group and the same shall be electronically transmitted to the concerned RDOs, on or before the 30th day of the second month immediately following the end of each calendar quarter. The guidelines and procedures in handling and monitoring the disposition of these compliance and exception reports will be covered by a separate revenue issuance.\n\nThis Operations Memorandum Order shall take effect immediately.\n\n(SGD.)

Some concerned offices are waiting for the applicant's compliance (e.g., comply with the stop-filer cases, settle the tax liabilities, submit the necessary annual information returns, enroll in the electronic filing and payment system, etc.) before they accomplish the questionnaire attached in the Request for Verification (RFV) sent by the Accounts Receivable Monitoring Division (ARMD). As a consequence, ARMD could not act immediately on the submitted applications for ICC/BCC. ITAaHc\n\nIn view of the foregoing observation, you are hereby directed to accomplish immediately the aforesaid questionnaire within five (5) days from receipt hereof based on the current applicant's tax compliance (compliant or not) without the need to wait for the taxpayer to comply with the specific requirements and submit the same within the 5-day allotted period to the ARMD so that the latter could already render its decision on whether to approve or disapprove the application based on the prescribed criteria. Non-submission of the questionnaire within the 5-day period will mean that the concerned taxpayer-applicant has tax issue/concerns/problem with the District/Region concerned, thus, the application for ICC/BCC will be denied. It is expected that once applications for ICC/BCC of non-compliant taxpayers have been denied by ARMD, these taxpayers will go back to their respective district offices for purposes of satisfying all the compliance criteria set forth under existing issuances.\n\nFor prospective applicants for ICC/BCC, particularly those who will file application after the effectivity of RMO 1-2015, and those already issued Provisional ICC/BCC and will qualify for the issuance of ICC/BCC pursuant to RMO 33-2014, however, ARMD will no longer be sending the RFVs to all concerned offices. Instead, the applicant/taxpayer will directly go to your respective offices to secure the required certifications prescribed under RMO No. 1-2015.\n\nFor your guidance and strict compliance.\n\n(SGD.)

                                    "Details": "Records showed that as of December 31, 2013, the outstanding balance of the account \"Other Receivables\" (SL 149-002 \u2014 Dishonored Checks thru Banks) in the National Office (NO) National Government (NG) books of accounts amounted to over P430.86 million. This account pertains to the accumulated balances of Dishonored Checks (DCs) for the period 1987 to 2013 that are still appearing in the NO-NG books of accounts, the accuracy of which may be considered doubtful. It has been noted that some of these accounts were already redeemed by the concerned taxpayers but such redemptions are not yet reflected in the books of accounts being maintained by the Revenue Accounting Division (RAD) due to the absence of the requisite supporting documents such as BIR Form No. 12.61 (Report of Dishonored Checks Redeemed) and/or the settlement thereof could not be validated by the RAD from the ITS-Collection and Bank Reconciliation System (CBRS) because the manual issuance of Revenue Official Receipts (RORs) were not encoded by the concerned Revenue District Offices (RDOs). SDHTEC\n\nPursuant to the recommendation made by the Commission on Audit (COA)-Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) Resident Auditor, as contained in Audit Observation Memorandum (AOM) NG 2014-08 (2013) dated March 21, 2014, this Operations Memorandum is issued to implement the proper treatment of DCs in the Bureau's books of accounts and financial statements.\n\nThe following policies and guidelines must be observed by all concerned offices in handling delinquent accounts arising from DCs:\n\nA. Proper Treatment of Dishonored Checks Received and Redeemed\n\n1. All delinquent accounts arising from DCs received from the concerned Authorized Agent Banks (AABs) or Authorized Government Depository Banks (AGDBs) shall not be recorded in the NO-NG Books of account as \"Other Receivables\".All DCs received must be automatically considered as delinquent accounts and the same must be reflected \"New Cases Created\" in the General Control Ledger (GCL) required to be maintained by all concerned offices.\n\n2. All DCs received by the RDO from AABs and AGDBs must be encoded immediately in the \"Dishonored Checks\" module in the ITS-CBRS upon receipt of the said checks (Please refer to RMO No. 25-2001 dated October 16, 2001 and OM No. 2014-04-01 dated April 10, 2014).\n\n3. For RDOs where the Accounts Receivable Management System (ARMS) has already been deployed, all DCs must likewise be encoded in the \"Create Case\" module in the said system (Please refer to OM No. 2014-01-01 dated April 10, 2014).\n\n4. The outstanding DC cases being handled by the Regional Legal Divisions (RLDs) shall always form part of the inventory of unredeemed DCs that must be included in the AR/DA inventory per GCL until the same are fully settled by the concerned taxpayers. Furthermore, all outstanding DCs where the case dockets are physically located in other offices of the Bureau (e.g.,Regional Investigation Division, and other concerned legal offices in the NO, etc.) shall likewise form part of the GCL accounts required to be maintained by the concerned offices. In order to ensure the full accounting of these outstanding DCs that are needed to be reflected in the GCLs, the Regional Collection Divisions (RCDs) shall conduct thorough validation of their records to determine whether or not all concerned offices have fully complied with the reporting requirements set forth in this OM.\n\n5. Redemption of DCs must be reflected in the \"Cases Closed\" column of the GCL. However, in cases where additional penalties were collected, other than the penalties reflected in the \"New Cases Created\",the additional collections made due to updating of delinquency interests from DCs should not be included in the amount of \"Cases Closed\" column because this may only create distortions in the AR/DA amount in the GCL due to incorrect treatment of such additional payments as \"overpayments\" of the amount due from the taxpayer.\n\n6. All redemptions of DCs shall be considered as new tax collections of the Bureau; and the same shall be processed and recorded in the NO-NG books of accounts in accordance with the existing policies and procedures. In order to effectively monitor redemptions of DCs by all concerned offices of the Bureau, the provisions of Item No. 1 of OM No. 12-04-001 dated March 22, 2012 shall be strictly observed as follows: AScHCD\n\n\"xxx xxx xxx\n\nRequire the concerned taxpayers to use only BIR Form 0605 (Payment Form) in the course of the redemption of dishonored checks indicating the following:\n\na. Return period\n\nb. Tax type\n\nc. Delinquent account\n\nd. Amount in the settlement of their dishonored checks per RMO No. 25-2001.\n\nxxx xxx xxx\"\n\n7. Considering that the AR/DA inventory in the GCL are already net of the DCs redeemed, such redemptions shall not be separately disclosed in the Bureau's financial statements.\n\n8. All unredeemed DCs shall be considered as delinquent accounts and reported as such in the GCLs until these delinquent accounts are collected from the concerned taxpayers.\n\nB. Adjustment of \"Other Receivables\" (SL 149-002 \u2014 Dishonored Checks thru Banks) that are Already Recorded in the NO-NG Books of Accounts\n\n1. Other Receivables Recorded in the NO-NG Books of Accounts that are Already Reported in the GCL\n\n1.1. The RAD shall provide all RDOs and RCDs not later than December 29, 2014 with a List of Outstanding DCs in the NO-NG books of accounts as of June 30, 2014, copy furnished the Accounts Receivable Monitoring Division (ARMD).\n\n1.2. The RDOs shall submit, in return, to the RAD the inventory list of all DCs that are included in their respective GCLs as of June 30, 2014 duly certified correct by the Chief, RCDs, copy furnished the ARMD on or before December 29, 2014.\n\nFor Metro Manila regional offices with Arrears Management Teams (AMTs) the Chief, Collection Division shall submit to the RAD the Inventory List of DCs that are included in the GCL of RDOs under RR Nos. 5, 6, 7 and 8, except the Island RDOs under RR No. 6-Manila as of June 30, 2014, on or before December 29, 2014.\n\n1.3. The ARMD shall validate from the Master List of ARs/DAs maintained by its office whether or not the taxpayers reflected in the list of taxpayers with outstanding DCs are actually included in their respective GCLs. The validated list shall be submitted to RAD, copy furnished ACIR, Collection Service, on or before December 29, 2014.\n\n1.4. The RAD shall match the ARMD-validated list of outstanding DCs in the GCLs of concerned offices with the list of unredeemed DCs appearing in the account \"Other Receivables\" in the NO-NG books of accounts. Thereafter, the RAD shall prepare and approve the appropriate Journal Entry Vouchers (JEVs) to effect the necessary adjustments to the \"Other Receivables\" account in NO-NG books of accounts. AcICHD\n\n1.5. The ARMD shall require the concerned RDOs/RCDs to amend their respective GCLs in cases of existence of unredeemed DCs included in the submitted report mentioned in Item No. A.8 of this OM but not reflected in the GCLs originally submitted to the ARMD.\n\nThe concerned RDOs/RCDs shall prepare and submit to ARMD their amended GCLs within ten (10) days from receipt of such notification. For this purpose, the ARMD shall continuously monitor the compliance of the concerned RDOs/RCDs with this requirement.\n\n2. Other Receivables that are Already Redeemed but are still in the NO-NG Books of Accounts\n\n2.1. The RAD shall provide all RDOs and RCDs not later than December 29, 2014 with a List of Outstanding DCs in the NO-NG books of accounts as of June 30, 2014, copy furnished the ARMD.\n\n2.2. The RDOs/RCDs shall, in cases where the requisite documents evidencing the redemption of DCs are not physically available, request confirmation of DC redemption from the concerned taxpayers together with copies of the documents evidencing the settlement of these accounts.\n\n2.3. The RDOs/RCDs shall submit to the RAD pertinent documents relative to the redemptions of DCs such as Monthly Report of DCs Redeemed (BIR Form No. 12.61),together with the copies of the proofs of payments of these delinquent accounts.\n\nFor redemption of DCs thru Revenue Official Receipts (RORs),the certification by the Chief, Regional Finance Division (RFD) that the said collections were actually deposited to the concerned AGDBs, together with the certified photocopy/ies of the deposit slips, must be attached to the Monthly Report of DCs Redeemed (BIR Form No. 12.61) to be submitted to RAD.\n\n2.4. The RAD shall validate the accuracy and completeness of the submitted reports and supporting documents. Thereafter, the RAD shall prepare and approve JEV to record the redemption of the DCs. In case the submitted reports and documents are found to be inaccurate and/or incomplete, the RAD shall immediately inform in writing the concerned RDOs/RCDs of such observations or findings for their immediate necessary action within ten (10) days from receipt thereof.\n\n2.5. All the above-mentioned procedures must be made or undertaken by all the concerned offices until such time that the unredeemed DCs recorded in the NO-NG books of accounts shall have been fully settled by the delinquent taxpayers.\n\n3. Unredeemed DCs Recorded as Other Receivables in the NO-NG Books of Accounts but not Included in the GCL\n\n3.1. The RAD shall provide all RDOs and RCDs not later than December 29, 2014 with a List of Outstanding DCs in the NO-NG books of accounts as of June 30, 2014, copy furnished the ARMD. TAIaHE\n\n3.2. The RDOs/RCDs shall prepare and submit to the ARMD, copy furnished the RAD, not later than December 29, 2014, the amended GCLs to reflect the ARs/DAs not classified under Item Nos. B.1 and B.2 of this OM.\n\n3.3. The RAD shall coordinate with the ARMD to determine whether or not the concerned RDOs/RCDs have complied with the aforementioned requirement.\n\n3.4. The RAD shall prepare and approve the appropriate JEVs to effect the necessary adjustments to the \"Other Receivables\" account in NO-NG books of accounts.\n\n3.5. The RDOs/RCDs shall regularly monitor the outstanding DCs under this classification until these accounts are determined to have been fully redeemed and the prescribed reports and supporting documents thereon are submitted to RAD, copy furnished the ARMD.\n\n3.6. In case the outstanding DCs could no longer be collected from the concerned taxpayers despite diligent efforts exerted by the RDOs/RCDs and the said accounts will fall squarely within the definition of \"AR/DA for Write-off\" pursuant to Section II.5 of RMO No. 11-2014, the appropriate recommendation for the cancellation of these accounts from the GCL may be made pursuant to the policy provisions of the said RMO.\n\n3.7. Once these unredeemed DCs are included in the GCLs of the concerned offices, these outstanding delinquent accounts shall be included in the footnotes to the financial statements until the same are fully settled by the taxpayers or written-off from the GCL, pursuant to the provisions of RMO No. 11-2014.\n\nC. Filing of Criminal Charges against Delinquent Taxpayers\n\n1. In case the delinquent taxpayer failed to redeem any DC within five (5) days from receipt of the Notice of Dishonor from the concerned RDO, the enforcement of collection thru administrative summary remedies shall be strictly undertaken by the RDO. In case the taxpayer falls under the jurisdiction of a district office where there is an AMT in the Regional Collection Division (RCD),the case docket must be immediately transmitted by the district office to the latter immediately after the lapse of the said 5-day grace period for the conduct of necessary enforcement actions.\n\nIn case the concerned taxpayer failed to settle his delinquent account due to issuance of DC within the prescribed period, appropriate legal action must be immediately instituted against the said delinquent taxpayer by the RLD for violation of the Tax Code, and/or Batas Pambansa (BP) Blg. 22, otherwise known as the Anti-Bouncing Check Law, or Article 315 of the Revised Penal Code, as the case may be.\n\nNotwithstanding the referral of the case to the RLD, the concerned RDO or RCD must continue to undertake necessary enforcement actions thru summary remedies against delinquent taxpayers.\n\n2. Taxpayers who are determined to be habitual offenders shall likewise be subjected to immediate legal action. For this purpose, the concerned RDOs and RCDs must submit to the RLDs a list of taxpayers who are considered as habitual offenders of the said law, for the filing of the appropriate civil and criminal action due to violation of the Tax Code, BP Blg. 22, or Article 315 of the Revised Penal Code. cDHAES\n\nFor this purpose, a habitual offender refers to a person who makes or draws and issues any check to apply on its/his/her tax liability that is subsequently dishonored by the drawee-bank for insufficiency of funds or credit, or would have been dishonored for the same reason had not the drawer, without any valid reason, ordered the bank to stop payment, or issuance of check/s from closed account/s with a frequency of at least three (3) times. Likewise, a person who issues defective checks (e.g., stale checks, post-dated checks, etc.) with a frequency of at least three (3) times is also considered as habitual offender, and that criminal and civil liability must be filed immediately against him/her. Habitual offender shall, in addition to other penalties provided by law, upon conviction thereof, be punished by a fine not less than Ten Thousand Pesos (Php10,000) and suffer imprisonment of not less than 1 year but not more than ten (10) years.\n\nMoreover, for taxpayers who are not considered habitual offenders, the guidelines and procedures prescribed under Revenue Memorandum Order No. 25-2001 dated October 16, 2001 must be strictly observed by all the concerned offices with a reminder that only cash or cashier's/manager's check shall be accepted to redeem any dishonored check.\n\n3. The RLD shall immediately evaluate all the recommendations referred to by the RDO and the concerned RCDs. The concerned RDOs and RCDs shall be officially informed by the RLD of the results of the Evaluation within fifteen (15) days from receipt of the case docket.\n\n4. The RLD shall submit monthly status/progress reports on the cases referred for legal action and/or cases already filed in court to the concerned RDOs and RCDs, copy punished the Regional Director and Assistant Commissioner-Collection Service within fifteen (15) days of the following month.\n\n5. In order to forestall the continued incidences of DCs, the concerned taxpayers with recorded DC/s must be required by all the concerned RDOs to electronically file their respective tax returns and pay the taxes due thereon either thru the Bureau's Electronic Filing and Payment System (eFPS) or Electronic BIR Forms (eBIR Forms).\n\nIn cases where the aforesaid electronic facilities of the Bureau have been declared to be temporarily unavailable thru the advisory issued by the Information System Group (ISG),the payments of the taxes due by the concerned taxpayers shall only be made in \"cash\" or \"manager's checks\" or \"cashier's checks\" and not thru personal or company checks. cTDaEH\n\nStrict compliance herewith is hereby enjoined.\n\n(SGD.)

The ARMS was intended to provide assistance to offices and officials handling AR/DAs to accurately account their respective AR/DA inventory, monitor the actions taken on the AR/DA cases from the time these were created until the same are closed, track their movement from one office to another, and automatically generate the required reports thereon on a timely manner. Considering that the aforesaid system is still in the pilot stage and not yet deployed to all concerned offices nationwide, the manual accounting and tracking of the cases, as well as the preparation of the requisite reports related to AR/DAs could not be dispensed with. Under the present procedure of accounting and tracking AR/DAs, all concerned Offices handling AR/DAs are required to submit General Control Ledger (GCL) monthly, including updates on the AR/DAs. These reports are the source of information stored in the database of AR/DAs being maintained in excel file by the Accounts Receivable Monitoring Division (ARMD), formerly called Collection Enforcement Division (CED). Hence, the submission of inaccurate reports and/or non-submission/late submission of the prescribed reports by the concerned offices will result to distortions of the data in the AR/DA database being maintained by the said Office.\n\nIn view thereof, this Operations Memorandum is issued to:\n\n1.   Remind all Offices required to submit on time the GCL report and the Updates on Delinquent Accounts. Otherwise, administrative sanctions shall be imposed either for the habitual delays in the submission thereof or the non-submission of the aforesaid reports.\n\n2.   Reiterate the need for the submission of the GCL reports by Offices which are not directly involved in the collection of tax arrears, but have in their possession AR/DA case for whatever appropriate action such as resolution of factual or legal issues raised during the enforcement of collection proceedings, in order to provide an accurate and timely information to internal and external stakeholders on AR/DAs handled by the Bureau as of any given time. EcIDaA\n\n3.   Require every Office handling AR/DA cases to submit the GCL report, including updates of delinquent accounts, in hard and soft copies every 15th day following the close of the month, using the revised GCL format (Annex \"A\") and Updates on Delinquent Accounts (Annex \"B\"). In the event that during the given month, there is no movement in the AR/DA cases, the GCL report shall still be submitted, reflecting therein the same information as of the beginning and ending of the given month, with notation \"No updates during the month\".\n\nThe use of the revised formats shall start with the GCL report ending April, 2013, but for those Offices that have not yet submitted their reports for the month of March 2013 and prior months, the use of the revised formats is already required.\n\nStrict compliance herewith is hereby enjoined.\n\n(SGD.)

The beginning inventory shall be the ending inventory of the immediately preceding month.\n\n2.   In order to determine the number of Accounts Receivable/Delinquent Accounts (ARs/DAs) to be reflected in each of the sub-classification as to source of ARs/DAs, namely: 1) AR/DA arising from the issuance of Final Assessment Notice; 2) AR/DA arising from unpaid second installment; 3) AR/DA arising from unpaid dishonored check; and 4) AR/DA arising from unpaid tax due per return filed, it is necessary that prior evaluation be conducted in each of the AR/DA inventory on hand at the time of the preparation of the report. With regards to the age of the account, the guide for each type of AR according to source is as follows: HCaDIS\n\n2.1   For AR emanating from the issuance of Final Assessment Notice \u2014 the counting of age shall start after the lapse of thirty (30) days from the date of receipt of the FAN by the taxpayer, or in the absence of date of receipt, the date of mailing of FAN, or in the absence of the two dates, the date of FAN.\n\n2.2   For AR arising from unpaid second installment \u2014 the counting of the age of account shall be from the due date for the payment of the second installment of income tax.\n\n2.3   For AR arising from unpaid dishonored check \u2014 the counting of the age of the account shall start from the date when the check was returned by the bank to the concerned Revenue District Office.\n\n2.4   For AR arising from unpaid tax due per return \u2014 the counting of the age of the account shall start from the time of filing the return where such tax due was reflected.\n\n3.   Of the total ending inventory on hand as of the end of any given month, determine how many in each category and in each age group can be considered \"suspense AR\" and \"AR for write-off\". Detailed list of ARs considered \"suspense\" and \"for write-off\" must also be prepared with corresponding reasons for classifying them as either \"suspense\" or \"for write-off\". However, if the AR cases recommended for write-off have already been approved and subsequently issued Authority to Cancel Assessment (ATCA), the same shall be reflected under the credit column of the GCL.\n\nThe criteria for determining AR as \"suspense\" or \"for write-off\" are provided in a separate revenue issuance; thus, in the meantime that such revenue issuance is not yet approved, there shall be no figure to be reflected under the \"suspense\" or \"for write-off\" column of the GCL report.",

                                    "Details": "The Accounts Receivable Management System (ARMS) is a system of accounting and tracking Account Receivable/Delinquent Account (AR/DA) dockets from the date of their creation up to their closure. The system also provides modules for the generations of correspondences such as the Preliminary Collection Letter (PCL), Final Notice Before Seizure (FNBS), Tax Clearance and other correspondences, including generation of reports pertaining to AR/DA management, and the management of approved installment settlement. With this system, status and whereabouts of the AR/DA docket at any given time can be verified, provided, that timely updating has been done by the Case Officer handling the AR/DA.\n\nAR/DA may either arise from self-assessed tax such as unpaid second installment, unpaid tax due per return, and dishonored check or from the issuance of a final assessment notice as a result of audit or based on third-party information that was not protested by the taxpayer within the prescribed 30-day period. For AR/DA dockets emanating from self-assessed tax, encoding into the ARMS is the responsibility of the Collection Section of the concerned Revenue District Office (RDO), while for those arising from undisputed assessment where settlements of taxes have not been made within the time prescribed for their payment, the encoding of which, under existing revenue issuance, shall be the responsibility of the Assessment Division (AD).\n\nConsidering, however, that encoding into the ARMS of AR/DA dockets will require personnel complement, which, at present, is scarce at these concerned ADs, it is more convenient that a list of these AR/DA dockets arising from undisputed assessment shall be prepared in excel format and thereafter be uploaded to the ARMS by the Systems Development Division (SDD) under the Information System Development and Operation Service (ISDOS) of the Information Systems Group (ISG), using the prescribed format (Annex A). This format shall be adopted in lieu of the manually prepared Form 40 report. AacDHE\n\nPolicies and Guidelines\n\n1. In general, the AD/Large Taxpayers Service (LTS) shall forward AR/DA dockets to the Revenue District Office/Large Taxpayers Collection Enforcement Division (LTCED) for the enforcement of collection based on the following:\n\nThe AR/DA dockets transmitted to the concerned RDO/LTCED shall be covered by a transmittal list in hard and soft copies following the prescribed format (Annex \"A\"). Copies of the transmittal lists, in soft copies, must be forwarded to the SDD for uploading to the ARMS, through email at: angelita.mercado@bir.gov.ph and liberty.deguzman@bir.gov.ph or to an email address which shall later be created for this purpose only, copy furnished the Collection Enforcement Division (CED), for monitoring purposes. In view of the policy in the transmission of AR/DA dockets to the concerned RDO/LTCED, there could be more than one (1) transmittal list that shall be prepared within a given month; thus, the transmittal list must be serially-numbered following the format below:\n\nFor ADs under the jurisdiction of Revenue Region Nos. 5, 6, 7 and 8, the AR/DA dockets shall be directly forwarded to their respective Regional Collection Divisions (RCDs) also in accordance with the aforesaid policies.\n\n2. In the preparation of the list, the AD/LTS shall follow the guidelines attached to the aforesaid format in accomplishing the same. In determining the appropriate classification code to be indicated in the list, enumerated below are classification codes to choose from:\n\nWith regards to the transaction code and considering that the AR/DA dockets emanating from the AD/LTS are all covered by FANs that were issued manually, the transaction code to be indicated should be MLA which refers to \"manual assessment\". However, in the event that the FAN arises from the Returns Processing System, which is a system-generated FAN, the transaction code to be indicated should be SGA.\n\n3. The SDD shall upload into the ARMS the submitted lists by the AD/LTS, within two (2) days from receipt thereof, to the respective Offices as indicated in the transmittal list. For example, if it was indicated that the list of cases shall be uploaded to the Collection Division of Revenue Region No. 7, Quezon City, the name of the aforesaid Office must be indicated below the serial number of the transmittal list. This policy shall be applicable even if the Office to which the AR/DA dockets/cases shall be uploaded has no ARMS in place.\n\nIn case the delinquent account information was not successfully uploaded to the ARMS, SDD shall officially notify the concerned AD or LTS, as the case may be, of such fact and the possible reason for the failure, within the day the list was not uploaded successfully. The aforesaid notification shall be furnished to the CED for monitoring purposes.\n\nThe concerned AD or LTS shall rectify the file format to enable the successful uploading into the ARMS of the list, and shall re-submit the list within three (3) working days from receipt of the notification from SDD. SDHETI\n\nTo ensure the authenticity of the lists that shall be uploaded by the SDD to the ARMS, only lists received emanating from the official email address of the concerned Chief, Assessment Division or ACIR, LTS, as the case may be, shall be considered official. For this purpose, any transmittal list of created AR/DA dockets/cases originating from the respective email accounts shall be deemed authentic; hence, it shall be their responsibility that their email accounts are not shared with other persons.\n\n4. The RDO/RCD/LTCED, thru the Collection Section or the Receivable Account and Collection Enforcement Section (RACES), in the case of RDO and RCD, respectively, shall reconcile the pending task (number of AR/DA dockets for assignment) in the ARMS as against the physical inventory of AR/DA dockets forwarded by the AD/LTS. Any discrepancy must be reported at once to the AD/LTS, or to the SDD, whichever is appropriate. In case the number of AR/DA dockets appearing in the pending task is lower than the number of physical AR/DA docket count, the discrepancy must be referred to the SDD. However, if the physical AR/DA docket count is lower than the number of AR/DA dockets waiting to be acknowledged in the ARMS, the discrepancy must be referred to the AD/LTS.\n\nReconciliation to be done by the concerned RDOs/RCDs/LTCED shall not be limited to the physical count, but shall also cover the reconciliation of relevant information indicated in the transmittal list as against the source document attached in the AR/DA docket.\n\nIn case the ARMS is not yet deployed at the concerned RDOs/RCDs, the reconciliation of AR/DA docket inventory shall be based on the information listed in the transmittal list as against the information/source document attached in the AR/DA docket.\n\n5. The Case Officer/Seizure Agent (SA) to whom the AR/DA docket is assigned shall validate the information uploaded in the ARMS and thereafter modify the same, as the need arises. Subsequent actions on cases assigned to them must always be encoded into the system, including the subsequent transfer of docket to another SA or superior officials, if needed.\n\nThe submission of the list of AR/DA dockets using the attached prescribed format shall commence for the month of January, 2013, and shall remain to be used every month thereafter until such time that a revised facility of uploading of new AR/DA dockets into the ARMS is implemented.

The migration of the data stored in the ARCS 1 database shall be the responsibility of the Systems Maintenance and Support Division (SMSD). However, to ensure that the data in the existing ARCS database are fully migrated, the SMSD shall provide the CED with the list of all cases in soft copy, sorted as to the name of encoder and further classified as to the RDO or Office which has jurisdiction over the case. The list shall be used as basis of the CED in checking the completeness and accuracy of the migrated data, considering that CED can view all accounts receivable (AR) cases that were created under ARCS 1. cEaTHD\n\nAfter the migration process has been completed, the following are expected to be viewed through the MODIFY/INQUIRE DOCKET:\n\na. All the migrated cases are tagged as OLD;\n\nb. Docket Number (Format: RDO + YYYY + 00001);\n\nc. Docket Case Status are all tagged as OPEN;\n\nd. Correspondences (PCL, FNBS) have pre-populated information if the same are available in the migrated data;\n\ne. The Warrant of Distraint and/or Levy (WDL) button shall be enabled for encoding of WDL information; and\n\nf. The name of the person who encoded the case and their corresponding Office and Division based from ARCS 1 Application.\n\nPrior to the pilot roll out, there is a need to identify specific user/s that will access the enhanced system and validate the migrated data as to the accuracy of the information indicated therein, depending on the ACTUAL information of the docket. Only identified user/s shall be granted access to the system.\n\nOnce the system has been rolled-out to pilot sites, the following procedures shall be adopted:\n\nI. Handling of Migrated Data:\n\n1. When the physical docket is still in the concerned office:\n\na. Verify existence of the information in the docket on hand by accessing ARMS-ARDA-Inquire Docket and follow the illustrated process flow in Annex \"A\" hereof; DCcTHa\n\nb. Update or modify the information reflected, following the job aids provided for updating or modifying the case, to ensure the following:\n\ni. Registration information of taxpayers that were encoded on enhanced ARCS are matched with the information in the REG database (e.g., TIN, registered address, RDO, etc.).\n\nii. The TIN and Branch Code information are matched with the corresponding docket in the application.\n\niii. The ARCS docket contains information regarding the Tax Type, Assessment Number, Return Period, Date of Receipt by the Taxpayer of the Final Assessment Notice (FAN); the amount due per tax type; and Date Created on the old system.\n\niv. The ARCS docket case contains the classification codes and the transaction type and other list of values to map the correct codes to the enhanced ARCS.\n\nIf the TIN of the taxpayer is found to be \"ceased\" or \"deceased\", meaning not \"active\", the concerned Revenue Officer shall take note of this case and put appropriate remarks on the space provided.\n\nc. Indicate the automatically created Docket Number to the physical docket at the upper right corner of the docket using a permanent marker; and on the attached \"Conversion Input Form\" (CIF) (Annex \"B\"). All the documents that form part of the docket are required to be fastened in a folder. DHCcST\n\nd. Update/add information regarding settlement, payment or cancellation of accounts following the illustrated process flow in Annex \"C\" hereof.\n\n2. When the case's physical docket is no longer with the concerned office, check records on file to verify the status of the case:\n\na. Status is \"OPEN\"\n\ni. If the case is still open and the case was already transferred to another office, transfer-out the case to the particular office. (see Annex \"D\" for the process flow image).\n\nii. If the particular office is one of the pilot sites, it shall acknowledge receipt of the cases. (Please refer to Annex \"E\" for the process flow image for acknowledging docket) After acknowledging, the office to where the case was transferred shall follow procedures under 1.1 hereof for updating the case's status.\n\niii. If the Office to which the case was transferred is not among the aforesaid pilot sites, the case shall be transferred-out using ARDA-Modify Docket (Docket Activity Tab \u2014 Annex \"D) given the following details:\n\nThese cases shall later on be transferred by the concerned office under the Information Systems Group based on the recommendation of the CED. HICATc\n\niv. The mass transfer using migration script shall be made prior to the nationwide roll-out of the ARMS. The Offices where these cases shall be transferred shall be responsible for updating the cases' status upon the nationwide roll-out of the ARMS.\n\nb. Status is \"CLOSED\"\n\ni. If the case's status is \"closed\" due to payment, encode the details of payment thru the \"PAYMENT/CLOSURE DETAILS\" (see Annex \"F\"). However, before encoding the payment, validate the same from the Collection and Bank Reconciliation (CBR) system of the Integrated Tax System (ITS) to ensure accuracy thereof.\n\nii. If the case's status is \"closed\" due to an approved Authority to Cancel Assessment (ATCA), encode the reference number and other details being required from the approved ATCA form. The following are instances when ATCA is required:\n\n1. The case was closed due to the approval of the application for abatement or compromise by the Commissioner, National Evaluation Board, or the Regional Evaluation Board, as the case may be;\n\n2. The case was closed due to a final and executory decision by the competent Court or by the Legal Group declaring the delinquent account (DA) as uncollectible due to prescription. However, the corresponding ATCAs for prescribed cases shall only be issued by the ACIR, Legal Service pursuant to Revenue Delegation Authority (RDAO) No. 6-2001; ASDTEa\n\n3. The issued FAN was determined to be \"null and void\" after satisfying the conditions provided in Revenue Regulations No. 12-99.\n\n4. The taxpayer availed of the Tax Amnesty and the same was found to be valid.\n\niii. If the case's status is \"closed\" per existing record due to circumstances stated under 2 (b) (ii) hereof, but there is no record that an ATCA has been prepared, the ATCA must be prepared and the same must be approved by the authorized BIR official in accordance with the existing rules and regulations. The particular case can only be closed after the approval of the ATCA and after encoding the required ATCA details in AR database. However, it is incumbent to the recommending officer to validate if the case is qualified for the issuance of ATCA.\n\nc. If the case's status or whereabouts of the docket can no longer be determined from the existing records:\n\nPrepare a list of these cases and submit the same to their respective Regional Collection Division (CD), in the case of RDOs; Large Taxpayers Collection Enforcement Division (LTCED), in the case of LT Regular Audit Divisions (LTRAD) 1 to 3 and LT Excise Audit Divisions (LTEAD) 1 and 2; Office of the ACIR-LTS in the case of Large Taxpayers Division Office (LTDO-Makati); CED in the case of all other concerned Offices in the National Office, other than LTRAD and LTEAD, for verification with their existing records. Thereafter, CD/LTCED/Office of ACIR-LTS/CED shall verify from their existing records the status of the case. If they are in possession of the docket, follow the procedures under Item 1.1 hereof. If the docket is not in their possession, but the case is still open and the docket's whereabouts can be determined based on existing records, follow the procedures under Item 2 (a) hereof. EADSIa\n\ni. In all cases that needs updating, the concerned Office must update the information in the ARMS, provided that the same is supported with necessary documents.\n\nii. Validation of old ARDA cases (migrated data from ARCS) must end not later than December 31, 2012.\n\niii. All concerned Offices must continue to submit the required manually-prepared General Control Ledger (GCL) report and the supporting schedules thereof during the pilot roll-out.\n\niv. It shall be the responsibility of the Office of the ACIR-Collection Service. ACIR-Large Taxpayers Service, ACIR-Legal Service, ACIR-Enforcement Service, Regional Director, Regional Collection Division, and Collection Enforcement Division to ensure that cases under their respective jurisdiction are fully validated.\n\nII. Handling of Validated Old ARDA Cases/Old ARDA Cases But Not Yet in the ARMS Database/New ARDA Cases:\n\n1. All validated old cases still pending with the concerned Office must be acted upon following the existing procedures prescribed for the enforcement of collection remedies, if applicable. Otherwise, the needed action (e.g., resolution of legal issues, evaluation of application for compromise settlement or abatement, etc.) for the particular case must be made. It is important to note that any actions taken on the case must be encoded by the concerned Revenue Officer in ARMS.\n\n2. For old cases which are not listed as pending in their respective jurisdiction, but are in reality still pending with them, encode the necessary information being required by the system through the \"add\" facility of the ARCS after accomplishing the revised CIF (Annex \"B\"). EAHDac\n\n3. Newly created accounts receivable cases received by the concerned Office during the pilot rollout of the ARCS must be added in the accounts receivable database using the \"add\" facility.\n\nIII. Handling of ARMS Issue Escalation and Resolution:\n\n1. All problems and inconsistencies of the system's behaviour from the expected output must be immediately recorded and reported to the BIR HelpDesk.\n\n2. The Helpdesk must elevate the issues to the Systems Maintenance Support Division (SMSD), which shall subsequently refer the issues and problems to the project contractor for resolution within the prescribed time as indicated in the Service Level Agreement (SLA).\n\nIV. Pilot Implementation Project Reporting:\n\nTo ensure the smooth implementation of the ARMS, a weekly meeting shall be held at the Office of the Assistant Commissioner, Collection Service. During the said meeting, issues and problems elevated must be resolved and the status of validation of migrated ARDA cases must be reported. The Notice of Meeting shall be prepared by the Chief, Collection Enforcement Division.\n\nIt should be noted that the foregoing transitory procedures shall be followed by the concerned pilot sites until such time that an amendatory OM has been issued.\n\nStrict compliance herewith is hereby enjoined.\n\n(SGD.)

Relative to this, the Collection Service and the Collection Programs Division have been receiving numerous requests from eDST users for the reprinting of documentary stamps which were not electronically affixed to the taxable documents.\n\nAs a policy, the eDST user can print the documentary stamp on the taxable document only once. Should the printer fail to print the said stamp to the taxable document under meritorious circumstances, there is a need for the eDST User to request the concerned BIR Office to reprint the documentary stamp thereat. Since the function of the reprinting of documentary stamp tax will be delegated to the concerned audit divisions under the Large Taxpayer Service (LTS), Large Taxpayer District Offices (LTDO), Revenue District Offices (RDOs) and other offices who are directly involved in the use of the eDST System, these offices will be provided with a printer exclusively for eDST reprinting purposes.\n\nThe General Services Division shall be in-charge for the distribution of the printers to the offices listed in Annex \"A\" hereof. Printers must be installed in the Revenue District Officer's Personal Computer and the same shall be used exclusively for the reprinting of the documentary stamps and other transactions pertaining to the eDST System. For this purpose and in order to ensure that those printers are only used for eDST reprinting, the Revenue Data Center will be responsible for their reconfigurations prior to the installation thereof at the concerned revenue offices. Prior to such installations, all RDOs and concerned Chiefs of Offices should furnish the Collection Programs Division (CPD) with the names of the designated revenue officials to whom such printers will be officially assigned within ten (10) days upon receipt of this Operations Memorandum. IcHDCS\n\nIn order to equip the concerned personnel with the technical knowledge on eDST System, including the reprinting of the documentary stamps and other functionalities thereof prior to the devolution of some of the eDST System functions to the concerned audit divisions of LTS, LTDOs and RDOs, the pertinent Revenue Memorandum Order shall be issued for this purpose and the appropriate trainings shall be conducted by the CPD, in coordination with the Training Delivery Division.\n\nFor your guidance and strict compliance.\n\n(SGD.)
