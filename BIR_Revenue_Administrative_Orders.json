Background\n\nIn the past, there were Regional Directors and Revenue District Officers who claimed that they could not generate the expected collections in their districts in spite of the robust economic activities particularly in certain islands which have become tourist haven. It was so because of the difficulties encountered by our taxpayers in these islands in complying with their tax obligations. Moreover, the absence of BIR men in these areas to closely monitor taxpayers' activities and serve promptly their needs was also a big factor. Thus through the initiative of said officials, these sub-offices existed in these islands without proper documentation and formal establishment.\n\nII. Objectives\n\nThis Order is being issued to:\n\n1. Establish formally the BIR Sub-Offices in the islands of Boracay and Camiguin.\n\n2. Prescribe the functions of the sub-office.\n\n3. Serve better/address promptly the tax compliance needs/concerns of taxpayers and businesses in the said islands.\n\nIII.

                                    "Details": "Background\n\nChapter 2, Book VII of Executive Order No. 292, the \"Administrative Code of 1987\" pertinently provides:\n\n\"SEC. 3. Filing. \u2014 (1) Every agency shall file with the University of the Philippines Law Center three (3) certified copies of every rule adopted by it. Rules in force on the date of effectivity of this code which are not filed within three (3) months from that date shall not thereafter be the basis of any sanction against any party or persons.\n\n(2) The records officer of the agency, or his equivalent functionary, shall carry out the requirements of this section under pain of disciplinary action.\n\n(3) A permanent register of all rules shall be kept by the issuing agency and shall be open to public inspection.\"\n\nAs provided above, every rule adopted by an agency shall be filed with the University of the Philippines Law Center (hereinafter referred to as the \"Center\"). SETaHC\n\nThe term \"rule\" mentioned above is defined in Section (2) (2), Chapter 1 of the said Code as follows:\n\n\"Rule\" means any agency statement of general applicability that implements or interprets a law, fixes and describes the procedures in, or practice requirements of, an agency, including its regulations. The term includes memoranda or statements concerning the internal administration or management of an agency not affecting the rights of, or procedure available to, the public.\"\n\nFrom the foregoing definition, there are two categories of rule, namely:\n\n1. Any agency statement of general applicability that implements or interprets a law, fixes and describes the procedures in, or practice requirements of, an agency, including its regulations.\n\n2. Memoranda or statements concerning the internal administration or management of an agency not affecting the rights of, or procedure available to, the public.\n\nThis Revenue Administrative Order is issued to identify the revenue issuances that are required to be filed with the Center based on the definition of rule in the said Code.\n\nSECTION 1. Classification/Description of Revenue Issuances. \u2014 Aside from Revenue Regulations, which are issued by the Secretary of Finance upon recommendation of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, under Revenue Administrative Order No. 1-2003, the revenue rulings and issuances that implement or interpret tax laws are classified and described as follows:\n\na) Rulings of first impression. \u2014 These refer to the rulings, opinions and interpretations of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue with respect to the provisions of the Tax Code and other tax laws without established precedent, and which are issued in response to a specific request for ruling filed by a taxpayer with the Bureau of Internal Revenue. Provided, however, that the term shall include reversal, modification or revocation of any existing ruling. CEIHcT\n\nb) Rulings with established precedents. \u2014 These refer to mere reiteration of previous rulings, opinions and interpretations of the Commissioner, which may be delegated by the Commissioner from time to time at his/her sole discretion to duly authorized internal revenue officers (i.e., Deputy Commissioner, Legal and Inspection Group; Assistant Commissioner, Legal Service; Regional Directors) that are issued in response to a specific request for ruling filed by a taxpayer with the Bureau of Internal Revenue.\n\nc) Revenue Memorandum Rulings (RMR). \u2014 These refer to the rulings, opinions and interpretations of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue with respect to the provisions of the Tax Code and other tax laws, as applied to a specific set of facts with or without established precedents, and which the Commissioner may issue from time to time for the purpose of providing taxpayers guidance on the tax consequences in specific situations.\n\nd) Revenue Bulletins (RB). \u2014 These refer to periodic issuances, notices and official announcements of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue that consolidate the Bureau of Internal Revenue's position on certain specific issues of law or administration in relation to the provisions of the Tax Code, relevant tax laws and other issuances for the guidance of the public.\n\ne) Revenue Travel Assignment Orders (RTAO). \u2014 These orders assign revenue personnel to specific functions in specific units. Travel assignment orders specifically mention the names of revenue personnel concerned.\n\nf) Revenue Special Orders (RSO). \u2014 Instructions or directives for the accomplishment of special assignments or missions of significance which are temporary in nature or for a definite period of time. These issuances specifically mention the personnel or units of organization concerned.\n\ng) Revenue Memorandum Circulars (RMC). \u2014 These issuances shall disseminate and embody pertinent and applicable portions, as well as amplifications of the rules, precedents, laws, regulations, opinions and other orders and directives issued by or administered by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, and by offices and agencies other than the Bureau of Internal Revenue, for the information, guidance or compliance of revenue personnel. TSHIDa\n\nh) Revenue Memorandum Orders (RMO). \u2014 These are directives or instructions outlining procedures, techniques, methods, processes, operations, activities, work flow, and the like, which are necessary to carry out programs or to achieve policy goals and objectives. These issuances may be of general or of limited scope yet in any case require definite compliance by those concerned. They are not addressed to any particular group of employees or offices because they are for general information, but those directly concerned with the compliance of these provisions are either definitely stated, or unmistakably implied thereat.\n\ni) Revenue Audit Memorandum Orders (RAMO). \u2014 These refer to the uniform audit procedures to be observed by revenue officers in the conduct of audit of tax cases and in their submission of reports of investigation.\n\nj) Revenue Delegation of Authority Orders (RDAO). \u2014 These refer to the functions delegated by the Commissioner to revenue officers in accordance with law.\n\nk) Revenue Administrative Orders (RAO). \u2014 These refer to matters that deal strictly with more or less permanent administrative set-up of the Bureau. Delineation of organizational structures, statements of functions and/or responsibilities, definitions and delegations of authority, staffing and personnel requirements, standards of performance, establishment of Bureau-wide programs, installation of system, and the like, are most likely subject matter of Revenue Administrative Orders. These issuances are for general guidance, compliance and/or information.\n\nSECTION 2. Revenue Issuances Required to be Filed with the Center. \u2014 The following revenue issuances are required to be filed with the Center:\n\na) Revenue Regulations are required to be filed since they implement the provisions of the Tax Code and other tax laws.\n\nb) Revenue Memorandum Rulings are required to be filed since they are interpretations of the provisions of the Tax Code and other tax laws which are of general applicability.\n\nc) Revenue Memorandum Orders which fix and describe the procedures in, or practice requirements of, the Bureau to be observed by the public are required to be filed since they are of general applicability. DTcHaA\n\nd) Revenue Memorandum Circulars which clarify or amplify rules, precedents, laws, regulations and other orders issued by the Commissioner are required to be filed if they are of general applicability.\n\ne) Revenue Bulletins are required to be filed since they are issued for the guidance of the public, hence, of general applicability.\n\nSECTION 3. Revenue Issuances Not Required to be Filed with the Center. \u2014 The following revenue issuances are not required to be filed with the Center:\n\na) Rulings, whether of first impression or with established precedents, are not required to be filed since they are issued in response to a specific request of a particular taxpayer which are not of general applicability.\n\nb) Revenue Memorandum Orders which fix and describe the procedures in, and practice requirements of, the Bureau to be observed by Bureau personnel only are not required to be filed since they are not of general applicability.\n\nc) Revenue Memorandum Circulars which disseminate various information to Bureau personnel for their guidance and compliance are not required to be filed since they are not of general applicability.\n\nd) Revenue Audit Memorandum Orders are not required to be filed since they prescribe the procedures to be observed by revenue officers in the conduct of audit of tax cases which are not of general applicability.\n\ne) Revenue Travel Assignment Orders and Revenue Special Orders are not required to be filed since they are directed to bureau personnel which are not of general applicability.\n\nf) Revenue Delegation Authority Orders and Revenue Administrative Orders refer to the functions delegated by the Commissioner to revenue officers in accordance with law and to matters that deal strictly with more or less permanent administrative set up of the Bureau, respectively. They are not required to be filed since they are not of general applicability, their observance and compliance are confined only to revenue officers and employees.\n\nSECTION 4. In case of doubt on whether a revenue issuance should be filed with the Center, the Chief, Records Management Division, who is tasked to undertake the filing, shall seek the opinion of the Deputy Commissioner, Legal and Inspection Group.\n\nSECTION 5. Effectivity. \u2014 This Revenue Administrative Order shall take effect immediately. cHCaIE\n\n(SGD.) KIM S. JACINTO-HENARES\nCommissioner of Internal Revenue",

                                    "Details": "STATEMENT OF POLICY :\n\nIt is the recognized policy under this Order that the power to interpret the provisions of the Tax Code of 1997 (Tax Code) and other tax laws is under the exclusive and original jurisdiction of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, subject to review by the Secretary of Finance, as provided for in Section 4 of the Tax Code.\n\nThe Bureau of Internal Revenue is under the supervision and control of the Department of Finance as provided for in Section 2 of the Tax Code and Book IV, Title II, Chapter 4, Section 18 of the Administrative Code of 1987.\n\nThere is a need for uniformity of rulings and issuances in the interpretation and application of the provisions of the Tax Code and other tax laws.\n\nSECTION 1. Scope. \u2014 This Revenue Administrative Order (RAO) shall, in general, apply to all revenue rulings and issuances of the Bureau of Internal Revenue that pertain to the implementation of the provisions of the Tax Code and other tax laws, and shall include the following:\n\na) Rulings of first impressions;\n\nb) Rulings with established precedents;\n\nc) Revenue Memorandum Rulings (RMR)\n\nd) Revenue Bulletins (RB)\n\ne) Revenue Travel Assignment Order (RTAO)\n\nf) Revenue Special Order (RSO)\n\ng) Revenue Memorandum Circular (RMC)\n\nh) Revenue Memorandum Order (RMO)\n\ni) Revenue Audit Memorandum Order (RAMO)\n\nj) Revenue Delegation of Authority Order (RDAO); and\n\nk) Revenue Administrative Order (RAO)\n\nSECTION 2. Review Power of the Secretary of Finance. \u2014 In accordance with Section 4 of the Tax Code, the Secretary of Finance shall have the power to affirm, revise, modify or set aside rulings and issuances of the Bureau of the Internal Revenue concerning the implementation and application of the provisions of the Tax Code and other tax laws.\n\nSECTION 3. Classification of BIR Rulings and Issuances. \u2014 The following terms shall have the meaning described below:\n\na) Rulings of first impression \u2014 These refer to the rulings, opinions and interpretations of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue with respect to the provisions of the Tax Code and other tax laws without established precedent, and which are issued in response to a specific request for ruling filed by a taxpayer with the Bureau of Internal Revenue. Provided, however, that the term shall include reversal, modification or revocation of any existing ruling.\n\nb) Rulings with established precedents \u2014 These refer to mere reiteration of previous rulings, opinions and interpretations of the Commissioner, as delegated to duly authorized internal revenue officers (i.e., Deputy Commissioner, Legal and Inspection Group; Assistant Commissioner, Legal Service; Regional Directors) that are issued in response to a specific request for ruling filed by a taxpayer with the Bureau of Internal Revenue. ASDTEa\n\nc) Revenue Memorandum Rulings (RMR) \u2014 These refer to the rulings, opinions and interpretations of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue with respect to the provisions of the Tax Code and other tax laws, as applied to a specific set of facts, with or without established precedents, and which the Commissioner may issue from time to time for the purpose of providing taxpayers guidance on the tax consequences in specific situations.\n\nd) Revenue Bulletins (RB) \u2014 These refer to periodic issuances, notices and official announcements of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue that consolidate the Bureau of Internal Revenue's position on certain specific issues of law or administration in relation to the provisions of the Tax Code, relevant tax laws and other issuances for the guidance of the public.\n\ne) Revenue Travel Assignment Orders (RTAO) \u2014 These orders assign revenue personnel to specific functions in specific units. Travel assignment orders specifically mention the names of revenue personnel concerned.\n\nf) Revenue Special Orders (RSO) \u2014 Instructions or directives for the accomplishment of special assignments or missions of significance which are temporary in nature or for a definite period of time. These issuances specifically mention the personnel or units of organization concerned.\n\ng) Revenue Memorandum Circulars (RMC) \u2014 These issuances shall disseminate and embody pertinent and applicable portions, as well as amplifications of the rules, precedents, laws, regulations, opinions and other orders and directives issued by or administered by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, and by offices and agencies other than the Bureau of Internal Revenue, for the information, guidance or compliance of revenue personnel.\n\nh) Revenue Memorandum Orders (RMO) \u2014 These are directives or instructions outlining procedures, techniques, methods, processes, operations, activities, work flow, and the like, which are necessary to carry out programs or to achieve policy goals and objectives. These issuances may be of general or of limited scope yet in any case require definite compliance by those concerned. They are not addressed to any particular group of employees or offices because they are for general information, but those directly concerned with the compliance of these provisions are either definitely stated, or unmistakably implied thereat.\n\ni) Revenue Audit Memorandum Orders (RAMO) \u2014 These refer to the uniform audit procedures to be observed by revenue officers in the conduct of audit of tax cases and in their submission of reports of investigation.\n\nj) Revenue Delegation of Authority Orders (RDAO) \u2014 These refer to the functions delegated by the Commissioner to revenue officers in accordance with law.\n\nk) Revenue Administrative Orders (RAO) \u2014 These refer to matters that deal strictly with more or less permanent administrative set-up of the Bureau. Delineation of organizational structures, statements of functions and/or responsibilities, definitions and delegations of authority, staffing and personnel requirements, standards of performance, establishment of Bureau-wide programs, installation of systems, and the like, are most likely subject matter of Revenue Administrative Orders. These issuances are for general guidance, compliance and/or information.\n\nSECTION 4. Validity of Rulings and Issuances. \u2014 All rulings and issuances of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue that pertain to the implementation and interpretation of the Tax Code and other tax laws are valid, unless revoked, reversed, modified, or superseded by the Secretary of Finance pursuant to Department Order No. 23-01.\n\nSECTION 5. Effectivity. \u2014 This Revenue Administrative Order shall take effect immediately.\n\n(SGD.) GUILLERMO L. PARAYNO, JR.\nCommissioner of Internal Revenue",

                                    "Details": "I. OBJECTIVES\n\nTo identify the responsibilities of revenue officers and to provide for the procedure for the proper implementation of the first paragraph of Section 4 of the Tax Code of 1997, as implemented by Department Order No. 23-01, that vests in the Secretary of Finance the power to review the interpretation of the Tax Code and other tax laws by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue.\n\nTo provide for the certification fees to be paid to the Bureau of Internal Revenue by the taxpayers seeking review of rulings that interpret the provisions of the Tax Code and other tax laws.\n\nII. SCOPE\n\nThis Revenue Administrative Order (RAO) covers rulings issued by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (Commissioner) and by officers (delegatee/s) with duly delegated powers to issue rulings on behalf of the Commissioner under pertinent issuances such as, but not limited to the Commissioner's Memoranda dated June 21, 2000 and October 26, 2000; Revenue Memorandum Order (RMO) No. 75-99; Revenue Memorandum Circular (RMC) No. 10-2001, RMC Nos. 3-2001 and 2-2001, as supplemented by RMC No. 14-2001; and, RMC No. 39-2001.\n\nParticularly, these rulings refer to those issued by the Commissioner, or by his Deputy Commissioner for Legal and Inspection Group, Assistant Commissioner for Legal Service, or by the Regional Directors, as may be appropriate.\n\nThis RAO does not cover, however, disputed assessments, refunds of internal revenue taxes, fees or other charges, and penalties imposed in relation thereto, or other matters arising under the Tax Code or other laws or portions thereof administered by the Bureau of Internal Revenue. In these instances, the Court of Tax Appeals has the exclusive appellate jurisdiction pursuant to the second paragraph of the same Section 4 of the Tax Code of 1997.\n\nNeither shall this RAO apply to rulings that are deemed void ab initio because they contradict duly issued Revenue Regulations, Revenue Memorandum Orders, Revenue Memorandum Rulings, and Revenue Memorandum Circulars.\n\nIII. PROCEDURE\n\n1. Within thirty (30) days from the date of receipt of the adverse ruling of the Commissioner, the affected taxpayer may seek the review of the ruling by the Department of Finance. In all cases, the adverse ruling that can be brought to the Department of Finance shall only be the final adverse decision of the Commissioner.\n\nIn the case of rulings by the Commissioner's delegatees, the taxpayer shall exhaust administrative remedies within the Bureau of Internal Revenue by filing a letter of reconsideration addressed to the Commissioner, but filed with the Office of the Assistant Commissioner for Legal Service (ACIR-LS) in the case of adverse rulings decided by the Revenue Regional Directors or with the Office of the Deputy Commissioner of Internal Revenue for Legal and Inspection Group (DCIR-LIG) in the case of adverse rulings decided by the ACIR-LS within fifteen (15) days from receipt of an adverse ruling, before requesting for a review by the Secretary of Finance;\n\n2. File with the Office of the Commissioner, for endorsement to the ACIR-LS, a copy of the request for review of the Ruling;\n\n3. Request from the ACIR-LS for an authenticated and certified true copy of the complete docket or records on file.\n\n4. Pay the certification fee to the authorized agent bank having jurisdiction over the taxpayer or the place of business of the taxpayer, using Payment Form 0605;\n\n5. Present to the ACIR-LS the original copy of the official receipt that evidences payment of the certification fee, and submit a photocopy thereof to form part of the docket or records of the case;\n\n6. Within five (5) days from the date of payment of the certification fee, the ACIR-LS shall instruct the Division Chief of the Law Division or the International Tax Affairs Division, as the case may be, for each and every page of the records of the case, sequentially numbered, to be photocopied, including a copy of the subject BIR Ruling, and for the complete set to be stamped and signed by the concerned Division Chief to be an authentic and true copy of the original and complete records on file. In the case of rulings made by the Revenue Regional Directors and finally decided by the Commissioner to be adverse to the taxpayer, the ACIR-LS shall certify and authenticate the duplicate copy of the records of the case;\n\n7. The appropriate office shall also prepare the endorsement letter of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (Annex \"A\"), which letter shall be signed by the Assistant Commissioner for Legal Service, who is hereby designated as the Commissioner's duly authorized representative. In this regard, the ACIR-LS shall submit to the Commissioner, copy furnished the ODCIR-LIG, a monthly report of cases appealed and certifications made;\n\n8. The authenticated and certified true copy of the docket or records of the case, including the endorsement thereof to the Secretary of Finance, through the Revenue Operations Group, shall be released to the holder of the original copy of the official receipt evidencing payment of the certification fee. EIDTAa\n\nIV. TAXPAYER'S REQUEST FOR REVIEW BY THE SECRETARY OF FINANCE\n\nA taxpayer who receives an adverse ruling from the Commissioner of Internal Revenue may, within thirty (30) days from the date of receipt of such ruling, seek its review by the Secretary of Finance, either by himself/itself or through his/its duly accredited tax agent or representative. The request for review shall be in writing and under oath, and must:\n\na) be addressed to the Secretary of Finance and filed with the Revenue Operations Group, Department of Finance, DOF Building, BSP Complex, Roxas Boulevard corner Pablo Ocampo Street, City of Manila;\n\nb) contain the heading \"Request for Review of BIR Ruling No. ______\":\n\nc) allege and show that the request was filed within the reglementary period;\n\nd) allege the material facts upon which the ruling was requested;\n\ne) state that exactly the same set of facts were presented to the BIR;\n\nf) define the issues to be resolved;\n\ng) contain the facts and the law relied upon to dispute the ruling of the Commissioner;\n\nh) be signed by or on behalf of the taxpayer filing the request for review, provided that, only those lawyers engaged by the taxpayer and/or tax agents accredited by the BIR may sign on behalf of the taxpayer;\n\ni) indicate the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) of the taxpayer,\n\nj) be accompanied by a copy of the Commissioner's challenged ruling;\n\nk) contain a statement of the Office of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, indicating that a copy of the request for review of the ruling was received by the Commissioner's Office and;\n\ni) specifically state that the taxpayer does not have a pending assessment or case in any court of justice where the same issues are being considered.\n\nFurthermore, the taxpayer must, at the time of filing of the request for review, submit a duplicate copy of the records on file with the BIR pertaining to his request, which set of records must be authenticated and certified by the BIR.\n\nV. CERTIFICATION FEE\n\nFor this purpose, the requesting taxpayer shall pay a certification fee in the amount of ten pesos (P10.00) for every page of the complete records on file that shall be reproduced and certified to be a true and authentic copy thereof.\n\nAny and all amounts paid as certification fee are non-refundable and shall be forfeited in case the taxpayer finally decides not to seek a review by the Secretary of Finance.\n\nVI. EFFECTIVITY CLAUSE\n\nThis Order shall take effect immediately.\n\n(SGD.) RENE G. BA\u00d1EZ\nCommissioner of Internal Revenue",

Review Power of the Secretary of Finance \u2014 In accordance with Section 4 of the Tax Code, the Secretary of Finance shall have the power to affirm, revise, modify or set aside rulings and issuances of the Bureau of the Internal Revenue concerning the implementation and application of the provisions of the Tax Code and other tax laws.\n\nSECTION 3. Classification of BIR Rulings and Issuances \u2014 The following terms shall have the meaning described below:\n\na) Rulings of first impression \u2014 These refer to the rulings, opinions and interpretations of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue with respect to the provisions of the Tax Code and other tax laws without established precedent, and which are issued in response to a specific request for ruling filed by a taxpayer with the Bureau of Internal Revenue. Provided, however, that the term shall include reversal, modification or revocation of any existing ruling.\n\nb) Rulings with established precedents \u2014 These refer to mere reiteration of previous rulings, opinions and interpretations of the Commissioner, as delegated to duly authorized internal revenue officers (i.e., Deputy Commissioner, Legal and Inspection Group; Assistant Commissioner, Legal Service; Regional Directors) that are issued in response to a specific request for ruling filed by a taxpayer with the Bureau of Internal Revenue.\n\nc) Revenue Memorandum Rulings (RMR) \u2014 These refer to the rulings, opinions and interpretations of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue with respect to the provisions of the Tax Code and other tax laws, as applied to a specific set of facts, with or without established precedents, and which the Commissioner may issue from time to time for the purpose of providing taxpayers guidance on the tax consequences in specific situations.\n\nd) Revenue Travel Assignment Orders (RTAO) \u2014 These orders assign revenue personnel to specific functions in specific units. Travel assignment orders specifically mention the names of revenue personnel concerned.\n\ne) Revenue Special Orders (RSO) \u2014 Instructions or directives for the accomplishment of special assignments or missions of significance which are temporary in nature or for a definite period of time.

These issuances may be of general or of limited scope yet in any case require definite compliance by those concerned. They are not addressed to any particular group of employees or offices because they are for general information, but those directly concerned with the compliance of these provisions are either definitely stated, or unmistakably implied thereat.\n\nh) Revenue Audit Memorandum Orders (RAMO) \u2014 These refer to the uniform audit procedures to be observed by revenue officers in the conduct of audit of tax cases and in their submission of reports of investigation.\n\ni) Revenue Delegation of Authority Orders (RDAO) \u2014 These refer to the functions delegated by the Commissioner to revenue officers in accordance with law.\n\nj) Revenue Administrative Orders (RAO) \u2014 These refer to matters that deal strictly with more or less permanent administrative set-up of the Bureau.

Provide a more accurate and scientific basis for classifying Revenue District Offices. cdtai\n\nII. FEATURES:\n\nThe features of the revised classification of Revenue Districts are as follows:\n\n1. The factors on which the new classification is based are revenue collection, number of taxfilers, labor force and land area.\n\n2. The latest available data for all factors considered were used in this reclassification.\n\n3. There are five (5) classes of districts under this classification - A-1, A, B, C and D.\n\nIII. METHODOLOGY:\n\nTo determine the class of each Revenue District Office, the four factors considered were given weights of 60% for revenue collection, 20% for the number of filers; and 10% each for labor force and land area. These weights were applied to the ratio of contribution of each RDO per variable. In equation form: cdt\n\nThe resulting Class Indicator (the value derived from the given formula) of the Revenue District Offices were arranged from highest to lowest to determine the class limits (the upper and the lower values of the class intervals). Due to the big gaps of the computed Class Indicators between Revenue District Offices, equal class intervals (the range or the width of the value in a class) were not used. Instead, classes were so constructed so as to have the concentration of the Revenue District Offices in the middle classes as shown on the table below: cdt\n\nDISTRIBUTION OF REVENUE DISTRICTS BY CLASS\n\nThe set of districts under the new classification scheme are shown on Appendix A.\n\nIV. UPDATING CLASSIFICATION OF RDOs\n\nThe classification of Revenue District Offices shall be updated once every five (5) years. cd\n\nV.

The Field Operations Divisions has jurisdiction over all establishments dealing in articles subject to excise taxes and fees, except those located in Metro Manila up to Apalit, Pampanga in the North and Calamba, Laguna in the South. Some of these establishments at the same time maintain principal offices and bonded warehouses in Metro Manila and, therefore, not within its competence. The Field Operations Division, in the discharge of its duties, more particularly in the conduct of spot checking and stocktaking, however, may require the simultaneous investigation of the records and stocks of their branches or warehouses whereby overlapping of functions becomes inevitable. The same holds true with the other divisions. Establishments under their respective jurisdictions might have branches or bonded terminals in the provinces which are outside of their territorial jurisdictions. cd i\n\nLikewise, in the issuance of permits, the different divisions issue permits to establishments located within their territorial jurisdictions, however, such establishments may have branches located in other provinces beyond the competence of the division having jurisdiction over the principal establishment.\n\nThese and other conflicts spawned confusion among the personnel of the different divisions concerned.\n\nIn order, therefore, to synchronize the functions of the divisions under the Specific Tax Office and to ensure effective implementation of the laws and regulations affecting excise taxes as well as maintain a sole counter-checking body to oversee the operations of establishments under the jurisdiction of the Specific Tax Office, it is imperative that the functions of the respective divisions be amended in accordance with this Order. casia\n\nOBJECTIVE:\n\nThe Field Operations Division shall have the exclusive authority to conduct audit and investigation, spot checking, counter checking and stocktaking of all establishments engaged in the importation of cigarette paper, leaf tobacco and production of articles subject to excise taxes and fees, while the other divisions under the Specific Tax Office shall, in addition to its functions under Revenue Administrative Order No. 2-84, exercise the functions of the Field Operations Division over establishments located in all revenue regions, except those stated in the foregoing. cd\n\nORGANIZATIONAL SET UP OF THE DIVISION\n\nThe Division shall be headed by a Chief of Division and two (2) Assistant Chiefs, with the following Sections, namely:\n\n1. Investigation, Stocktaking and Spot Checking Section;\n\n2. Audit and Review Section; and\n\n3. Research, Analysis and Records Section.\n\nEach Section shall be headed by a Chief of Section and any additional personnel of the Division shall be drawn from the other divisions. Personnel of the Specific Tax Regional Teams shall remain in their respective posts and shall be supervised by the Chief, Specific Tax Regional Team and/or Officers-in-Charge. All reports required of them to be submitted shall be forwarded to the respective divisions concerned.\n\nFUNCTIONS:\n\nThe Field Operations Division shall exclusively exercise the following functions:\n\n1. Conducts investigation of cases involving reported violations of excise tax laws and regulations and/or non-payment of excise taxes or tobacco inspection fees;\n\n2. Conducts spot checking, surveillance and detection with the end view to apprehend manufacturers, importers and dealers of taxable products and raw materials on the basis of confidential information. aisa dc\n\n3. Conducts regular stocktaking or inventory of raw materials and finished products of establishments subject to excise taxes or as often as the Commissioner may require;\n\n4. Supervises the disposition or disposal of tobacco and cigarette paper wastes as often as the establishments may request;\n\n5. Conducts audit or verification of reports submitted by manufacturers, importers or wholesalers or articles subject to excise taxes, including manufacturers, importers and dealers of leaf tobacco; casia\n\n6. Maintains a file or records of taxpayers audited and/or investigated for reference and data bank purposes;\n\n7. Develops and recommends policies and work programs for an efficient and effective administration of excise taxes and tobacco inspection fees under the jurisdiction of the Division;\n\n8. Collates and compiles statistical reports on establishments with respect to raw materials used in the manufacture of articles subject to excise taxes; and\n\n9.

Scope of Work.\n\n(a) Jurisdictional amounts and nature of income covered:\n\nThe Office Audit Section shall examine individual income and business returns, which have been classified for office audit in accordance with the following:\n\n(b) Limitation on investigative authority.\n\nRevenue District Officers, Asst. Rev. District Officers, Chiefs and Asst. Chiefs of Branches, as well as other officers occupying similar positions or designations are directed to desist from personally conducting an examination and/or investigation of tax returns, except in the following cases: cda\n\n(a) When his expertise in view of the particular nature of the business is necessary or indispensable, provided he is assisted by an Enforcement Officer assigned in his Office.

A \"No discrepancy\" statement on the report form itself in applicable cases would be sufficient.\n\nIn all instances, however, the review of field audit reports of investigation covered by Letter of Authority should be given priority.

No. 30 Quezon City to North and South Districts under Revenue Administrative Order No. 3-84 dated January 29, 1984. cd i\n\nAn examination of the attached map showing the division will readily give the impression that setting up the demarcation line between North and South at \"Quezon Blvd. from the boundary of Manila towards the National Office, right at EDSA and then left at Aurora Blvd. at the Rotonda Cubao up to the boundary of Marikina\" has resulted in giving to the North District an area almost six times larger than the area alloted to the South District. (Please refer to the attached map: The present set-up in the map shows that the areas colored blue, orange, and yellow comprises the North District while only the green portion comprises the South District).\n\nOne other indication that there is an inequitable division of Quezon City District in the present set-up is that there are 72 barangays within the jurisdiction of North District while only 31 barangays are within the areas alloted to South District.\n\nWe do not know nor understand what criteria was used in the division but we are sure that the division was meant to divide Quezon City equitably into two equal areas of jurisdiction under RDO Abat and the undersigned. We believe that it was never intended to make North Quezon City a major district will relegating South Quezon City into a minor district.\n\nMay we, also, bring to the attention of the Commissioner problems that the above division has unwittingly created: aisa dc\n\n1. It had always been the policy of the Bureau to make payment of taxes as convenient as possible to the taxpayers but it seems that this was not taken into serious consideration by the Committee that proposed the division. Taxpayers keep asking and complaining how confusing it is for them to find out with which district to deal with, considering that instead of having only demarcation line so that tax collection would be simple, the division has created multiple conflicts of jurisdiction as follows: firstly, demarcation line along Quezon Blvd.; secondly, demarcation line along EDSA; and thirdly, demarcation line along Aurora Blvd., Cubao up to the boundary of Marikina.\n\n2. As it is now, even our personnel have a hard time pinpointing which establishment is under South or North, resulting in delays in tax enforcement and problems in tax collection.\n\n3. Please note also that while South District was given a very small area compared to the North District, the Region expects us to accomplish equal collection goals. Under the present arrangement, how can South District equal much less exceed the collections of North District when the North District covers a wider area with bigger establishments mostly factories? aisa dc\n\nTo correct the present imbalance, may we respectfully suggest the setting up of a new boundary line between North and South.\n\nWe present two alternative proposals:\n\nFirst Proposal (indicated as Plan 2, 1st Proposal on the map)\n\nTo designate as boundary line Quezon Blvd. from the border of Manila up to the National Office and straight to the Don Mariano Marcos Avenue up to the boundary of San Mateo, the coverage indicated on the map as follows:\n\nNorth District \u2014 all areas colored orange and blue; and\n\nSouth District \u2014 all areas colored green and yellow.\n\nSecond Proposal (indicated as Plan 3, 2nd Proposal on the map)\n\nTo designate as boundary line EDSA from the boundary of Caloocan up to the Aurora Blvd. Rotonda then left at Aurora Blvd. up to the boundary of Marikina, the coverage indicated on the map as follows:\n\nNorth District \u2014 all areas colored orange and yellow; and\n\nSouth District \u2014 all areas colored blue and green.\n\nWe believe that either on the above proposals will substantially correct the present imbalance and we, therefore, respectfully recommend their consideration. casia\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nFRANCIS R.

All areas located north of this boundary represent the investigative jurisdiction of North Quezon City. North Quezon City revenue district has been pushed to the northern most part of the business area of Quezon City or to the \"brim\" so to speak.\n\nCOMMENTS\n\nThe two revenue districts have been in operation for only eight (8) months so that we have no statistical basis to anchor the allegation that there is an inequitable distribution of workload in the collection of internal revenue taxes. However, beginning the month of July, 1984, the two (2) district offices have managed to prepare a total segregation and independent collection reports on voluntary compliance, which are as follows: cdtai\n\nIt can be gleaned from the above figures that the two (2) districts, as they are now relatively have the same collection potentials. On the other hand this redivision will certainly create an inequitable distribution of workload in the collection of internal revenue taxes because of the following reasons;\n\n1. All the business areas will be taken over by South Quezon City (Revenue District 30-A) except a few small trading establishments located at the left side of EDSA (facing South) and the left side of Aurora Boulevard (facing east) up to the boundary of Marikina.\n\n2. The other places allocated to North Quezon City will be the undeveloped areas along EDSA from Caloocan; Novaliches, likewise an undeveloped area where our two collection personnel issue an average of 359 Payment Orders a month involving an average collection of P909,893.30; Bago Bantay, Bagong Pagasa, Project 8, the government area around the Quezon Memorial Circle; Diliman District, UP Village; Loyola Heights; Quirino District; Xavierville and Balara District; all residential areas and subdivisions designed for low income employees and three memorial parks, as follows: cdt\n\n1. GSIS Village\n\n2. Congressional Village\n\n3. Project 8\n\n4. Project 2\n\n5. Project 3\n\n6. Project 4\n\n7. Carmel Village\n\n8. St. Dominic Subdivision\n\n9. Pilar Village\n\n10. Pleasant View Subdivision\n\n11. Green Park Subdivision\n\n12. Real Village\n\n13. Paradise Village\n\n14. Maligaya Village\n\n15. Jordan Village\n\n16. Pugad Lawin\n\n17. Professional Village\n\n18. Amparo Village\n\n19. Tierra Pura Subdivision\n\n20. Tierra Bella Subdivision\n\n21. Perpetual Village\n\n22. Kalaw Village\n\n23. Intramuros Village\n\n24. Capitol Bliss\n\n25. Fil Invest\n\n26. Don Antonio\n\n27. Do\u00f1a Manuela\n\n28. Sunville Village\n\n29. Banco Filipino\n\n30. Sikatuna Village\n\n31. Gloria I Subdivision\n\n32. Gloria II Subdivision\n\n33. Magno Subdivision\n\n34. Memorial park \u2014 Eternal Garden\n\n35. Memorial park \u2014 Himlayang Pilipino\n\n36. Memorial park \u2014 Holy Cross Park\n\nThe resident of these subdivisions are mostly employees working in the commercial centers of Metro Manila whose income taxes have already been withheld by their respective employers and remitted to the Revenue District Offices of their place of employment. This is the reason why there are more barangays as claimed under the jurisdiction of North Quezon City than that of South Quezon City district. cda\n\n3. The redivision of Quezon City under this Revenue Administrative Order has reduced North Quezon City (Revenue District 30) to a very small area with minimal tax potential which to my mind will not justify its creation as revenue district within Metro Manila area because it cannot even qualify as a Class \"C\" revenue district.\n\nWhile it is true that the land area covered by Quezon City North is bigger than Quezon City South, the greater portion represents the undeveloped places and residential areas where most of the low-cost subdivision are located as aforestated. On the other hand, all the areas allocated to South Quezon City are all developed areas where most of the business establishments are located.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThis Revenue District has a personnel strength of \u2014\n\n2 Assistant Revenue District Officers\n\n10 Group Supervisors\n\n49 Revenue Examiners\n\n18 Supportive Personnel\n\n25 Collection Personnel\n\ndesigned to staff a Class A-1 Revenue District Office. Under this new redivision which reduces my District to a very small one which, as I have stated earlier, cannot even qualify as Class \"C\" Revenue District, a re-assignment of personnel will pose another problem because to retain all of them without sufficient work to be done by each will be a waste of much needed manhours in our frantic efforts to collect more taxes. aisa dc\n\nI humbly feel also that this will constitute a clear demotion on my part. In all my previous assignments, I had performed well. While in Laguna (1973-78) as Revenue District Officer I was among the top ten RDO's all over the country. In 1982 as RDO of Makati I was again rated among the top ten RDOs. In all my 32 years of service in BIR, modesty aside, my record is clean.\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nIn view of all the foregoing facts, and in order to correct any inequity in the division of Quezon City, if any, I respectfully recommend that the 1st proposal of Revenue District Officer Guzman in the redivision of Quezon City contained in his letter to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue dated May 22, 1984 be given due course which reads as follows:\n\n\"First Proposal \u2014 To designate a boundary line Quezon Boulevard from the border of Manila up to the National Office and straight to Don Mariano Marcos Avenue up to the boundary of San Mateo, the coverage indicated on the map as follows: cdtai\n\n\"North District \u2014 all areas colored orange and blue; and\n\n\"South District \u2014 all areas colored green and yellow.\"\n\nThis is his No. 1 proposal and I believe he will have no objection to it.\n\nIn view of all the foregoing, I hope top management will see its way clear in the judicious redivision of Quezon City.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) QUINTIN ABAT\nRevenue District Officer\nTAN-1002-289-5",

Provide a more accurate and scientific basis for classifying Revenue District Offices.\n\nII. FEATURES:\n\nThe features of the revised classification of Revenue Districts are as follows:\n\n1. The factors on which the new classification is based are revenue collection, number of tax filers, labor force and land area. The two additional factors of labor force and land area were considered to measure the potential of the districts. It is hypothesized that a district with a greater labor force and larger land area has greater potential to generate more revenue than one with lesser labor force and/or smaller land area.\n\n2. The latest available data for all factors considered were used in this reclassification. cdasia\n\n3. There are five (5) classes of districts under the revised classification - A-1, A, B, C, and D.\n\nIII. METHODOLOGY:\n\nTo determine the class of each Revenue District Office, the four factors considered were given weights of 60% for revenue collection, 20% for the number of filers; and 10% each for labor force and land area. These weights were applied to the ratio of contribution of each RDO per variable. In equation form: cd\n\nThe resulting Class Indicator (the value derived from the computation using the given formula) of the Revenue District Offices were arranged from highest to lowest to determine the class limits (the upper and lower values of the class intervals). Due to the big gaps of the computed Class Indicators between Revenue District Offices, equal class intervals (the range or the width of the value in a class) were not used. Instead, classes were so constructed so as to have the concentration of the Revenue District Offices in the middle classes as shown on the table below:\n\nDISTRIBUTION OF REVENUE DISTRICTS BY CLASS\n\nhe set of districts under the new classification scheme are shown on Appendix A. cd i\n\nIV. UPDATING OF CLASSIFICATION OF RDOs\n\nThe classification of Revenue Districts Offices shall be updated once every five (5) years.\n\nV.  REPEALING CLAUSE:\n\nThis order revokes or repeals all existing regulations or orders which are inconsistent herewith. cd i\n\nVI. EFFECTIVITY:\n\nThis Order takes effect upon approval.\n\nRUBEN B.

This arrangement, however, will not apply to cases being handled by National Office lawyers in Revenue Regions Nos. 4-A and 4-B.\n\nHowever, in policy and complicated cases, to be determined by the Revenue Service Chief (Legal), National Office lawyers may continue to handle the prosecution thereof until they have rested the case; after which, the same may be relinquished to lawyers of the Region concerned.\n\nII.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE\n\nOne of the on-going projects of the BIR is the establishment of an Integrated Computerized Management Information System designed to provide much needed data to be used in its operations, management and decision making processes, The system is expected to generate information that may lead to among others, the early detection of tax evaders and non-filers of returns, identify taxpayers underdeclaring their income or overstating their expenses, simplify revenue projections techniques, rationalize goal allocations to the field offices, monitor tax investigations and personnel performance and facilitate collection control and reporting.\n\nA major step towards the attainment of an effective MIS is to decentralize the data entry operations with limited computer capability at the regional level. This is aimed at bringing the computing power closer to the end-user in order to: cdasia\n\n1. Insure the availability of timely and accurate computer processible data at the Central computing facility at the DPC; and\n\n2.  Enable the regional offices to service their own operational and information requirements.\n\nII. ORGANIZATION\n\nTo attain the above cited objectives, there is hereby created two (2) Regional Data Centers, one in Revenue Region No. 4-B, Quezon City and the other in Revenue Region No. 4-A, Manila. Other Regional Data Centers shall be created in the remaining Regional Offices on a staggered basis depending on the success and effectiveness of the two (2) initial Data Centers and the availability of funds for this purpose.\n\nIII. FUNCTIONS\n\nThe Regional Data Centers shall be placed under the Office of the Regional Director. It shall have the following functions and responsibilities.\n\n1. Batch, screen and code income tax returns and other source documents received within the Region preparatory to data capture;\n\n2. Transcribe data from the source documents into computer machine readable language;\n\n3. Prepare batch listings of punched data for verification purposes; cd\n\n4. Verify erroneously punched data against source documents and correct the same;\n\n5. Prepare alphabetical listings of income tax filers and other reports out of the processed documents for use by the Regional Office;\n\n6. Send magnetic tape copies of transcribed data/information to the DPC at Central Office for further processing and consolidation into the master file;\n\n7. Perform other related functions or activities as may be assigned by the Regional Director or the DPC in the Central Office.\n\nIV. PERSONNEL COMPLEMENT\n\nThe Data Processing Center shall provide the initial staff of the Data Centers from among its current personnel since the Revenue Regions concerned do not have the appropriate items for this purpose. It shall likewise undertake the recruitment and training of newly hired personnel for assignment to the Centers. Subsequently, the Revenue Regions shall be responsible for recruiting additional employees in its Data Centers and shall see to it that the needed items and funds for supplies and forms are included in their Budget proposals every fiscal year.\n\nVI. REPEALING CLAUSE\n\nThis Order revokes or modifies previous issuances or portions thereof which are inconsistent with the provisions of this Order. aisa dc\n\nVI.

DISPUTED ASSESSMENTS\n\nA. In General. \u2014 Subject to the continuing general supervision of the Revenue Service Chief, Legal Office:\n\n1. If a taxpayer disagrees with the assessment of any tax covered by the National Internal Revenue Code, or any other tax laws or regulations administered and enforced by the Bureau of Internal Revenue, or requests for reconsideration of deficiency assessments involving P500,000 and above, the Revenue Service Chief (Legal Office) may refer the case to the Appellate Conference Staff provided the taxpayer complies with the following:\n\na) The taxpayer shall specify in writing his objection or objections thereto and the basis thereof, item by item, if possible.\n\nb) The taxpayer shall execute a waiver of the statute of limitations upon assessment and collection of taxes prescribed by the National Internal Revenue Code and other tax laws administered by the Bureau of Internal Revenue.\n\n2.

This procedure shall be followed in the investigation and reporting of income and business tax returns which are subject to office audit. cda\n\nI. Purpose \u2014\n\nThe purpose of the creation of an Office Audit Section in the Assessment Branch of every Revenue Regional Office is to have a unit that would assist in the processing of tax returns and take charge of the investigation of small cases whose tax potential is not commensurate with the time and efforts exerted and costs incurred in a field investigation. Such cases may very well be settled by correspondence or office interview and at the same time can become an effective vehicle for the Bureau's tax information and education program.\n\nII. Organizational Set-Up \u2014\n\nThe Office Audit Section shall be under the direct supervision and control of the Chief, Assessment Branch of the Regional Office. It shall be headed by a Chief of Section, to be assisted by an Assistant Chief of Section and such other officials that would be needed to effectively run the Section. It shall be composed of examiners divided into groups of at least eight but not more than ten examiners, with group supervisor in-charge of each group. Whenever possible, the necessary clerical support shall be given each group. The group supervisor shall be selected from among the most ranking examiners in the Section, taking into consideration their educational qualification, experience, technical knowledge and training.\n\nIII. Territorial Limits \u2014\n\nIn order not to cause inconvenience and unnecessary expense for transportation on the part of taxpayers, office audit investigation shall be limited only to the towns and cities indicated opposite each Revenue Regional Office as follows:\n\nHowever, when circumstances so warrant, the Regional Director may recommend to the Commissioner the extension of the territorial limits of office audit investigation in his Revenue Region.\n\nIV. Scope of Work \u2014\n\nThe Section shall examine individual income and business tax returns which have been classified for office audit in accordance with the following:\n\nV. Reclassification of Returns \u2014\n\nIf the classification of returns as presented in Paragraph IV would result in too many returns for office audit and disproportionately less number of returns for field audit, depending on the number of examiners to perform each function, the Regional Director is given the discretion to readjust the classification of returns to equitably apportion the returns between the field and office audit examiners. Such readjustment shall, however, be subject to the approval of the Commissioner. cdta\n\nVI. Transmittal and Sorting of Returns \u2014\n\nThe Chief of the Assessment Branch shall periodically transmit office audit returns, subject to the approval of the Regional Director, to the Chief of the Office Audit Section. Upon receipt of the returns, the same shall be sorted into the following categories:\n\nA. Correspondence cases \u2014 Under this classification will fall the simple cases which can be settled by correspondence, like those requiring additional information on one or two items and which the taxpayers may provide by correspondence. Those returns segregated during the pre-audit of \"Reviewed Returns\" because the exemptions and/or some deductions claimed need to be explained or supported shall also come under this classification.\n\nB. Interview cases \u2014 These are the returns of taxpayers engaged in small businesses or in a limited practice of profession which necessitates the audit of their books of accounts and other supporting papers in the verification of their tax liabilities.\n\nVII. Procedure of Investigation \u2014\n\nA. Correspondence Cases \u2014\n\n1. Mathematical Verification \u2014 Since the returns have not been pre-audited, (except the returns classified as \"Reviewed\") all the returns selected as correspondence cases should first be verified for mathematical accuracy.\n\n2. Audit and Classification Check Sheet \u2014 The Assistant Chief of the Section, who may be assisted by the group supervisors, shall accomplish for each return classified as a correspondence case, an Audit and Classification Check Sheet (Annex \"A\") indicating the form letter to be used, as well as the items which need clarification, further information, explanation, or verification.\n\n3. Assignment \u2014 The returns with their respective Check Sheets shall then be arranged in numerical order on the basis of their assessment numbers and divided among the group supervisors or examiners in case there are no supervisors. The Chief of the Section shall see to it that as much as possible, an equal number of cases is assigned to each group or examiner.\n\n4. Survey Cases \u2014 The group supervisor shall go over the returns and if in his opinion further communication with the taxpayer is not necessary, the case may be closed as a \"survey before assignment\" case. The Survey Report (Annex \"B\") shall be accomplished and the reason or reasons for recommending that the case be closed on survey should be briefly but clearly stated.\n\n5. Preparation of Correspondence and Examination Record Card \u2014 As soon as the returns are ready for office audit, the following shall be prepared immediately:\n\n(1) the Form Letter (Annex \"C\") prepared in triplicate enumerating therein the information or documents indicated in the Audit and Classification Check Sheet; and\n\n(2) the Examination Record Card (Annex \"D\") \u2014\n\nAfter both the Form Letter and the Examination Record Card have been properly accomplished, the group supervisor shall schedule the letters to be released each day.\n\nThe letters which are not yet to be released shall be maintained in a strictly alphabetical file with the complete set of the Examination Record Card attached to each return.\n\nThe cases with the letters for release shall be processed in the following manner:\n\na. Examination Record Card\n\nA card (original) to Assessment Branch for its control file.\n\nB card (duplicate) to the General Index Alpha File of the Office Audit Section\n\nC card (triplicate) to the Group Supervisor's file\n\nD card (quadruplicate) to be retained with the case file\n\nb. Correspondence\n\nAfter the group supervisor has checked the correctness of the letter, the complete case file shall be forwarded through the usual channels, to the Assistant Regional Director for signature. Due to the volume of these cases, the Assistant Director, may, however, designate the Chief or the Assistant Chief of the Assessment Branch or the Chief or Assistant Chief of the Office Audit Section to sign the same for him or in his behalf. After signature, the case file shall be returned to the Group Supervisor, who shall send the originals of the letters to taxpayers to the Administrative Branch for mailing. The duplicate shall be filed by the dates of the letters and the triplicates shall remain attached to the case files.\n\nThe duplicates of letters released on a single date shall be kept in one folder by each group supervisor and forwarded with the second notice (Annex \"E\") for signature in the same manner that the original correspondence was processed. The second notice shall be prepared in triplicate and sent fifteen (15) days after the date the reply to the first letter was expected.\n\nThe same procedure shall be followed with respect to the third or final notice (Annex \"F\"). The final notice shall likewise be prepared in triplicate and sent ten (10) days after the date set in the second notice.\n\nThe triplicate copies of the second and final notices should also be attached to the case file.\n\n6. Processing of Replies. \u2014 All replies to letters released under this procedure shall be screened by the Group Supervisor and segregated into three groups:\n\na. Those that will not affect the tax liability as shown in the return. \u2014 The return and all copies of the correspondence and the examination record cards, shall be stamped \"NO CHANGE\" and initialed by the Group Supervisor and Chief of Section. The letter (Annex \"G\") informing the taxpayer of the results of the office audit of his return shall be prepared, attached to the case file and forwarded for review and processing to the Chief, Assessment Branch. The same shall be forwarded to the Assistant Regional Director for approval and signature. After the letter is signed the file shall be returned to the Assessment Branch, where the examination record card will be completed and detached from the case file. The Assessment Branch shall also indicate in their control card the final disposition of every case, keeping a separate file for closed cases. The disposition of each card shall be made in accordance with the instructions on the use of the Examination Record Card set forth in Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 22-64. The case file shall then be forwarded to the Administrative Branch for release of the original of the letter informing the taxpayer of the result of the investigation of his return. The case file shall then be processed as a closed case.\n\nb. Those that will involve adjustment and result in a deficiency assessment \u2014 The case shall be referred to the examiners for the preparation of the audit sheet stating clearly therein the basis for the deficiency assessment. The case file shall then be processed in the same manner outlined in sub-paragraph a above. The case shall, however, not be considered closed until the deficiency tax is paid.\n\nc. Those cases which cannot be closed and may have to be converted into an interview case or where another set of correspondence is necessary \u2014 In either case, the procedure outlined for such cases shall be followed.\n\n7. Where no Replies are Received \u2014 Thirty (30) days after the final notice has been sent and no reply is received, efforts should be exerted to contact the taxpayer by telephone whenever possible.\n\nIf inspite of telephone follow-ups the taxpayer has not responded, or where the taxpayer cannot be contacted thru the telephone, the procedure prescribed for the same situation under Section VII paragraph B-8 of this Revenue Administrative Order shall be followed.\n\nB. Interview Cases \u2014\n\n1. Sorting \u2014 The Chief of the Office Audit Section shall sort the returns into:\n\na. returns with purely salary, dividend and other fixed or determinable income.\n\nb. returns with purely professional income.\n\nc. returns with purely business income. \u2014\n\n(1) Segregate the returns of those subject to percentage taxes from those whose businesses are subject only to the graduated fixed tax.\n\n(2) When a taxpayer is subject to percentage taxes, the Group Supervisor shall immediately requisition the percentage tax returns from the Assessment Branch.\n\nd. Returns showing only gains or losses from sales or exchanges of shares of stocks or gains and losses from sales or exchanges of capital assets and property other than capital assets. cd\n\ne. Returns showing income from Schedule 1 and/or 6 and anyone or more than one of Schedules 2, 3 and 5.\n\n2. The returns shall be equitably divided among the groups, taking care that each group, as much as possible, shall receive equal number of returns of each of the above mentioned categories.\n\n3. Preparation of Office Audit Classification Check Sheets \u2014 Upon receipt by the Supervisor of the returns allotted to his group, he shall go over them one by one and shall attach to each return an audit classification check sheet (Annex \"A\") indicating therein the items to be verified and examined. He may be assisted by the experienced and knowledgeable examiners in his group.\n\n4. Survey Cases \u2014 The procedure on correspondence cases shall apply to interview cases which may be closed as a \"survey before assignment\" case.\n\n5. Preparation of Correspondence and Examination Record Card. \u2014\n\na. The Examination Record Card and the appropriate form letter (Annex \"H\") shall then be prepared in accordance with the instructions in the Audit Classification Check Sheet.\n\nb. The letter and the Examination Record Card prepared shall then be processed in the same manner as correspondence cases. The letter attached to the return, shall be forwarded to the Assistant Regional Director for signature thru the regular channels. For a more systematic processing of these cases, the returns with the letters shall be forwarded for signature in batches of twenty cases per batch. Every batch shall be accompanied by a transmittal sheet indicating therein the name of the taxpayer, the assessment number and the name of the supervisor. After the letter is released, the Group Supervisor shall arrange the same files in alphabetical sequence. Care should be taken by the Supervisor so that only enough letters would be released for any one appointment date that his group can attend to without keeping many taxpayers waiting. A reasonable number should be given as an allowance for those who cannot make the appointment on the date set. Previous experience on the matter should be the guide in deciding on the number of letters to be released for a single appointment date.\n\nThe second notice (Annex \"I\") shall be sent fifteen (15) days after the appointment date and the third notice (Annex \"J\") five (5) days after the appointment date set in the second notice.\n\n6. Assignment of Cases. \u2014 The cases shall be assigned to the examiner when the taxpayer comes in with his records. As much as possible, the case should be settled in one interview. If on any day all the examiners in the group are busy with a taxpayer and other taxpayers are waiting, the Group Supervisor may conduct the interview. Since the returns of taxpayers engaged in the business falling under the jurisdiction of the Office Audit Section are limited to those with gross sales or receipts of not more than P100,000.00 IN THE CASE OF CLASS A REGIONS AND P50,000.00 IN THE CASE OF CLASS B REGIONS, only one examiner may be assigned to verify both income and business taxes as an exception to Revenue Memorandum Order No. 57-75.\n\n7. Where the taxpayer does not appear \u2014 Where the taxpayer does not appear after three letters have been sent, the taxpayer should be contacted by telephone whenever possible.\n\n8. Where follow-up by telephone calls have not produced any result or where taxpayers have no listed telephone numbers, examiners in the Office Audit Section may personally call on the taxpayers in accordance with the following procedure:\n\na. Every Group Supervisor shall prepare a list of taxpayers who have not responded to the third or final notice and telephone follow-ups to the Chief, Office Audit Section every month. The list shall indicate the address indicated on the return as well as other possible addresses where taxpayers may be contacted, like the place of employment, business address, etc.\n\nb. For a more systematic follow-up, the Chief, Office Audit Section shall collate the lists submitted by the Supervisors, grouping together taxpayers whose addresses are contiguous or are within the same block or district. He shall assign the list of taxpayers to the Group Supervisor, by district or sections of the town or city. The Group Supervisors shall in turn assign examiners who shall call on the taxpayers by blocks or by streets as he thinks would produce the best results.\n\nc. The Group Supervisor shall submit a daily schedule of the examiners in his group authorized to make personal call-ups. Personal call-ups shall be scheduled only during the afternoons. At least half of the members of the group shall always be in the office with either the supervisor or the Assistant Supervisor to attend to taxpayers who may come in response to letters sent to them.\n\nd. An itinerary of each examiner should be submitted on the form provided for the purpose, Annex \"M\".\n\ne. In order to prevent unauthorized personal contacts with taxpayers, the examiner shall be issued an Authorization For Personal Follow Up (Annex \"K\") when he checks on taxpayers who have not responded to notices sent to them.\n\nf. The examiner shall render a weekly report on the personal call-ups made by him on the attached form, Annex \"N\". This report shall be rendered in duplicate, the original to be compiled by the Chief, Office Audit Section and the duplicate shall be kept on file by the Supervisors. The Chief of the Section shall evaluate these reports, for the purpose of determining further action on these cases.\n\ng. The examiner shall personally contact only taxpayers who were assigned to him by his Group Supervisor.\n\nh. The examiner shall never conduct an investigation in the taxpayer's premises, unless authorized by the Regional Director (See paragraph VII B 10). He may however, receive the books of accounts and other records for purposes of office audit. In such cases an Acknowledgment Receipt (Annex \"L\" \u2014 BIR Form 19.14) for said records should be issued to the taxpayer.\n\ni. Where the taxpayers have transferred from the addresses stated on the return and their new addresses cannot be determined by the examiner after referring to all available records in the office, and after consulting the new occupants or neighbors in the stated address, the examiner shall make a report to his Supervisor stating therein the efforts he exerted and the records he referred to, to locate the subject taxpayer. The Supervisor shall then forward the report to the Chief, Office Audit Section. Whenever practical and if in the judgment of the Chief, Office Audit Section, additional efforts to locate the taxpayer is warranted, he may assign an examiner to refer to the records of the Data Processing Center, the City Hall, or the Municipal Treasurer, or the Bureau of Immigration, or other entities where a taxpayer's present address may be found. The Chief, Office Audit Section shall see to it that the personnel assigned for locating taxpayers with new or fictitious addresses, render daily itineraries in the form marked as Annex \"O\".\n\nA weekly report on his activities shall also be submitted in the form marked as Annex \"P\".\n\n9. When letters are returned for the reason that the taxpayer is no longer at the address indicated, or there is no such address, this fact shall be confirmed by a test checking process.\n\n10. Where the taxpayer requests that the examination be made in his office or place of business, the Regional Director may grant such request or he may direct that the case be referred to the proper field office, depending upon the merits of the request.\n\n11. Interview Procedure \u2014 At the start of the Interview the examiner should introduce himself and in a courteous and tactful manner, proceed with the examination of the return, discouraging any form of conversation which will be alien to the business at hand. The chapters in the Manual of Audit Techniques dealing with the examination of non-business returns and business returns will be very helpful in the investigation of returns classified for office audit. While the taxpayer is in for interview, the examiner should find time to verify the mathematical computations in the return so that any error in computation can be explained.\n\nNote taking and the preparation of working papers during the interview should be the standard practice. There is no necessity for preparing a transcript of all ledger accounts. The only transcripts of ledger accounts necessary are the Cash, Sales, Purchases, Receivable, Payable and Capital Accounts and only when business returns are being examined.\n\nAn analysis of the income and expense accounts which are indicated in the check sheets will be more useful for purposes of review and evaluation of the quality of work performed in each case.\n\nAn analysis of the income and expense accounts which are indicated in the check sheets will be more useful for purposes of review and evaluation of the quality of work performed in each case.\n\nEfforts shall be exerted to complete the examination in one interview.\n\nThe importance of note taking during the interview cannot be over-emphasized. Everything pertinent and material to the case must be written so that any examiner may continue the work on a case by just reading the notes taken during a previous interview without asking the taxpayer all over again questions propounded by the first examiner.\n\n12. Taxpayer not agreeable to proposed deficiency assessment \u2014 Where the taxpayer does not agree with the findings and the recommendations of the examiner and the Group Supervisor, an informal conference shall be conducted by the Chief, Office Audit Section. Whether or not the taxpayer agrees with the final determination in the informal conference conducted, the Group Supervisor shall prepare a memorandum report on the results of the informal conference, which shall form part of the case file to be forwarded for processing to the Assessment Branch. The examiner, shall however prepare his report in accordance with the findings during the conference.\n\nVIII. Preparation of Reports \u2014\n\nA. The preparation of an office audit report (Annex \"Q\") is much simpler than that for field audit case. All information is available in the working papers prepared during the interview and only the adjustments which will give rise to a deficiency assessment would be shown in the report form. A \"No discrepancy\" statement on the report form itself in applicable cases would be sufficient. cdasia\n\nB. Working Papers \u2014 The working papers should include all notes taken during the interview, the ledger accounts required above and analysis of accounts pertinent to the case.\n\nEnclosed are samples (Schedule I to XXI) of what should be included in the working papers. These samples are only illustrative. The examiner may adopt or design other working papers which will effectively explain the matter under audit and which will be reasonably adequate to support conclusions made in the report.\n\nIX. Letter of Confirmation \u2014\n\nWhere a taxpayer requests for a Letter of Confirmation, one may be prepared in the form attached as Annex \"R\". This Letter of Confirmation which shall be prepared by the Chief, Office Audit Section for the signature of the Chief, Assessment Branch shall be issued only upon submission of the report of investigation. The Chief, Office Audit Section shall be the custodian of the blank Letters of Confirmation.\n\nWhere a taxpayer desires to pay the deficiency tax liability found due upon investigation immediately upon completion of the investigation to avoid the accrual of interest, he may be allowed to do so after the issuance of the Letter of Confirmation. The Authority to Issue Revenue Tax Receipt (ATIRTR) shall be prepared for the signature of the Chief, Assessment Branch or of the Chief, Office Audit Section, if authorized by the former official.\n\nX. Termination Letter \u2014\n\nWhere a taxpayer had paid the deficiency tax based upon the report of the examiner before the same was finally approved, the taxpayer shall be informed of the final action on his tax case through a letter attached as Annex \"S\". This letter shall be prepared in the Assessment Branch and attached to the case file which shall be forwarded to the proper official for approval of the report and signature of the letter, in accordance with the delineation of authority embodied in Revenue Memorandum Order No. 65-75, dated November 28, 1975.\n\nXI. Substitution \u2014\n\nAny reference in this Order to Group Supervisor or group shall be substituted by the Assistant Chief, Office Audit Section for the Group Supervisor and examiner for the group where the Office Audit Section does not have enough examiners to be divided into groups.\n\nXII. Repealing Clause \u2014\n\nThe provisions of the Manual on Audit and Investigation Procedure, Field Circular No. V-136 and Revenue Memorandum Order No. 16-72 which are inconsistent herewith are hereby repealed.\n\nXIII. Effectivity \u2014\n\nThe provisions of this Revenue Administrative Order are effective immediately. aisadc\n\nEFREN I. PLANA\nActing Commissioner of Internal Revenue\n\nTAN P4519-F2828-A-8",

To prepare a master list of persons whose net worth has substantially increased since the last declaration, for possible assessment of whatever taxes may be due them.\n\n4. To perform such other functions as the Commissioner may assign to this Unit from time to time as the exigencies of the revenue service may require.\n\nOrganizational Structure\n\nThe Assets, Liabilities and Networth Unit shall be headed by a Unit Chief who shall carry out the duties and functions enumerated above, to make a periodic report to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue regarding the work progress and other vital information which might serve in the formulation of national policies.

                                    "Details": "I. Background and Purpose\n\nA. This revenue administrative order is promulgated in order to further improve the over-all system of investigation of taxpayers for their tax liabilities by the fieldmen of the Bureau pursuant to the provisions of Section 337 of the National Internal Revenue Code, as amended by Section 59 of R.A. 6110, and through the procedure of investigation by lines of businesses. cdta\n\nB. The investigation by lines of businesses will introduce to the Bureau a new concept of investigation. Whereas in the past the investigation is done individually and singly, that is, one taxpayer by one examiner, without regard to the kind of business being engaged in and without collating the findings for possible deficiency taxes in other areas or related taxpayers and preparing statistics for top management, the investigation by lines of businesses will accomplish the following:\n\n1. Insure the investigation of all segments of a particular business which will make possible the analysis of all the discrepancies discovered in the investigation and correlating them in the investigation of a particular industry. This would result in the development of an improved standard procedure of audit of all segments of a particular industry.\n\n2. Considering the modern trends of businesses now whereby the production, marketing and distribution activities are operated or owned by affiliated industries, the investigation by lines of businesses will bring about the discovery of related transactions which may have been resorted to as a means of reducing the tax through shifting of income or overdeclaration of deductions.\n\n3. Investigation by lines of businesses will afford the bureau a chance to make a comparison of selling prices, costs of production and operating expenses of similar businesses enabling it to determine or give close scrutiny to those businesses whose incomes or deductions are substantially different from similar businesses.\n\n4. Through investigation by lines of businesses, the collation of statistics will be facilitated which may be of use in issuance of tax policies or estimating most accurately the revenues that may be expected in the future from each line of business.\n\n5. Through team audit, a thorough investigation will be made of businesses which will bring about the discovery of the capabilities of examiners assigned to undertake such investigations and thereby help the top management of the bureau in the assignment of personnel where their abilities can be maximized or fully availed of and provide guidelines for the transfer of non-productive personnel or make them undergo further training to improve their effectiveness.\n\n6. Through the implementation of the \"package audit\" as provided in Section 337 of the Tax Code, as amended by R.A. 6110, the tax liabilities of the taxpayer will be thoroughly investigated in one audit thereby avoiding the frequent visits of examiners which gives rise to irritants between the taxpayers and the bureau.\n\n7. Consolidate pertinent provisions of orders, circulars and memoranda into one order to facilitate implementation and to provide a preference manual on the matter.\n\n8. Update and improve outmoded provisions of orders, circulars, and memoranda regarding the assignment and distribution of tax returns, cases and dockets to the fieldmen.\n\n9. Provide a more effective supervision and control over the conduct of investigations and the reporting of the results thereof, and\n\n10. Fix responsibilities.\n\nII. Organization\n\nThe different divisions in the Special Operations Department and Revenue District Offices in Regional Offices will be reorganized to suit the requirements and needs in the investigation by lines of businesses, outlined as follows:\n\nA. National Office\n\n1. The Audit Division, International Operations Division, Special Laws Enforcement Division, Fraud Investigation Division and the Special Operations Department are hereby abolished.\n\n2. In accordance with the lines of businesses, the following divisions shall be created in lieu of the divisions abolished.\n\na. Agriculture and Natural Resources (Audit) Division;\n\nb. Manufacturing (Audit) Division;\n\nc. Financing, Real Estate and Transfer Taxes (Audit) Division;\n\nd. Services and Miscellaneous (Audit) Division;\n\ne. Special Investigation Division.\n\n3. The personnel of the present Audit, International Operations and Special Laws Enforcement Divisions after reducing them to the necessary complement shall be distributed to the Agriculture and Natural Resources (Audit) Division; Manufacturing (Audit) Division; Finance, Real Estate and Transfer Taxes (Audit) Division; and Services and Miscellaneous (Audit) Division.\n\n4. The unit in the present Special Laws Enforcement Division engaged in the investigation of syndicated crimes and apprehension of fake stamps, fake receipts and smuggling shall be converted as a unit and be constituted as the Intelligence Arm of the Bureau of Internal Revenue and placed under the direct supervision of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. Its powers and duties are contained in another Administrative Order.\n\n5. The personnel of the Fraud Investigation Division shall remain intact and records thereof as well as the personnel shall be transferred to the Special Investigation Division, the new name of the division.\n\n6. All records in the divisions to be abolished should be compiled, collated and forwarded to the Information and Retrieval Section of the Special Investigation Division for use by the said division in its fraud investigation and as reference by the newly created divisions.\n\n7. Equipments in the abolished divisions shall be divided equitably among the newly created divisions. The clerical force in these three divisions should be equitably divided and care should be taken that the stenographers and typists are equitably distributed in the said divisions to insure efficiency in their operations and in the preparation of reports and statistics of the fieldmen and the filing of the said records.\n\nB. Regional Offices\n\n1. The grouping of personnel in regional offices is hereby revoked and a new grouping in accordance with the lines of businesses shall be made which shall depend on the number of businesses found in each district, the investigation of which has been allocated to the Regional Office. Businesses which are not included in the grouping by lines of businesses and the jurisdiction of which shall be exclusively with the Regional Office, such as general merchandising, department stores, etc. should all be assigned to the examiners in the revenue district offices. cdti\n\n2. Consonant with the policy of giving more autonomy to Regional Directors, the grouping and delineating of work assignments to fieldmen in Revenue District Offices shall be done by the Regional Director concerned with the assistance of the Revenue District Officers but the pattern of grouping in the National Office should as much as possible be adhered to.\n\nC. General Organization\n\n1. In the newly created divisions in the National Office the various industries shall be further allocated to sections, which shall be composed of groups and sub-groups. To avoid the creation of too many sections, grouping of similar or alike industries in a section should be made like forestry which although a broad industry should only be made into a section.\n\n2. Since there may not be enough groups available to each segment of the industry or the industry as a whole, two or more industries or segments thereof may be assigned to a group of fieldmen for investigation. In the assignment of the different segments of an industry, the grouping of closely related processes should be taken into account; that is, any two segments assigned to one group should be the segment which comes after the other in the process of production or manufacture like wholesale dealers and retail dealers.\n\n3. Regional Assignments\n\na. The investigation of industries or segments thereof which have been allocated to the regional office should not be assigned to any of the groups or subgroups or team in the National Office.\n\nb. The Regional Director concerned should be informed of the segments of industries or industries allocated for investigation in the region who should prepare the necessary assignments. The audit program of the region which should include the grouping of segments of the industry or industries allocated to the Regional Office should be forwarded to the National Office for information and appropriate action by the latter.\n\n4. In cases where the investigation of taxpayers engaged in the segment of the industry or the industry may be undertaken by both the National and Regional Offices, the particular taxpayers assigned to the National Office shall be assigned to the groups therein and those taxpayers assigned to the Regional Office should be communicated to the Regional Director for appropriate action as provided in the preceding paragraph.\n\n5. Grouping of Fieldmen\n\na. To achieve maximum results and effective supervision the groups in the National Office should consist of ten (10) examiners and one group supervisor, or a total of eleven (11) in each group. This does not preclude the division of the group into subgroups or teams under a team leader which may be assigned a particular line of business but the overall supervision of the group rests with the group supervisor.\n\nb. The same pattern should be followed in the regions as much as possible and where there are any deviations from the set-up in the National Office, such fact should be communicated to the National Office by the Regional Director.\n\nc. For purposes of assignment of personnel in the divisions, sections and groups, it shall be the policy to make those higher in rank as Supervisors and in no case shall an examiner with a higher rank be placed under a supervisor with a lower rank.\n\nd. In the selection of examiners to be retained in the National Office, those with the best qualifications should be given priority in the retention. Some of the considerations shall be appropriate civil service eligibility; educational attainment \u2014 CPA or lawyer, or both; appointment \u2014 at least Revenue Examiner II; previous experience; outstanding achievements; and accomplishments as shown in the report of the Management Survey Team. cdt\n\ne. Designation of supervisors\n\n(1) For the purpose of staffing the divisions, the Chief of Division should have a range not lower than Chief Revenue Examiner or Chief Revenue Inspector.\n\n(2) For Assistant Chief of Division, the range should not be lower than Supervising Revenue Examiner III.\n\n(3) For Chief of Section, the range should not be lower than Supervising Revenue Examiner III.\n\n(4) For Group Supervisor, the range should not be lower than Supervising Revenue Examiner II.\n\n(5) For the Team Leader of the subgroup, the range should not be lower than Supervising Revenue Examiner I.\n\nf. In assigning the fieldmen to the group, the grouping should be pyramidal, that is, there should be more fieldmen of the lower range than those of the higher range. No group or subgroup should be staffed with only one range of examiners but should include the appropriate ranges in a manner that a subgroup will at least have a Supervising Revenue Examiner I as team leader.\n\ng. The pattern of grouping in the region should adhere as closely as possible to the grouping in the National Office but the mechanics thereof shall be the responsibility of the Regional Director with the assistance of the Revenue District Officers. The range of the Group Supervisor should be at least Supervising Revenue Examiner I for first class revenue districts and Senior Revenue Examiner for other revenue districts.\n\nh. In cases where there are not enough groups or subgroups in the revenue district for the different kinds of industries or segments of industry assigned thereto, two or more segments of the industry may be assigned to one group or subgroup subject to the provisions of paragraph II-C-2 of this Revenue Administrative Order.\n\ni. Fraternization and Transfer. In order to make effective the assignment of fieldmen in each group, to avoid the evil effects of fraternization and in order that the training of fieldmen may be well-rounded in all kinds of businesses, the fieldmen assigned to the groups or subgroups should be rotated at least once every two years but if the exigencies of the service so requires, the re-assignment of any fieldman in a particular group may be effected at anytime.\n\nj. If there is a lack of men in any group either in the National Office or in the Regional Office, additional men from other regions where their services can be spared should be deployed to those offices or units where they are needed.\n\nk. Coordinators\n\n(1) To insure effective implementation, coordinators from the National Office should be designated to coordinate activities in the Regional Offices in relation to the activities in the National Office. For this purpose, the Philippines is divided into five areas with a coordinator in each area.\n\n(2) The coordinators in the Regional Offices shall be under the control and direct supervision of the National Coordinator in the National Office.\n\n(3) To coordinate the activities of the divisions in the National Office and Regional Offices, a National Coordinator should be designated in the National Office who should be responsible to the Commissioner and Deputy Commissioner for Operations.\n\n(4) The National Coordinator shall be assisted in addition to the Area Coordinators by a staff composed of ranking officials of the bureau.\n\n(5) The National Coordinator shall be responsible for:\n\n(a) Coordination of activities of the Agriculture and Natural Resources (Audit) Division; Manufacturing (Audit) Division; Financing, Real Estate and Transfer Taxes (Audit) Division and Services and Miscellaneous (Audit) Division.\n\n(b) Supervision over the area coordinators wherein he must see to it that discrepancies discovered by examiners in Regional Offices reported by the Area Coordinator as related to or needs verification with the findings in the investigation of segments of the industry or industries examined by the National Office or vice-versa are taken into account in the reporting of the investigated cases.\n\n(c) Supervision in the collation, summarizing and analyzing of data taken from the reports of investigation.\n\n(d) Supervision of the administrative phase of industries enjoying incentives. Such supervision should include the determination and checking as to whether the industries operating under incentives are fulfilling the requirements; preparation of reports and other correspondence and action on cases other than the investigation phase.\n\nFor this purpose and to achieve close supervision over these industries with special incentives, a separate unit in the staff should be created.\n\nIII. Duties and responsibilities of Group Supervisors\n\nAs soon as assignments of the lines of industries or segments thereof have been made to the group, the group supervisor before making any assignments to fieldmen shall accomplish the following:\n\nA. Hold a seminar of the group to which may be invited resource speakers coming from the higher echelons of the bureau or from outside for dissemination of guidelines to be used in the investigation of the taxpayers concerned. Such guidelines should include among others the following:\n\n1. Nature of the business and how it operates;\n\n2. Taxes payable by the business;\n\n3. Based on past experiences, methods of evasion resorted to by the taxpayer; and\n\n4. Audit techniques.\n\nB. All available records of past investigations of the taxpayer should be looked into to determine whether there are any items which may be useful in the investigation of its subsequent tax liabilities.\n\nC. Conduct a background research of the taxpayer to determine the characteristics of the business, tax returns being filed and such other items that may be necessary in determining the correct amount of taxes due.\n\nD. If the industry is regulated or under the supervision of any unit or agency of the government, contact should be made with the government unit or agency to determine peculiar facts that characterize the industry.\n\nE. The group head should keep a complete record of the assignments and he shall exercise close supervision in the investigation of taxpayers assigned to his group and subgroups.\n\nF. He should prepare an audit program for the particular industries or segments thereof which should include a schedule of activities. He should see to it that there is proper apportionment of time assigned to each particular industry so that there will be no time wasted and efforts of the fieldmen will be fully utilized. Overlapping of investigations or assignments should be avoided as much as possible to insure effective control of the investigation of cases and the prompt termination of investigations and the reporting thereof. cdtai\n\nVI. Jurisdiction of Investigation\n\nA. BOI Industries\n\nIndustries operating under the Board of Investments or such other special laws granting incentives to taxpayers presently under the jurisdiction of the Special Laws Enforcement Division shall be assigned to the division or group where the particular industry belongs.\n\nB. Interrelated Industries\n\n1. In the case of interrelated industries, the different industries shall be assigned to the division and group where the particular industry belong.\n\n2. For purposes of investigating the parent or management corporation, a composite team headed by a supervisor selected by the National Coordinator should be formed to be composed of men from the various groups which investigated the interrelated industries.\n\n3. For an effective review of the reports submitted and close coordination of the investigation and inasmuch as management or parent companies do not belong to any of the divisions, the report thereon should be submitted direct to the National Coordinator.\n\nC. Withholding Tax Division\n\nThe Withholding Tax Division of the Assessment Department shall have jurisdiction over the following:\n\n1. Processing of the report of investigation of Withholding tax at source submitted by the fieldmen of the division to which the particular industry has been assigned.\n\n2. Synchronization of the investigation of employers for withholding tax on wages with the investigation of the other tax liabilities of the employer. For this purpose, fieldmen of the Withholding Tax Division should be assigned to the group or team in the National Office conducting the regular investigation of the employers but he shall be under the administrative control of the Chief, Withholding Tax Division.\n\n3. The investigation of employers in Regional Offices, including those of Regional Offices 6, 7 and 8 shall be undertaken by the examiners in the region simultaneously with the investigation of income and other internal revenue tax liabilities of the employer. To achieve uniformity in investigation and reporting, guidelines should be issued by the Withholding Tax Division to Regional Offices. The reports on withholding tax investigations should be processed in the Withholding Tax Division.\n\n4. Synchronization of the investigation for withholding tax purposes under R.A. 1051 with the particular group to which the industry belong. For this purpose, examiners of the Withholding Tax Division should be attached to the group conducting the investigation, but they shall be under the administrative control of the Chief, Withholding Tax Division.\n\nHowever, where the government agency subject to the provisions of Rep. Act 1051 is not performing proprietary functions and, therefore, not subject to any kind of tax, investigation thereof shall be the jurisdiction of the Withholding Tax Division.\n\n5. Investigation of individuals claiming tax credit for taxes withheld from wages which may be refundable or collectible except where the individual concerned is engaged in business or has other income in other schedules in the income tax return, excluding refundable returns which would fall under the office audit classification.\n\nD. Specific Tax Department\n\n1. For the proper enforcement of the specific tax law, close coordination should be maintained between the Specific Tax Department on one hand and the divisions organized by lines of businesses and Regional Offices on the other hand.\n\n2. For this purpose, a Coordinator is to be designated to supervise and coordinate the investigation of specific taxes in collaboration with the investigation of the other tax liabilities. The coordinator upon request of the group concerned and the recommendation of the Chief of the Specific Tax Department shall assign men from the Specific Tax Department to the group in the division or in the Regional Offices to investigate the taxpayer for specific tax liabilities.\n\n3. The reports of fieldmen assigned to specific tax investigations should be made part of the report of the team but the Coordinator for Specific Taxes should see to it that he reviews the findings and forward them to the Specific Tax Department for appropriate action.\n\nV. Reporting\n\nA. Nature of Report\n\n1. Since the reports of investigation can only be properly evaluated through the reporting thereof, a procedure should be devised which should be simple but qualitative. Simple in the sense that too many reports which may be overlapping should not be prepared and qualitative in the sense that the report can be easily understood, the discrepancies clearly identifiable and that the statistics as shown by the results of the investigation quickly picked up, collated, utilized and analyzed.\n\n2. For this purpose, a method of reporting should be promulgated to include all the necessary data for computerization and use by the Bureau for the formulation of policies and the proper administration of said policies.\n\n3. In the procedure for reporting, there should be included a system of costing: that is, determine how much it costs the government to conduct investigations. Costs shall include salaries, traveling and such other items of sundry expenses that enter into the cost of investigation.\n\nVI. Review\n\nA. Who shall review\n\n1. The investigation function shall stop at the stage where the notice to the taxpayer has been sent. Thereafter, the investigation function ceases and the docket or case shall then be forwarded to the Assessment Department in the National Office or the Assessment Branch in the Regional Office. cdti\n\n2. The responsibility of the said department or branch shall consist of the following:\n\na. Review of the case to determine whether all aspects have been covered and whether all the requirements of reporting are complied with.\n\nb. Sending of the preliminary five-day letter if the taxpayer is not in agreement.\n\nc. Preparation of the corresponding letter of demand.\n\nd. Regional Office\n\n(1) With respect to those cases assigned to the regional offices, the jurisdiction as to its review shall be the same as at present: to the group supervisor, then to the revenue district officer and finally to the regional director.\n\n(2) Before final action toward assessment of the report is made, the findings shall be evaluated by the Area Coordinator assigned in the region to determine whether it may affect other segments of the industry. The findings of the Area Coordinator should be communicated to the National Coordinator.\n\n3. The present procedure of elevating cases to the National Office where the amount of deficiency tax or even though there is no deficiency tax, the taxes due per return exceeds certain fixed amounts as provided in Revenue Administrative Orders Nos. 13-64 and 14-64 should be continued.\n\n4. Where some taxpayers engaged in a segment of the industry are assigned for investigation to the region and the rest of the taxpayers in the group are assigned to the National Office, the final review of all reports of investigation on all these taxpayers shall be exclusively the prerogative of the Assessment Department.\n\nVII. Determination of the Efficiency of the Examiners\n\nA. The National Coordinator and Assessment Branches in the Regional Offices shall provide a procedure whereby the examiner can be graded on his accomplishments which will be taken into consideration in determining his performance rating.\n\nB. Such procedure should not solely depend on the assessment or collections made by the examiners.\n\nC. In determining accomplishments of examiners for assessment purposes, the division concerned shall prepare a monthly report of all reports submitted and released for review and demand. The assessments shown therein shall be the one credited to the fieldman.\n\nD. The previous practice of examiners of reporting assessments although the report has not been passed upon by superior officers should be stopped. Only after the report has been passed upon and released for assessment should the examiner be entitled to the credit of the assessment.\n\nE. If the report is submitted by a group, the assessments or collections reported should be divided equally among the examiners who conducted the investigation.\n\nF. This determination shall be made by the Chief of the Division and the supervisor should see to it that there are no free riders in the assessment reported. Free riders shall be held to mean examiners who merely sign the report without assisting in the investigation of the case.\n\nG. In the preparation of Form 40.00 by the divisions of the Assessment Department or by the Assessment Branch, a column should be added or the remarks column utilized for the placing of code numbers of the examiners that participated in the investigation.\n\nH. The Data Processing Center in processing Form 40.00 shall take into account the code numbers of the examiners and they should prepare a list whereby the respective shares of each examiner in the assessments are properly recorded.\n\nI. In processing collections of deficiency taxes, the Data Processing Center should determine whether the collections reported on deficiency taxes belong to the particular examiners who should be properly credited. These collections should be collated and properly credited to each examiner and the total thereof determined which should be used as basis in computing how much is the collection of each examiner through investigation. cd\n\nVIII. Scope of Investigation\n\nA. The ordinary examination or investigation of taxpayers' books of accounts, including subsidiary books and other accounting records for the purpose of determining their liabilities for the following taxes shall be made simultaneously, once in a taxable year except in the cases provided in Section 337 of the National Internal Revenue Code, as amended:\n\n1. Income tax, including\n\na. Withholding tax on wages\n\nb. Withholding tax at source under Sections 53 and 54\n\n2. Transfer taxes\n\n3. Privilege taxes on business and occupation\n\n4. Documentary stamp tax\n\n5. Mining taxes\n\n6. Tax on banks\n\n7. Tax on finance companies\n\n8. Tax on receipts of insurance companies\n\n9. Franchise tax\n\n10. Amusement taxes\n\n11. Forest charges\n\n12. Residence taxes\n\n13. Sugar tax\n\nVerification of compliance with bookkeeping requirements and of submission of required attachments and other information required to be submitted and test-checking of inventory lists filed shall also be included in the examination or investigation.\n\nB. In view of the provisions of section 337 of the National Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the \"package audit policy\" shall be adopted in the examination of the various tax liabilities of the taxpayer. \"Package audit\" provides for the examination at the same time of all returns filed by a business or a taxpayer or all his taxable transactions for the same taxable period.\n\nC. Investigation of collectible accounts\n\n1. In order to reduce our collectible accounts to the minimum and in order to have a systematic procedure in determining the status of taxpayers' collectible accounts, examining officers should also include in the investigation of any taxpayer's liabilities the determination of their pending collectible accounts. They shall render a report on the results of their verification of the latest list of collectible accounts and/or the taxpayers' records, on the form prescribed for this purpose. If the examining officer finds that the particular taxpayer under examination has no pending collectible account, he shall so certify in his report. If the records show that the taxpayer has pending collectible accounts, the examiner shall specify in his report the nature, kind, period or year of delinquency, and status of the collectible account. The examining officer shall try to effect collection of any delinquency of the taxpayer under investigation and if he fails to do so, to state in his report why the taxpayer did not settle the delinquency.\n\n2. If the collectible account is contested by the taxpayer and there is a need for reinvestigation, the examiner should secure a copy of the letter of protest from the taxpayer. He should include this in his report stating that the taxpayer is not paying his collectible account because his protest has not been resolved.\n\n3. This report shall be forwarded by the Chief, Assessment Branch or the Revenue Operations Head (Assessment) as the case may be to the Collection Branch or to the Collection Department for processing and for the institution of the necessary follow-up procedure.\n\n4. In protested cases, the Chief of the Assessment Branch or Revenue Operations Head (Assessment) shall determine the status of the protest and follow it up accordingly so that the case may be immediately terminated. Due notice should be given by the branch or department concerned to the Data Processing Center so that the case can be transferred from Collectible Accounts to Deferred Accounts or vice-versa.\n\nD. Delineation of Investigations\n\n1. Cases in which the Regional Director with the approval of the Commissioner requests that the tax return of a taxpayer in his region be examined by the National Office should be referred to the Division charged with the investigation of taxpayers engaged in the particular industry. Fraud referral cases shall, however, be referred to the Special Investigation Division.\n\n2. If in the course of the investigation by the four divisions or the regional offices, indication of fraud is discovered, the case should be immediately referred to the Special Investigation Division to determine whether criminal prosecution is warranted.\n\n3. Special Investigation Division\n\na. The division shall have nationwide jurisdiction in the investigation and prosecution of all kinds of criminal tax fraud cases initiated and/or developed by it and all tax cases referred to it from various sources especially where a prima facie case or evidence of fraud has been established. In all instances, the determination of whether a fraud case is civil or criminal shall be the responsibility of the Special Investigation Division.\n\nb. All referrals coming from regional offices and other investigating divisions in the National Office showing indications of fraud shall be handled by the Special Investigation Division. The division shall take charge of the investigation of said referrals for criminal prosecution and determination of the civil liability. Whether the case is ultimately prosecuted or not, the investigation of the civil liability of the referrals shall be handled by the Special Investigation Division.\n\nc. Review of cases where the Commissioner has determined that there has been collusion between examiners and taxpayers in the examination of a tax case.\n\n4. Office audit\n\na. The procedure outlined in Revenue Administrative Order No. 7-64, dated September 1, 1964, shall continue to be followed in Regional Offices Nos. 6, 7 and 8 and such other regions as may have been or may be authorized to conduct office audit of returns.\n\nb. \"Package Audit\" policy shall also be implemented in office audit cases.\n\nIX. Submission of Audit Reports\n\nA. All field and office audit reports submitted must comply with the requirements of the Handbook on Auditing Techniques and Procedures as promulgated in Revenue Memorandum Order No. 25-65, dated July 1, 1965 and Revenue Administrative Order No. 7-64 dated September 1, 1964, respectively, and with the procedures and requirements provided in Revenue Memorandum Order No. 17-66, dated February 23, 1966.\n\nB. The said reports shall likewise comply with the requirements of the following:\n\n1. Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 9-68 dated March 1, 1968, the subject matter of which is cross-checking of recipients of income liable to file income tax returns with the master file of taxpayers.\n\n2. Revenue Memorandum Order No. 8-67, dated February 1, 1967, the subject matter of which is the submission of a separate report on the internal revenue tax payments of the taxpayer for the period or years investigated.\n\nC. Separate reports on the withholding tax on wages shall be prepared for transmittal to the Withholding Tax Division in the National Office for processing and evaluation.\n\nD. Likewise, separate reports shall be prepared for each kind of tax for an intelligent, adequate, systematic and accurate review by superior officers.\n\nX. Miscellaneous Provisions\n\nA. Cases determined by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue as sensitive, policy, or affecting national security shall be given priority over all other cases by the Division undertaking the investigation. These shall include cases referred by the President of the Philippines, Congress, and the Secretary of Finance.\n\nB. All unverified returns of a taxpayer for previous years shall be included in the authority for the latest year.\n\nC. If two or more authorities were issued for different years to different examiners, the examiner assigned the latest year shall be given the right to consolidate the investigation. If authorities were not served upon the taxpayer within thirty (30) days after issuance, they shall be cancelled and surrendered.\n\nD. No letter of authority or memorandum letter for the investigation of the estate and inheritance tax liabilities shall be issued until after the required return is filed in accordance with the provisions of section 96 of the National Internal Revenue Code or after the return has become due but no return has been filed and no request for extension for filing the return was made. When estate and inheritance tax returns are filed within the time prescribed in Section 93 of the Tax Code, it may be made the basis for the issuance of an authority for package audit for the taxable year it was filed.\n\nE. In the investigation of estate and inheritance tax returns all unverified tax returns of the deceased shall be included in the investigation.\n\nXI. Repealing Clause\n\nThe provisions or portions thereof of Field Circular Nos. V-70 and V-157, Revenue Administrative Order No. 6-67, Revenue Memorandum Circular Nos. 20-64; 22-64; 21-65; 30-65; 33-65; 40-65 and 27-65 and Revenue Memorandum Orders Nos. 28-64; 14-65 and 29-65, which are inconsistent with the provisions of this Revenue Administrative Order are hereby revoked or amended accordingly.\n\nXII. Effectivity\n\nThis Revenue Administrative Order shall take effect upon approval thereof. aisadc\n\nMISAEL P.

The proximity of those establishments to the National Office more than justifies their being placed directly under the National Office and thereby, making it more convenient and expeditious for the taxpayers concerned to transact their business with the National Office without having to undertake the usual routing of their papers through any regional office also located within Manila and its environs.\n\nIn view thereof, a Specific Tax Branch is hereby created in each of the revenue regions, except in Revenue Regions Nos. 5, 6, 7 and 8 to take charge of administration and enforcement of all specific tax laws, the Tobacco Inspection Law(Act 2613, as amended) and their implementing revenue regulations. In the cases of the Specific Tax Branches in Revenue Region No. 4, San Fernando, Pampanga, and in Revenue Region No. 9 San Pablo City, their jurisdiction for purposes of specific taxes and tobacco inspection fees shall not include the municipalities of Apalit, Pampanga, and San Pedro, Laguna, respectively.\n\nORGANIZATION & STAFFING OF THE BRANCH\n\nThe Specific Tax Branch shall be headed by a Chief, who shall be assisted by an Assistant Branch Chief, a Tobacco & Miscellaneous Tax Supervisor, Alcohol Tax Supervisor, Tobacco Inspection Supervisor and an appropriate number of revenue inspectors and clerical personnel to carry out the functions of said Branch in the revenue region. However, the geographical size of the region, the number of establishments to be supervised and/or the amount of collections in specific taxes and/or tobacco inspection fees shall determine the necessity and the budgetary practicality of constituting a complete staff for each Specific Tax Branch as above-enumerated. Where the business conditions and other pertinent circumstances in any particular region do not warrant the designation of a Chief of Branch and his complete staff of assistants, an officer-in-charge may be designated to head a skeletal force of field and clerical personnel reasonably sufficient to discharge satisfactorily the functions of a regularly constituted branch and shall be called a Specific Tax Unit.\n\nThe designation and ranking of the officials and other personnel of the Specific Tax Branch or Specific Tax Unit shall be based and determined on their educational qualifications, relevant training and experience in specific tax and/or tobacco inspection laws and regulations, as well as the position title and salary range of the official or personnel concerned.\n\nThe Chief, Specific Tax Branch, shall also serve as a member of the staff in the regional office and act as the adviser of the regional director in matters relating to the administration and enforcement of existing specific tax and tobacco inspection laws and applicable revenue regulations. In case of absence or incapacity to attend regional staff meetings, said branch chief may designate any of his subordinate officials to represent him during such meetings or conferences. cdrep\n\nORGANIZATIONAL FUNCTIONS & PROCEDURES\n\nThe regional director shall exercise general supervisory and disciplinary powers over all officials and personnel of the Specific Tax Branch or Specific Tax Unit under his jurisdiction. Accordingly, the regional director may initiate appropriate action or proceedings against any erring official or employee of the said Branch in accordance with established civil service rules and office procedures.\n\nWith the concurrence of the regional director, the Chief, Specific Tax Branch, may initiate or recommend to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, through the Revenue Operations Head (Specific Tax), any promotion, transfer or reassignment of personnel of the said branch.\n\nAll papers, correspondence, and other official matters, administrative or operational in nature, addressed to or originating from the Specific Tax Branch shall be coursed through the Office of the Regional Director in accordance with standard operating procedures and established office policies.\n\nAll applications for reglementary permits for establishments located outside of the direct jurisdictional control and supervision of the National Office shall be submitted to the Regional Director, Attention: The Chief, Specific Tax Branch, for necessary processing or verification by said branch and the papers shall be forwarded with the least practicable delay to the National Office for final action by higher authorities on the basis of the action taken and recommendation made at regional level.\n\nThe administrative functions of the Specific Tax Branch shall be governed by the same standard operating procedures applicable to the other branches in the regional office. The operational functions of said branch shall be in accordance with those promulgated or established in the National Office relating to the collection of specific taxes and tobacco inspection fees and the supervision of establishments subject to the payment thereof. Any problem relating to the administration and enforcement of existing specific tax and tobacco inspection laws and applicable revenue regulations not covered by previous instructions or established procedures should be immediately elevated to the National Office for appropriate section or decision by proper authorities.\n\nAny previous orders, instructions, circulars, memoranda or portions thereof inconsistent herewith are hereby revoked.

The faulty implementation is generally attributed to the lack of discipline among the fieldmen and failure of supervisors to appropriately supervise their subordinate employees. To restore discipline among our working force and to achieve a more effective implementation of our assessment procedures, it is deemed imperative to strengthen the field audit group supervisor by promulgating hereunder a statement of his duties, responsibilities and authority. In revenue district offices where there is not enough fieldmen to group them into at least two groups, the \"field audit supervisor\" cited in this order shall be considered as referring to the Revenue District Officer or the Assistant Revenue District Officer if there is one in the district. cdasia\n\nI. RESPONSIBILITIES AND DUTIES OF THE FIELD AUDIT GROUP SUPERVISOR \u2014\n\nThe field audit supervisor is responsible for the performance and conduct of each technical and clerical employee assigned to work in his group. He is responsible for such related duties as administration of leave, identification and recommendation of employees for promotion to position within or outside the group, and care of property assigned to the group. He is also responsible for holding informal conferences with taxpayers, checking and supervising the activities of the employees and such other duties inherent to an effective administration and supervision of the employees under his jurisdiction.\n\nThe group supervisor's principal function is to see that his group works efficiently and effectively to best accomplish the task assigned to it under the district audit program. He must keep his Revenue District Officer informed on the progress of group activities and must concern himself with group activities to a degree which ensures that each employee in his group: is adequately informed of policies, procedures, programs, objectives and other related matters; that his full potential is developed; that responsibilities are discharged in accordance with established guidelines; and that work is performed adequately and competently with a minimum of detailed direction. He also sees to it that sub-marginal work is identified and improved; that outstanding work is recognized and commended; and that appropriate actions are initiated to correct reassign or discipline employees, if their work or activities fail to meet prescribed standards.\n\nThe group supervisor must devote appropriate attention to the identification and solution of those specific problems in the group's operations which have substantial effects in the group accomplishments. He must apply his efforts in accordance with actual need and in a manner which will best provide the greatest amount of supervisory attention to solving specific problems. He does this by:\n\nA. Keeping Himself and His Group Informed\n\n1. The Group Supervisor must keep himself posted, on all policies, programs, procedures, guidelines and technical developments. He monitors the distribution of management documents and technical materials to ensure that employees are kept up to date. He follows up to ensure that adequate reference and research material is maintained and that the content of published material is understood by the employees in his group.\n\n2. In monitoring the flow of written material, the Group Supervisor ensures maximum use of such material to communicate needed instructions to employees without burdening them with reading material for which they have no immediate or direct concern.\n\nB. Planning and Scheduling Work\n\n1. The Group Supervisor establishes and maintains sufficient plans to ensure orderly and efficient operation of his group. His plans supplement established Audit programs and provide for any specific actions or instructions which are needed to implement these programs within his group.\n\n2. He schedules his own activities and budgets his time to each activity as needed to ensure that adequate attention is given to each phase of his work.\n\n3. He requires his employees to plan and schedule their work as needed to ensure that all group activities are performed in a timely, orderly, and effective manner.\n\nC. Surveying and Assigning Work\n\n1. The Group Supervisor appraises all work which flows into or originates within the group. He ensures that all work is classified according to level of difficulty, audit potential, priority, geographical location, and other significant assignment factors.\n\n2. He arranges for timely assignment of appropriate work to each of his employees. He promptly identifies and surveys less important work which exceed the group's work capacity.\n\n3. In providing for the assignment of work, he ensures that related matters are associated for the most effective handling and that assignments are properly rotated.\n\nD. Reviewing Activity, Time and Inventory Records\n\n1. The Group Supervisor reviews each audit report, daily activity report, and similar reports prepared by employees in his group.\n\n2. He correlates the information in these reports with data reflected by examination record cards, Form 19.67, and other such records and identifies any matters which may require follow-up action.\n\n3. Through his review of activity, time and inventory records, he identifies indications of work problems such as improper scheduling of priority work; ineffective application of time to multiple assignments; inadequate or excessive amounts of work in process; improper pre-examination planning and excessive delays in completing assignments. For example, comparison of his daily itinerary may disclose that an employee has started work on a lower priority assignment when his inventory includes uncompleted or unstarted higher priority work. This indicates that the employee may have planned his work improperly or that he may have encountered difficulty in some of his work in process.\n\nE. Reviewing and Directing Performance of Work\n\n1. The Group Supervisor continually looks into the performance of all group activities and provides direction where needed. In reviewing and directing group activities, the Group Supervisor uses such means as observing the activities of his employees in the office and on the job; reviewing work plans and work in process; counseling with employees; and participating with employees in discussions with taxpayers and representatives. aisadc\n\n2. He keeps himself readily available to each of his employees and encourage them to discuss their problems.\n\n3. He also makes frequent visits through the work areas to observe the activities of his employees. Through such means, the Group Supervisor promptly identifies and corrects improper work practices before they become major problems.\n\n4. When he identifies a specific need which requires his personal attention to some phase of an employee's work outside of the office, he arranges to visit with the employee on the job. He normally makes such visits to pinpoint and correct a particular problem, to provide necessary advice and direction, or to improve his employee's dealings with taxpayers and representatives. Since unnecessary visits can waste a substantial amount of both the Supervisor's and employee's time, the Supervisors considers alternative means for attending to his employee's needs before making a visit. For example, the Group Supervisor learns that an examiner is having difficulty obtaining the information he needs to complete his examination of a return. Depending upon the circumstances, the Supervisor reviews the matter in his Office, suggests a new approach, and follows up later; he requests a more experienced examiner to assists in the matter; or he visits the examiner on the job and personally directs the latter how to proceed.\n\n5. He joins with his employees in the closing of cases when he identifies a need to do so and when he believes that his participation will improve case development or resolve differences between his employees and other parties. In deciding whether to participate in his employees' case closing process, the Group Supervisor weighs the advantages of prompt closing of cases against the disadvantages of assuming a measure of his employees' responsibilities. He participates in such a manner as will strengthen the development of cases and improve his employees' abilities to close cases on their own. The Group Supervisor reviews the facts indicating a need for his participation. Where practical, he first affords his employee an opportunity to correct any indicated deficiencies; but, if necessary, he joins with the employee to conclude discussions with the taxpayer or his representative.\n\n6. He continually seeks to achieve the most effective utilization of clerical and technical time in his group. He promptly looks into indications of ineffective work practices, backlogs, and other work problems. As needed to achieve the best overall use of time, he suggests more effective examination practices and techniques, reassigns work, reschedules work, simplifies and improves clerical practices, and shifts non-technical work from technical employees to clerical employees.\n\nF. Controlling and Reviewing Completed Work\n\n1. The Group Supervisor maintains a system of control and approval over completed work to ensure that work is adequately developed before it is released from the group and to provide information needed for his follow-up on individual and group activities and accomplishments.\n\n2. He relies upon established District and Regional review functions to keep him informed on the mathematical, procedural and technical exactitude of work performed by his employees. He carefully considers advisory, correction and other memoranda reflecting results of functional reviews; he determines what specific and overall corrective measures are necessary in his group; and he follows up to ensure that mathematical, procedural and technical inadequacies are promptly remedied.\n\n3. He looks into each report and case file as a source of information necessary for effective management and operation of his group. This information supplements that which is provided through other means such as review of time, inventory records, work in process, reviewer's correction and advisory memoranda and discussions with his employees. For example, he looks into the case to determine how efficiently the examination was planned and whether it was conducted in accordance with the plan.\n\nG. Evaluating and Improving Performance of Employees\n\n1. The Group Supervisor ensures that each technical and clerical employee in his group is adequately informed on job requirements and performance standards.\n\n2. He continually appraises each employee's work in light of established standards. He commends his employees when their performance exceeds prescribed standards; he promptly advises his employees when any phase of their activity fails to meet these standards; and he prescribes measures necessary to improve performance.\n\n3. He maintains a file concerning each employee's performance and records significant performance developments as needed to support personnel actions such as annual performance ratings, recommendations for promotions, outstanding awards and recommendations for disciplinary action. The Supervisor's files cover such matters as cases returned for correction, instructions and directions furnished to employees, and results of supervisory visits and reviews.\n\n4. In the case of continued substandard performance by an employee, he initiates appropriate action.\n\nH. Maintaining Effective Public Relations\n\n1. The Group Supervisor ensures that his employees are courteous, firm, and reasonable in the performance of their work; and he encourages cooperation between his employees and taxpayers or their representatives.\n\n2. In situations where unfavorable relations are indicated, he determines what has transpired and what corrective measures are needed.\n\nI. Maintaining Integrity and Security\n\n1. The Group Supervisor ensures that the employees in his group are adequately informed concerning the policies, procedures and rules covering, employee conduct and disclosure of official information;\n\n2. Ensures adequate measures are employed to maintain security of official information;\n\n3. Appropriate actions are taken to report indications of bribery or misconduct.\n\nJ. Keeping Management Informed\n\n1. The Group Supervisor ensures that timely, accurate, and complete reports are prepared and submitted as required under established district, regional, and national reporting programs. cdtai\n\n2. He supplements these reports as needed to keep his Chief informed on the group's operations;\n\n3. He promptly reports any matter which require the Chief's attention, such as workload substantially in excess of the group's work capacity, inadequate inventories of work in planned grade levels or categories, and conflicts between his group and other organizational components.\n\nK. Supporting Management Policies and Programs\n\nIn all dealings with employees, the Group Supervisor firmly and effectively supports the national, regional, and district points of view on policies and programs.\n\nL. Performing Administrative Functions and Special Duties\n\nThe Group Supervisor performs or provides for handling of administrative matters related to the group's operations, including such matters as maintenance of time and attendance records, handling of grievances or improper conduct matters, planning and scheduling of leave, control and approval of travel, maintaining safe working conditions and caring for property.\n\nIII. LINES OF RESPONSIBILITY :\n\nA. The Field Audit Group Supervisors is under the general direction of and reports to the Revenue District Officer, who has line responsibility over him.\n\nB.

This Revenue Administrative Order is being prescribed in order to further improve the over-all system of investigation of taxpayers for their tax liabilities by the fieldmen of the bureau in line with effective and progressive tax administration. There have been reports regarding multiple, overlapping and unreasonably frequent investigations of taxpayers. These practices destroy the cordial bureau-taxpayer relationship which is of paramount importance if the bureau expects to succeed in its mission of increased revenue collections. This relationship based on respect, understanding and cooperation is essential to effective tax administration. Hence, all efforts should be exerted to maintain and enhance it. cdphil\n\nB. This order is, therefore, aimed to insure the realization of the following objectives:\n\n1. To provide and insure a fair, equitable and adequate method of assignment of tax returns, cases and dockets for purposes of investigation;\n\n2. To prevent or minimize multiple and/or repeated tax investigations;\n\n3. To consolidate pertinent provisions of orders, circulars, and memoranda into one order to facilitate implementation and to provide a reference manual on the matter;\n\n4. To update and improve outmoded provisions of orders, circulars, and memoranda regarding the assignment and distribution of tax returns, cases and dockets to the fieldmen;\n\n5. To provide a more effective supervision and control over the conduct of investigations and the reporting of the results thereof;\n\n6. To fix responsibilities; and\n\n7. To provide a complete recording system.\n\nII.   Schedule of Investigations.\n\nA. The ordinary investigation or examination of the taxpayer's books of accounts shall be conducted only in accordance with the following:\n\n1. Income Tax \u2014 Once a year after the lapse of the due date for the payment of the second installment. It includes the investigation of the withholding tax on wages as well as the withholding tax provided for in Sections 53 and 54 of the National Internal Revenue Code, as amended.\n\nEmployers who are delinquent in filing their W-1, W-3 and alphabetical list shall also be investigated only once a year.\n\n2. Transfer Taxes \u2014 Once only after the return has been filed or after the lapse of the due date for filing.\n\n3. Specific Taxes \u2014 Once every six months including the ordinary stock-taking.\n\nRequests or applications for permits to engage in the business of manufacturing or dealing in articles subject to specific taxes may be investigated if necessary, prior to the issuance of the permit.\n\n4. Privilege Taxes on Business and Occupation \u2014 Once a year only in the case of privilege taxes, C-13 graduated fixed tax and percentage taxes.\n\n5. Documentary Stamp Tax \u2014 Simultaneously with the investigation of percentage tax, bank tax and insurance premium tax.\n\n6. Mining Taxes \u2014 Once a year.\n\n7. Tax on Banks \u2014 Once a year at the same time the income tax case is investigated.\n\n8. Tax on Receipts of Insurance Companies \u2014 Once a year at the time the income tax case is investigated.\n\n9. Franchise Taxes \u2014 Once a year after the return has been filed.\n\n10. Amusement Taxes \u2014 Once every semester or as often as may be necessary in case of special shows.\n\n11. Forest Charges \u2014 Once every semester.\n\n12. Fees for Sealing of weights and measures \u2014 Investigation is conducted by Deputy Provincial Treasurers.\n\n13. Firearms Tax \u2014 Once a year.\n\n14. Tobacco Inspection Fees \u2014 For every inspection made.\n\n15. Water Rentals \u2014 Once a year.\n\n16. Bookkeeping \u2014 Simultaneously with the investigation of any of the above-mentioned taxes.\n\n17. Narcotic Drugs \u2014 Once a year in the case of occupation taxes of doctors, dentists, pharmacists and nurses.\n\nFor narcotic drugs, as often as warranted by circumstances of each individual case. aisadc\n\n18. Residence Tax \u2014 Simultaneously with the investigation of income tax.\n\n19. Sugar tax \u2014 Once a year.\n\nB. To avoid duplication of and repetitions and unreasonably frequent investigations of taxpayers, all chiefs of investigating units, offices or divisions in the Bureau of Internal Revenue at national, regional or district level shall systematically plan an audit program of investigation for any particular period or year and devise a system of control and internal check for the successful execution of the said program. Accordingly, tax investigations shall be scheduled in advance. Assignments and workloads of fieldmen shall be equitably distributed and all investigations and examinations shall be continuously conducted, terminated and reported within the time limit allotted for the purpose. The guideposts in programming such investigations shall be the quality and quantity of work that should be accomplished and the respective capabilities of fieldmen conducting the investigations, in order to meet predetermined goals. The investigation and examination of the books shall be scheduled and conducted as can be possible at a time most convenient to the taxpayer.\n\nIII.   Delineation of Investigations\n\nTo avoid jurisdictional conflicts and in conformity with the provisions of Revenue Administrative Order No. 1-67, dated January 3, 1967, the subject matter of which is the reorganization and functions of the Bureau of Internal Revenue, the following are the cases to be investigated by the fieldmen assigned to the various investigating units.\n\nA. Special Operations Department\n\n1. Anti-Smuggling Division\n\na. To avoid conflicts in the issuance of authorities to investigate, the Anti-Smuggling Division shall issue authorities to investigate only on direct apprehensions by its fieldmen or those apprehensions by other agencies such as the Philippine Constabulary, Philippine Navy, Bureau of Customs and City and Municipal Policemen. It also includes those suspected or denounced for smuggling, if after the evaluation of the evidence gathered in the preliminary investigation previously approved by the Commissioner, there is substantial ground to warrant the investigation.\n\nb. The issuance of authority to investigate should be on a case to case basis instead of on a periodical or yearly basis, in order that the taxpayer cannot complain of harassment when an ordinary investigation is conducted by other units which are on a periodical or yearly basis.\n\nc. If in the course of the investigation no proof of smuggling has been established, the investigation of the same shall be discontinued. If authorities have been issued both by the Anti-Smuggling Division and the Revenue District Office, and the service of the latter is ahead of the former, a joint investigation should be conducted. In case smuggling has been proven, the investigation shall include all kinds of taxes for all the years involved.\n\nd. Nature of Cases\n\n(1) Cases involving real, technical and pure smuggling such as non-declaration, misclassification, misdeclaration, undervaluations of imported merchandise.\n\n(2) Violations of Republic Act 3137, otherwise known as the Embroidery Law.\n\n(3) Violations of Section 2.01 of the Customs and Tariff Code insofar as smuggling is concerned.\n\n(4) Taxpayers engaged in basic industries or in the manufacture of textiles insofar as the importations thereof involve smuggling.\n\n(5) Smuggling into the Philippines of \"blue-seal\" cigarettes and untaxpaid distilled spirits.\n\n(6) Violations of tax-exempt importations.\n\n2. Special Investigation Division\n\na. All cases wherein prima-facie fraud is established. But before an authority to investigate is issued for fraud purposes, a comprehensive preliminary investigation must be conducted. An intelligent evaluation of the data and evidence gathered should be made and only when there are very strong grounds to believe that fraud has been committed can the authority be issued. For this purpose the Deputy Commissioner of Internal Revenue as Chief Evaluating Officer and the Revenue Operations Head (Legal) and the Revenue Operations Head (Management Planning) as members shall evaluate the evidence, whether or not there is a prima facie case of fraud. If prima facie case of fraud is established they shall certify to the effect to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue to warrant and justify the issuance of the letter of authority to investigate. The criminal aspect of the case should be handled by the division. The assessment of the tax, if the case was initiated in the division, shall also be investigated by this division. Referrals from regional offices shall be investigated by this division insofar as the criminal aspect is concerned, but the assessment phase shall be left with the regional offices concerned. LLphil\n\nb. Investigation of taxpayers engaged in integrated or non-integrated industries (Republic Act 3029 and 4122) in connection with their applications under the said laws; follow-up investigations to determine whether the conditions of the permit granted are being followed by the taxpayer shall also be made by the division.\n\nc. Investigation of tax-exempt industries for purposes of granting the tax exemption or as a follow-up of the tax exemption granted.\n\nd. Investigation of interrelated industries where the industries interrelated are located in more than one region.\n\ne. Claims for refunds under Republic Acts Nos. 3127 and 4186, otherwise known as the Basic Industries Law and Textile Assistance Act, respectively.\n\nf. Investigation of transfer taxes wherever filed, where properties are located in Regional Offices 6, 7, 8 and other regions outside of the three preceding regional offices, where not less than 30% of the gross estate is located in other regions. However, if the gross estate exceeds P500,000.00, wherever the properties are located, the jurisdiction shall be with the division.\n\ng. For purposes of criminal prosecution, all cases coming from the International Operations Division, Anti-Smuggling Division, Assessment Department, Specific Tax Department and Regional Offices shall be under the jurisdiction of the National Tax Fraud Unit of the Special Investigation Division.\n\n3.

                                    "Details": "Since the launching by the Bureau of Internal Revenue of a workable and realistic personnel blue ribbon program which includes a performance rating system already effective as of January 1, 1967, as well as a merit promotion plan, qualification standards for all classes of revenue positions, and a position ranking system all of which are in the final stages of completion, the present existing Executive Selection Board has been slowly relegated to the background of personnel management activities. In the light also of prevailing conditions the need has arisen for the modification of the functions and membership composition of the Personnel Advisory Committee. Furthermore, with the strengthening of the personnel staff of the Bureau and the expected approval of the aforementioned personnel management tools, the activities of the Executive Selection Board have been rendered superfluous while the functions of the Personnel Advisory Committee have been consigned to a limited role and effectiveness. LLjur\n\nFor the abovestated reasons, the Executive Selection Board and the Personnel Advisory Committee are hereby respectively abolished and in their stead is hereby created a Personnel Advisory Council.\n\nFunctions and Responsibilities\n\nThe Personnel Advisory Council (hereinafter referred to as \"Council\") shall have the following functions and responsibilities:\n\n1. Evaluate, for the Commissioner, the merits, fitness as well as the degree of competence and qualification of candidates for appointment, transfer, or designation to all positions;\n\n2. Screen, for the Commissioner, officials or employees recommended and/or nominated to receive special training and/or training grants;\n\n3. Coordinate with other officials of the Bureau in the design and evaluation of training courses;\n\n4. Establish criteria and realistic standards for personnel development and selection where these are not specified;\n\n5. Interpret personnel rules and regulations and Bureau policies on personnel advancement, development and selection;\n\n6. Apply written qualification standards and position ranking system for personnel selection and promotion;\n\n7. Evaluate results of training programs conducted in the light of Bureau operations and plans; and\n\n8. Requisition any record relevant to cases under its deliberation, when necessary.\n\nThe decisions of the Council shall only be advisory in nature. Names of candidates selected for promotion, transfer, or designation shall be submitted to the Commissioner for final decision.\n\nMembership\n\nThe Council shall be composed of all Department Heads of the Bureau with the Revenue Operations Head (Management Planning) as chairman and the Revenue Operations Head (Administrative Services) as Vice-Chairman.\n\nIn the absence of any Department Head, his assistant will sit in his stead. The Chief and Assistant Chief, Personnel Division shall be the Executive Secretary and Assistant Executive Secretary, respectively, of the Council.\n\nA majority of the Revenue Operations Head present or their alternates attending a Council meeting shall constitute a quorum to do business.\n\nTo expedite the Council's deliberations, the Chairman may create special committees to study matters which require mature and intelligent judgment, delegate to the committee such powers upon such terms as he may deem fit and appoint the members thereof with any of the Council members as Chairman. Membership in any committee will be drawn from the Council members and, if necessary, from Assistant Revenue Operations Head. The function of any committee is, however, fact-finding and recommendatory in nature only.\n\nAny official of the Bureau may be invited to shed light on certain personnel matters under deliberation by the Council. A candidate for recruitment, training, appointment, or promotion or a protestant to an appointment and/or promotion may be called for interview by the Council or by any of its special committees. prcd\n\nTechnical Working Staff\n\nThe Chairman of the Council shall recommend to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue the creation of a technical working staff together with the names of those who shall compose the group, when he deems it necessary. The chairman may request the working staff, or any of its members, to work on a full time basis on Council matters, when necessary.\n\nRepealing Clause\n\nThis Order supersedes Revenue Administrative Order No. 6-66 and Revenue Administrative Order No. 7-66, both dated June 28, 1966.\n\nThis Order takes effect immediately. cdt\n\n(SGD.)

                                    "Details": "This Order prescribes the performance rating system for all officers and employees of the Bureau of Internal Revenue pursuant to the provision of Section 26 of R. A. 2260, Civil Service Rule IX and Civil Service Memorandum Circular No. 6, s. of 1963. cda\n\nI. Purpose\n\nThe performance rating system shall be continually administered to:\n\n1. Foster the improvement of individual employee performance by providing effective supervision and counseling through the identification of the employee's weak and strong points.\n\n2. Develop standards of satisfactory performance;\n\n3. Strengthen supervisor-employee relations; and\n\n4. Objectify the application of personnel policies in selection, placement, promotion, reduction in force and other processes of personnel administration.\n\nII. Scope\n\nThe Performance Rating System shall cover all officials below the rank of Deputy Commissioner, whether in the competitive or non-competitive service.\n\nIII. Policies\n\n1. This Performance Rating System is hereby made an integral part of the personnel program of this Bureau.\n\n2. Each employee shall be informed of his right and obligations under this System.\n\n3. In establishing performance requirements, whether written or oral, the views of the employee for whose position the requirements apply will be solicited and fully considered.\n\n4. The performance of each employee shall be evaluated fairly in relation to the performance requirements of his position.\n\n5. Each employee shall be kept currently advised of how his performance meets requirements and shall be notified of his performance rating.\n\n6. The strong qualities of employees shall be utilized in making work assignments insofar as possible.\n\n7. Employees shall be given appropriate recognition for the merit of their performance and their contribution to efficiency and economy in the operation of this Office. cdtai\n\nIV. Definition of Terms\n\n1. \"Performance Rating System\" is an orderly, systematic method of administering continuing appraisal, accurate recording and periodic reporting of employee performance.\n\n2. \"Rater\" is the supervisor who shall have the authority to rate his immediate subordinate.\n\n3. \"Ratee\" is the employee or officer being rated.\n\n4. \"Supervisor\" is the one who has actual and direct supervision over other employees, notwithstanding the title of his position.\n\n4. \"Next Higher Supervisor\" is the supervisor who has authority to review the ratings prepared by initial raters and who is next higher in rank to the latter in the organization hierarchy.\n\n6. \"Non-Supervisor\" is one who does not exercise actual and direct supervision over other personnel, notwithstanding the title of his position.\n\nV Performance Standards\n\n1. All employees shall be informed by their immediate supervisors what they are expected to do and how well they are expected to accomplish their jobs. This shall be done periodically with all employees and whenever an employee enters a new job. A discussion of that is to be done and how well it is to be done shall serve as the basis for continuing discussion of actual performance.\n\n2. Performance standards (what the employee is expected to do and how well he is expected to do it) will be prepared in writing by the supervisor and a copy will be furnished to the employee. See attachment A to this Administrative Order for the format to be used in developing written standards.\n\n3. In the development and discussion of written performance standards, the views of the employee will be solicited and fully considered.\n\n4. Performance standards should be established in terms reflecting satisfactory performance in these aspects which are necessary for the successful operation of the job. cdt\n\nVI Appraising and Discussing Performance\n\n1. The real value of the performance appraisal process is the day-to-day communication between the supervisor and employee. These discussions may vary from remarks on current accomplishments to general performance discussions.\n\n2. During these discussions the supervisor might cover (1) Performance standards (2) the degree to which the employee is meeting these standards (3) current projects to illustrate standards and performance, and (4) career development of the employee. Supervisors should encourage employees to indicate their career goals whenever appropriate and discuss the employees next probable assignment, his long range objectives, and what he plans to do, to better himself for advancement. A discussion of career development possibilities may be more stimulating to an employee than a review limited to past performance and can provide the supervisor with the opportunity to develop the employee's abilities in the present job.\n\n3. The content of such discussions should be varied from time to time and adapted to fit the current circumstances.\n\n4. Documentation of continuing discussions should be kept to a minimum. However, supervisors should periodically note those issues which they believe they may need to refer at a later date. For example, a supervisor may have observed one or more strengths or weaknesses which may affect a formal personnel action in the future, namely promotion, removal or recommendation of an award. Use of the Performance Evaluation Form _____, (Attachment B to this Administrative Order) for this purpose would save time for the supervisor particularly in preparing future evaluations for Outstanding and very satisfactory rating. High factor marking supported by narrative examples should have sufficient justifications for approving officials to determine whether an outstanding rating is merited.\n\nVII Rating Procedures\n\n1. Adjective ratings\n\nFour adjective ratings shall be used:\n\n(1) An Outstanding rating shall be given when performance not only materially exceeds all performance standards of the position but is unusual and deserving of special commendation.\n\n(2) A very satisfactory rating shall be given when performance exceeds the performance standards of the position in those aspects which are necessary for the successful operation of the job.\n\n(3) A satisfactory rating shall be given when performance meets the performance standards of the position in those aspects which are necessary for the successful operation of the job.\n\n(4) An unsatisfactory rating shall be given when performance fails to meet the performance standards of the position in one or more of those aspects which are necessary for the successful operation of the job.\n\n2. Frequency of ratings\n\n(1) Performance ratings shall be given semi-annually, one on June 30, for the January to June period and another on December 31 for the July to December rating period.\n\n(2) Female employees who go on maternity leave shall also be rated for the period when they render actual services. The inclusive period of their maternity leave shall not be deducted under the factor of attendance.\n\n(3) A probationary period rating shall be made at the end of the sixth month of employment of an employee on probationary status.\n\n(4) Ratings will be postponed if they fall due under the following circumstances:\n\na. Where the employee has served less than ninety (90) days in his present position his performance rating will be postponed until ninety (90) days shall have elapsed from the time he entered the duties of his present position.\n\nb. Performance rating of an employee on detail shall be given by his former supervisor in collaboration with supervisor of the Unit, Section or Division where he is presently detailed.\n\nc. When an official warning period for unsatisfactory performance has not expired, the employee will be given his rating at the end of the warning period.\n\nd. When the employee has not been performing satisfactorily but has not been given an official warning the supervisor will issue the warning immediately and rate the employee at the end of the warning period.\n\ne. When an employee is under suspension or has been notified of proposed suspension or other adverse action namely removal or demotion, within sixty (60) days following his return to duty from suspension, or withdrawal of a notice of proposed adverse action, the employee shall either be rated, or issued a 60 days warning for unsatisfactory performance if such warning has not already been issued. aisadc\n\n3. Who shall rate\n\n(1) The Deputy Commissioner of Internal Revenue shall rate Heads of Departments and Regional Directors, which ratings shall be subject to confirmation by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue.\n\n(2) Rating of all other employees shall be done by the employees' immediate supervisor.\n\n4. Assigning the rating\n\n(1) Supervisors will prepare Performance Evaluation Form _____ in triplicate at the end of the rating period for each eligible employee and will promptly notify employees of their assigned performance ratings.\n\n(2) Upon notification, supervisors will discuss the ratings with their employees. The discussion should include a follow-up and summary of the various evaluation meetings held with the employee during the rating period. In addition to evaluating the employee, the supervisor should recognize the ratee's good points and encourage him to describe what he thinks he has done well and what he would like to do better. The supervisor should develop a plan with each ratee which will help the ratee to do better in those aspects of the position in which there is room for improvement.\n\n(3) After the discussion the rater and ratee shall sign the Performance Evaluation Form _____ and note the date the rating was discussed.\n\n(4) The three copies of the rating shall then be forwarded by the rater to the reviewer for his review and/or concurrence. If a Very Satisfactory rating was assigned to the ratee, the rater will include a statement on the rating form or in an attachment thereto describing in what ways the ratee's performance exceeded the requirements of the position that justified the Very Satisfactory rating. Upon concurrence by the reviewer, one copy of the rating report shall be given to the ratee, one copy shall be kept in the corresponding unit or division and the original shall be sent to the Personnel Division.\n\n(5) If the evaluation calls for a rating of \"Outstanding\" the rater shall submit a written justification in detail for the rating as well as an additional copy of the accomplished performance rating form of the ratee concerned. If the ratee occupies a position below that of a department head or regional director the rating shall be reviewed by a committee composed of all department heads chaired by the Deputy Commissioner. After confirmation by this committee, or if the ratee is a Regional Director of Department Head, after approval by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, a copy of the performance rating report together with the supporting justifications shall be forwarded by the Personnel Division to the Commissioner of Civil Service thru the Honorable, the Secretary of Finance for comment and recommendation, for a possible incentive award. A copy of the report shall also be furnished the ratee with a letter of commendation from the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. If the committee does not approved the rating of \"Outstanding\" the file shall be returned to the rating official indicating the rating assigned to the ratee on the basis of the record. The committee shall also advise the ratee and the Personnel Division of its disapproval of the outstanding rating.\n\n(6) If on the evaluation of a rater, the employee falls below the performance standards of the position in one or more aspects which are necessary for the successful operation of the job, the following procedure shall be followed:\n\na. The rater shall give the employee a written warning of at least 60 calendar days containing a detailed explanation of the unsatisfactory performance.\n\nb. It shall be stated in the warning that the employee shall be given a rating of \"unsatisfactory\" unless his performance improves sufficiently to meet the standards for satisfactory performance or unless the improvement in performance indicates that these standards will be met within a reasonable period of time.\n\nc. The warning shall also indicate to the employee how he may improve his performance and that a reasonable opportunity for, and assistance in improving his performance shall be given to him.\n\nd. A copy of the warning shall be furnished the next higher supervisor or the chief of the organizational unit where the employee being warned belongs.\n\ne. If after the warning to the employee, his performance adequately improves and such improvement is maintained for a sufficient period of time, the rater shall assign a rating \"satisfactory\" to the ratee. However, if the employee's performance is not improved at the end of the warning period, the rater shall assign an \"unsatisfactory\" rating and shall recommend that the ratee be transferred, reassigned or separated from his position.\n\nVIII Appeals\n\n1. An employee who feels that he has not been rated fairly or properly may appeal through channels for review of his performance rating to the Grievance and Complaints Committee.\n\n2. The request for review shall be in writing and shall be made not later than the seventh day after receipt of his notice of evaluation of performance rating. cdta\n\nIX. Relationship between Performance Rating and Personnel Actions\n\nThe performance rating of employees shall be considered in connection with the following personnel actions:\n\n1. Placement \u2014 The strong qualities of employees shall be utilized in duty assignments insofar as possible.\n\n2. Promotion \u2014 A current rating of \"Satisfactory\" or better shall be a requirement for promotion.\n\n3. Incentive Award \u2014 An employee for whom an \"Outstanding\" rating is approved shall be recommended for an incentive award.\n\n4.

                                    "Details": "Program Objectives\n\nIn order to install carefully selected, high quality officials in executive positions in the Bureau, to insulate, in a sense, the Bureau of Internal Revenue from outside influences over appointments to key positions, and to develop and up-grade the skills of revenue officials for executive leadership so as to maintain a corps of good managers at the Bureau's helm, and at the same time lend meaning to the merit system of the Bureau,- there is hereby established an Executive Development and Selection Program. cdti\n\nTo carry out the objectives of the Program, there is hereby created an Executive Selection Board (hereinafter referred to as \"Board\").\n\nBoard Functions and Responsibilities\n\nThe main functions and responsibilities of the Board shall be to:\n\n1. Evaluate, for the Commissioner, the merit and potentialities of candidates for appointment, transfer or designation to positions with WAPCO allocations of Range 42 and above;\n\n2. Screen, for the Commissioner, officials to receive special training for executive positions;\n\n3. Coordinate with officials of the Bureau in designing executive training courses;\n\n4. Establish criteria or standards for executive development or selection where these are not pronounced or specified;\n\n5. Interpret personnel rules and regulations and Bureau policies on executive development and selection;\n\n6. Apply written qualification standards for positions within its concern;\n\n7. Evaluate results of executive training programs on Bureau operations and decisions;\n\n8. Call for any record relevant to cases under deliberation whenever such record is important and necessary for decision-making.\n\nBoard decisions are advisory in nature only. Names of candidates selected for promotion, transfer or designation to key positions shall be submitted to the Commissioner for final decision. cda\n\nBoard Composition\n\nTo represent a cross-section of mature, Bureau-wide judgment, the Board shall be composed of the Deputy Commissioner and all heads of departments in the Bureau as permanent members. Any regional director with jurisdiction over a position to be deliberate upon may be invited to serve on the Board as temporary member but his membership shall only be for the duration of the deliberation of such position.\n\nThe Deputy Commissioner shall be the Chairman of the Board. In the absence of the Chairman during meetings of the Board, the Revenue Operations Head (Assessment) shall preside.\n\nIn the absence of a Revenue Operations Head, his assistant will sit in the Board in the former's stead.\n\nThe Chief, Personnel Division shall be the Executive Secretary of the Board.\n\nTo expedite the deliberations of all matters that will come to the Board, the Chairman may appoint a committee or committees of not more than three (3) members each with any of the members of the Board as chairman and any assistant revenue operations head as a member thereof to study matters the Committee might decide to delegate. The function of the sub-committee is, however, fact finding in nature only.\n\nExecutive Training\n\nExecutive training courses shall be developed with the aim of creating a career executive corps for the Bureau. Those courses shall include classroom lectures readings, work situation exposures and field trips and such subjects as:\n\n\u2014 Management and administration, including personnel administration;\n\n\u2014 Broad principles of taxation;\n\n\u2014 Policies, programs, and operations of the BIR;\n\n\u2014 National, fiscal budget, and legislative processes.\n\nThe objective envisioned in these courses is not necessarily to make the trainees experts in the foregoing field but to give them a feel and appreciation for them. In general, it is intended to broaded their horizon and executive perspective. cdt\n\nThe period of training will be as long as necessary, during which time the participants will be completely detached from their regular positions. At the end of the training period, the participants will return to their regular positions.\n\nFor more intensive instructions, classes will be limited to 20-25 BIR trainees. The Finance Academy facilities may be used for the training.\n\nAfter the executive training program has been in operation for one or two years, the qualification standards for positions covered by the Executive Selection Board may be amended to include, as a requirement, successful completion of the executive training course.\n\nProcedure for Nominating Candidates\n\nCandidates for promotion to executive positions and executive training will be nominated by Department Heads and Regional Directors under set standards and procedures. These should be publicized Bureau-wide. Calls for candidates will be announced from time to time by the Commissioner.\n\nThis Order revokes Revenue Memorandum Order No. 46-65 and takes effect upon approval. cdasia\n\n(SGD.) MISAEL P.

THE ORGANIZATION OF THE BUREAU OF INTERNAL REVENUE SHOWING THE RELATION OF THE NATIONAL OFFICE TO LOWER OPERATING LEVELS AND OUTLINING THE FUNCTIONS OF EACH LEVEL.\n\nA: Functions of the Bureau of Internal Revenue in General.\n\nSubject to the continuing control, direction and supervision by the Secretary of Finance, the National Office of the Bureau of Internal Revenue is located in Manila. Its functions are confined to executive direction, nation-wide policy formulation and statistical controls. The set up of the Bureau of Internal Revenue is decentralized except for some limited operations. Its functions are characterized by the separation of staff and line responsibilities so that ordinarily a taxpayer has no direct contact with the Commissioner and members of his executive staff.\n\nThe mission of the National Office is to develop broad nationwide policies and programs for the administration of internal revenue laws, and to direct, guide and coordinate the endeavors of the Bureau of Internal Revenue.
