                                    "Details": "I. OBJECTIVES\n\nThis Order is being issued to effectively manage the collection of Accounts Receivable/Delinquent Accounts (AR/DAs) which have been increasing over the years in the National and Regional Offices. In order to intensify the collection enforcement activity by the AR/DAs handling Offices, there is a need to fully utilize the remedies provided for under Sections 206 and 207 of the Tax Code of 1997 (Code) as amended. In this light and with the institutionalization of the Arrears Management Section in the Revenue Regions who are in-charge of the collection functions, it is deemed proper to further update the delegation of authority and responsibility of revenue officials who shall sign, approve, serve and execute Warrants of Distraint, Levy/Garnishment, Notices of Tax Liens, Encumbrance, Levy and Seizures and Lifting of such Warrants and Notices.\n\nII. SCOPE\n\nThis Order shall cover the delegation of authority to sign/approve and serve/execute the following:\n\n1. Warrant of Distraint and/or Levy (WDL);\n\n2.

Background\n\nUnder Revenue Memorandum Order No. 26-2007, Regional Directors were authorized to transfer personnel with salary grade (SG) 1 to 17 within their jurisdiction. However, then Commissioner Sixto S. Esquivias IV temporarily suspended this delegated authority of the Regional Directors through the unnumbered memorandum dated April 20, 2009.\n\nII. Objectives\n\nThis order is issued to restore the delegated authority of the Regional Directors to transfer or re-assign revenue personnel with salary grade 17 and below under their respective jurisdictions. This will ensure the authority of the Regional Directors in the discharge of official functions on certain personnel matters and to expedite the processing of transfers within the Region in the exigency of the revenue service.\n\nIII. Delegated Authority to the Regional Director\n\nThe Regional Directors are hereby delegated with the authority to transfer or re-assign personnel with salary grade 17 and below under their respective administrative jurisdictions including regional divisions, except personnel assigned at the data units, Large Taxpayers District Office (LTDO) and Excise Taxpayers Area (EXTA).\n\nIn the discharge of this function, the following must be observed:\n\na) The variance (over and under) in the personnel strength of each office/unit shall not go beyond or be less than 10% of the authorized plantilla position of the office, thus maintaining a balance and equitable distribution of personnel.\n\nb) The capability of personnel to perform the job assignment in the office/work unit where they shall be transferred or reassigned must be considered.\n\nc) The revenue personnel's Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) shall be considered in the determination of their new place of assignment. EIAaDC\n\nd) Revenue personnel must have been assigned in his present place of assignment for at least six (6) months. The counting of the six months period should start from the date of reporting for duty and not from the date of the Revenue Travel Assignment Order (RTAO) or Regional Revenue Travel Assignment Order (RRTAO).\n\ne) Personnel who have not reported for duty pursuant to previously issued RTAO shall not be considered for transfer without approval from the Deputy Commissioner of the Resource Management Group.\n\nf) Revenue Officers assigned to perform assessment or collection function shall not remain in the same assignment for more than three (3) years pursuant to Sec. 17 of the Tax Code, subject to sub-paragraph (d) hereof. Pursuant to this rule, employees with the longest period of duty shall be the first to be transferred.\n\nThe Deputy Commissioner of the Resource Management Group (RMG) must be furnished a copy of the RRTAO issued not later than fifteen (15) days from date of issuance.\n\nAll requests for transfers not within the delegated authority of the Regional Directors, including transfers to and from different National or Regional Offices shall bear the written approval of the Concerned Heads of Office (RDOs/Division Chiefs and Regional Directors, both present and prospective) for submission to the Human Resource Development Service (HRDS) for evaluation and preparation of Revenue Travel Assignment Order (RTAO) for approval of the Commissioner.\n\nIV. Repealing Clause\n\nAll issuances or portion thereof not consistent with this order are hereby repealed or amended accordingly.\n\nV. Effectivity\n\nThis Order shall take effect immediately.\n\n(SGD.) JOEL L. TAN-TORRES\nCommissioner of Internal Revenue",

Objective. \u2014 Pursuant to Section 7 of the 1997 National Internal Revenue Code (Tax Code), as amended, the power to issue rulings of first impression or to reverse, revoke, or modify any existing ruling of the Bureau rests solely on the authority of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (Commissioner). Nevertheless, for issues or requests for rulings confirming tax exemptions, tax incentives, or tax treaty relief which have established precedents, the Tax Code, as amended, allows the Commissioner to delegate such authority to his subordinate officials.\n\nThis Order is issued to clarify and modify the scope of Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 37-2007 with respect to the delegation of authority to sign rulings that involve grants of tax exemptions to the Regional Directors, Assistant Commissioner-Legal Service (ACIR-Legal Service), and to the Deputy Commissioner for Legal and Inspection Group (DCIR-LIG).\n\nSECTION 2. Delegation of Authority. \u2014\n\n2.1 Regional Directors. \u2014\n\nThe following shall be under the authority of the Regional Directors (concurrent with the ACIR-Legal Service) for taxpayers falling under their respective jurisdiction:\n\n2.1.1 Tax exemption of senior citizens and persons with disability;\n\n2.1.2 Extension of time for the filing of estate tax return and payment of the estate tax under Sections 90 and 91 of the Tax Code, as amended;\n\n2.1.3 Use of pre-numbered loose-leaf forms, receipts, invoices and books of accounts (manual);\n\n2.1.4 Change of accounting period;\n\n2.1.5 Tax exemption of cooperatives under R.A. 6938, as amended.\n\nIn view of the concurrent authority given to the ACIR-Legal Service with respect to the above, taxpayers are given the option to file their request either with the Regional Director or the ACIR-Legal Service. However, to prevent the instances of \"forum-shopping\", if a request for ruling has already been filed with any one of these authorized Officials, the taxpayer is precluded from filing the same request with the other authorized Official. CHIScD\n\nCopies of all rulings signed by the Regional Directors, in accordance with the provisions of this Section shall be furnished to the Office of the Commissioner immediately upon issuance.\n\n2.2 ACIR-Legal Service. \u2014\n\nThe delegated authority of the ACIR-Legal Service to sign rulings that involve in any manner the granting, as well as, confirmation of tax exemptions and/or tax incentives, including tax treaty reliefs, with established precedents, shall be limited to the following:\n\n2.2.1 Tax exemption of accredited non-stock, non-profit organizations, under Sec. 30 of the Tax Code, as amended, as implemented by Revenue Regulations No. (RR) 13-98;\n\n2.2.2 Tax exemption on the sale or disposition of principal residence under RR 2-98, as amended by RR 17-2003;\n\n2.2.3 Tax exemption of Government-Owned and/or -Controlled Corporations under Sec. 27 of the Tax Code, as amended;\n\n2.2.4 Tax incentives of Private Sector participating in Socialized Housing Program and Community Mortgage Program under R.A. 7279, as implemented by RR 3-93 as amended by RR 11-97 and RR 17-2001;\n\n2.2.5 Exemption from donor's tax under Sec. 101 of the Tax Code, as amended;\n\n2.2.6 Exemption from income tax and, consequently, from withholding tax of \"de minimis\" benefits under RR 2-98, as last amended by RR 5-2008;\n\n2.2.7 Income tax exemption of retirement benefits under R.A. 7641 reasonable private benefit plans under R.A. 4917;\n\n2.2.8 Tax exemption of separation benefits of employees under RMO 25-91;\n\n2.2.9 Tax exemption of long term deposits;\n\n2.2.10 Tax-deferred exchanges of property for shares under Section 40 (C) (2) of the Tax Code, as amended, under RR 18-2001, RMO 32-2001, and RMR 1-2001;\n\n2.2.11 Transfer of property by a pre-need corporation to a trustee in accordance with SEC guidelines on the establishment of trusts by pre-need companies;\n\n2.2.12 Tax consequences of exchanges of properties made in order to correct mistakes of fact relating to ownership of subdivision lots;\n\n2.2.13 Topics covered by RMC 2-01 relative to the authority to sign VAT Exemption Certificate, Certificate of Income Tax Exemption, Certificate of Residency, and Certificate, of Registration as a Qualified Donee Institution;\n\n2.2.14 Topics covered by RMC 10-01 pertinent to the authority to sign denial of claim for informer's reward under Section 282 of the Tax Code, as amended, and issuance of disbursement voucher for informer's reward; CAHTIS\n\n2.2.15 VAT-zero rating of Freeport zones and Ecozone enterprises;\n\n2.2.16 Tax exemption of foreign governments, embassies and their employees, as well as the authority to sign the VAT Exemption Certificate/VAT exemption identification Card issued to qualified foreign embassies and their qualified personnel pursuant to RMO 22-2004;\n\n2.2.17 Tax exemption and issuance of Exemption Certificate of Securities Borrowing and Lending (SBL)/Securities Lending Transactions (SLT);\n\n2.2.18 Tax exemptions/incentives to inventors pursuant to R.A. 7459; and\n\n2.2.19 Authority to sign repetitive rulings where the BIR has maintained a consistent position on the issue raised.

Moreover, the Commissioner may, motu propio, reverse, modify, or revoke any such ruling issued within the delegated authority of the Regional Director, ACIR-Legal Service or the DCIR-LIG, at any time after its issuance if he determines that the same is not in accordance with established precedent rulings or pertinent tax laws and revenue issuances, but after due notice to the concerned taxpayers, and in accordance with Section 246 of the Tax Code, as amended, without prejudice, however, to administrative sanctions relative to such actions.\n\nThe foregoing is without prejudice to the applicability of Revenue Bulletin No. 1-2003 \u2014 No Ruling Areas-001.\n\nSECTION 3. Rulings Issued Outside the Scope of Delegated Authority. \u2014 Rulings involving tax exemptions, incentives or reliefs found to have been issued outside the scope of the delegated authority given to the aforementioned Officials are void ab initio, hence, considered invalid without need of revocation by the Commissioner.\n\nAll rulings issued outside the scope of the delegated authority granted under this Circular and all other issuances on the delegation of authority issued by all previous Commissioners shall also be deemed invalid and without any force or effect, and thus, all the taxes and penalties that may be due thereon shall become due and payable from the time of the issuance of the unauthorized ruling.\n\nSECTION 4. Resolution of Multiple Issues. \u2014 The resolution of issues on request for ruling filed containing multiple issues falling under the jurisdictional authorities of two different Officials shall be vested upon the Higher Official.\n\nIn cases where the request for ruling contains multiple issues which partly involve those with established precedents and partly those of first impression, the concerned subordinate Official having jurisdiction over those with established precedents is barred from resolving the issues under the authority of the Commissioner, otherwise, that portion of the ruling issued by said concerned subordinate Official shall be considered null and void.\n\nSECTION 5. Interpretation of Claims for Exemptions. \u2014 All claims and requests for tax exemptions, incentives, and reliefs must be duly represented in writing and strictly evaluated based on best evidence obtainable. Any doubt must be resolved in favor of the Government.\n\nSECTION 6.

Authority of the Commissioner to Compromise or Abate Taxes.\n\nSection 204 of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997 (Code) provides for the authority of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) to compromise or abate the payment of any internal revenue taxes subject to certain conditions. Section 7 of the same Code, however, which provides for the power of the CIR to delegate some of his functions, prohibits the delegation of his power to compromise or abate any tax liability under certain instances to wit \u2014 EScHDA\n\n\"Sec. 7. Authority of the Commissioner to Delegate Power. \u2014 The Commissioner may delegate the powers vested in him under the pertinent provisions of this Code to any of such subordinate officials with the rank equivalent to a division chief or higher, subject to such limitations and restrictions as may be imposed under rules and regulations to be promulgated by the Secretary of Finance, upon recommendation of the Commissioner: Provided, however,That the following powers of the Commissioner shall not be delegated:\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(c) The power to compromise or abate, under Sec. 204(A) and (B) of this Code, any tax liability: Provided, however,That the assessments issued by the regional offices involving basic deficiency taxes of Five hundred thousand pesos (P500,000) or less, and minor criminal violations, as may be determined by rules and regulations to be promulgated by the Secretary of Finance, upon recommendation of the Commissioner, discovered by regional and district officials, may be compromised by a regional evaluation board which shall be composed of the Regional Director as Chairman, the Assistant Regional Director, the heads of the Legal, Assessment and Collection Divisions and the Revenue District Officer having jurisdiction over the taxpayer, as members:\n\nxxx xxx xxx.\"\n\nBased on the above-mentioned provisions, the approval or denial of the application for Abatement cannot be delegated to any other Bureau official. Such being the case, the signing and approval/disapproval of the recommendation/final report of tax cases which is the subject of application for Abatement shall be the sole authority of the CIR.\n\nThe term \"abatement\" as implemented by the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) pursuant to existing laws and regulations applies to cancellation of surcharge, interest and other penalties imposed on the taxpayer and not to cancellation of any portion of the basic tax assessed.\n\nFor Compromise Settlement, approval of the application for Compromise on deficiency taxes assessed by the regional offices amounting to Five hundred thousand pesos (P500,000) or less, may be delegated to the Regional Evaluation Board. However, for all other cases, the approval of the application for Compromise shall be the sole authority of the CIR and is covered by the general prohibition on non-delegation of the power of the CIR to compromise tax liability. Provided, however, that where the basic tax exceeds One million pesos (P1,000,000) or where the settlement offered is less than the prescribed minimum rates (10% for cases of financial incapacity; 40% for cases of doubtful validity of the assessment),the compromise shall be subject to the approval of the National Evaluation Board (NEB),composed of the CIR and the Deputy Commissioners of the BIR.\n\nII. Delegated Authority\n\nThe signing/approval of the CIR on the recommendation/final report on the application for Abatement being the final act of approving/disapproving such application shall still be the sole authority of the CIR. However, any succeeding certification to document/prove the approval or disapproval of the same can be properly delegated. IDESTH\n\nIn order, therefore, to expedite the disposition of tax cases which are the subject of application for Abatement, the signing of the Termination Letter or Letter of Denial/Notice of Disqualification, as the case may be, notwithstanding the provisions of Revenue Memorandum Order No. 23-2006 and other issuances to the contrary, is hereby delegated to the following officials:\n\nFor Compromise Settlement cases, recommendation/final report on the application shall be signed/approved as herein-stated:\n\nAs there was no prohibition on the delegation of the signing of the certification documenting/proving the approval/disapproval of the application, the signing of the Termination Letter or the Letter of Denial/Notice of Disqualification is hereby delegated to the following:\n\nThe aforesaid Termination Letter or Letter of Denial/Notice of Disqualification shall only be signed by the delegate after the recommendation/final report has been signed/approved by the concerned REB/CIR/NEB, as the case may be. cAaTED\n\nIII.
