DPC Bldg., BIR National Office Compound\nDiliman, Quezon City\n\nAttention: AAA\n_______________\n\nGentlemen :\n\nThis refers to your letter dated April 29, 2021 requesting on behalf of BIR Savings and Loan Association, Inc. (\"BIRSALA\") for a confirmatory ruling on whether or not, a non-stock savings and loan association organized and operated exclusively for the mutual benefit of its members is subject to gross receipts tax (GRT) under Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 09-2016.\n\nIt is represented that BIRSALA with Taxpayer's Identification No. (TIN) 000-000-000-000 and Certificate of Registration No. OCN 3AU0000998200, is a corporation duly organized under the laws of the Philippines; that it is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under Company Registration No. 37665; and that a Certificate of Authority No. C-041 was issued by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) in favor of BIRSALA authorizing the latter to operate as a Non-Stock Savings and Loan Association (NSSLA) under Republic Act (RA) No. 8367.\n\nBIRSALA is organized as a non-stock and non-profit savings and loan association and its primary purpose is to engage in the operations of a non-stock savings and loan association; to receive savings and time deposits from its members and to pay interest on said deposits at such rates as may be allowed by Central Bank rules and regulations; to extend loans to members and/or make investments in the securities of productive enterprises or in securities of the Government or any of its political subdivisions, instrumentalities or corporations; and generally to exercise and execute all the powers, prerogatives and privileges inherent in and granted to corporations and to such savings and loan associations, primarily for the benefit and interest of its members. [1]\n\nIn reply, please be informed that Section 3 of Republic Act (RA) No. 8367 otherwise known as \"An Act Providing for the Regulation of the Organization and Operation of Non-Stock Savings and Loan Associations\" defines non-stock savings and loan associations (NSSLAs) as \"a non-stock, non-profit corporation engaged in the business of accumulating the savings of its members and using such accumulations for loans to members to service the needs of households by providing long term financing for home building and development and for personal finance.\" Section 4 thereof provides that NSSLA shall confine its membership to a well-defined group of persons and shall not transact business with the general public. CHTAIc\n\nSection 4101S.1 of BSP Manual of Regulations for NSSLA enumerates membership for NSSLAs as a well-defined group which consists of employees, officers, and directors of one company, including member-retirees; government employees belonging to the same department, branch, office; including member-retirees; and; immediate members of the families of the abovementioned, up to the second degree of consanguinity or affinity. Likewise, Section 4101S of the BSP Manual requires that a NSSLA shall accept deposit from and grant loans to its members only and shall not transact business with the general public.\n\nR.A. No. 8367 also provides tax exemption to NSSLAs as provided under Section 5, to wit:\n\n\"SECTION 5. TAX EXEMPTION. \u2014 An Association shall be exempt from payment of tax in respect to income it receives, including interest on its deposits with any bank: Provided, however, that income derived from any of its properties, real or personal, or any activity conducted for profit, regardless of the disposition thereof, is subject to the corresponding internal revenue taxes imposed under the National Internal Revenue Code. Interest earnings on deposits of members with Associations as well as the shares of its members from the net income of the Associations shall be exempt from income tax.\"\n\nAccordingly, Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) Revenue Memorandum Circular (RMC) No. 9-2016 was issued to clarify the taxability of NSSLAs for purposes of income tax, gross receipts tax and documentary stamp tax. The said RMC provides that NSSLAs are under the direct supervision and regulation of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) and, for regulatory purposes, they are classified as Non-Bank Financial Intermediaries (NBFIs) under the BSP Manual of Regulations. Hence, NSSLA is generally subject to GRT on income derived from its operations, unless otherwise exempted under special rules. The GRT imposed is under Section 122 of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) of 1997, as amended, i.e., tax on other NBFIs.\n\nRelative thereto, Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 9-2004, entitled \"Implementing Certain Provisions of Republic Act No. 9238, Re-Imposing the Gross Receipts Tax (GRT) on Banks and Non-Bank Financial Intermediaries Performing Quasi-Banking Functions and Other Non-Bank Financial Intermediaries Beginning January 1, 2004\" defines NBFIs as follows:\n\n\"2.3. Non-bank Financial Intermediaries \u2014 shall refer to persons or entities whose principal functions include the lending, investing or placement of funds or evidences of indebtedness or equity deposited with them, acquired by them or otherwise coursed through them, either for their own account or for the account of others. This includes all entities regularly engaged in the lending of funds or purchasing of receivables or other obligations with funds obtained from the public through the issuance, endorsement or acceptance of debt instruments of any kind for their own account, or through the issuance of certificates of assignment or similar instruments with recourse, trust certificates, or of repurchase agreements, whether any of these means of obtaining funds from the public is done on a regular basis or only occasionally.\"\n\nFurther, in the case of City of Davao and Bella Linda N. Tanjili vs. Randy Allied Ventures, Inc., G.R. No. 241697, July 29, 2019, the Supreme Court held that:\n\n\"In order to be considered as an NBFI under the National Internal Revenue Code, banking laws, and pertinent regulations, the following must concur: EATCcI\n\na. The person or entity is authorized by the BSP to perform quasi-banking functions;\n\nb. The principal functions of said person or entity include the lending, investing or placement of funds or evidences of indebtedness or equity deposited to them, acquired by them, or otherwise coursed through them, either for their own account or for the account of others; and\n\nc. The person or entity must perform any of the following functions on a regular and recurring, not on an isolated basis, to wit:\n\n1. Receive funds from one (1) group of persons, irrespective of number, through traditional deposits, or issuance of debt or equity securities; and make available/lend these fund to another person or entity, and in the process acquire debt or equity securities;\n\n2. Use principally the funds received for acquiring various types of debt or equity securities;\n\n3. Borrow against, or lend on, or buy or sell debt or equity securities.\"\n\nClearly, the imposition of GRT is on NBFIs engaged in the lending of funds or purchasing of receivables or obligations with funds obtained from the public. On the other hand, RA No. 8367 and the BSP Manual of Regulations for NSSLA mandate that a NSSLA shall accept deposit from and grant loans to its members only and shall not transact business with the general public. Not only that, NSSLAs must be organized and operated exclusively for the mutual benefit of its members. RA No. 8367 requires that all funds received from members are accumulated to be utilized for the common benefit of the members by providing long term financing for home building and development and for personal finance.\n\nBased thereon, since BIRSALA showed that it is a NSSLA, a non-profit organization, which obtains funds exclusively from its members and does not transact business with the general public, it is our considered view that GRT imposed under RMC No. 9-2016 on its lending activities is not warranted for as long as such transactions do not fall under the contemplated activities of a NBFI as defined by law and its rules and regulations.\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be disclosed that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R. DULAY\nCommissioner of Internal Revenue\n\n1. Amended Articles of Incorporation of the BIR Savings and Loan Association, Inc.",

Entertainment, Inc.\nAgus Road\nMarigondon, Lapu-lapu City\nMactan Island, Cebu 6015\n\nAttention: Ms. Maria Gloria E. Leyson\nPresident\n\nGentlemen :\n\nThis refers to your letters dated August 22, 2019 and November 11, 2019 requesting for confirmation that as PAGCOR contractee/licensee, Eun K. Entertainment, Inc. (\"Eun K.\" or \"the Company\") shall pay 5% franchise tax on its income from gaming operations in lieu of all taxes [including value-added tax (VAT) and income tax] pursuant to Section 13 (2) (b) of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1869.\n\nAs represented, Eun K. is a 100% Filipino-owned domestic corporation duly registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on November 16, 2011 under SEC Reg. No. CS201130407. Its primary purpose is to engage in, conduct and operate sports, amusement parks and attractions, recreational facilities and similar establishments within or outside the Philippines. The Company's principal place of business is located at Agus Road, Barangay Marigondon, Lapu-lapu City. HTcADC\n\nOn February 12, 2012, the Company entered into an agreement with the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation (PAGCOR) whereby Eun K. as agent/contractee of PAGCOR was granted the authority to conduct \"junket gaming operations\" together with PAGCOR at Mactan Isla Resort and Spa compound, Lapu-lapu City, for a period of three (3) years.\n\nOn August 4, 2015, Eun K. entered into another agreement to still operate the same \"junket gaming operations\" for another period of three (3) years from October 17, 2015 to October 16, 2018. On August 2, 2018, the Board of Directors of PAGCOR approved the renewal of Eun K.'s authority to conduct the same \"junket gaming operations.\" A Junket Agreement [1] was then made and entered into by and between PAGCOR and Eun K. effective for a period of three (3) years commencing on October 17, 2018. On July 31, 2019, a Certificate of Authority was issued by PAGCOR authorizing Eun K. to conduct junket operations in its gaming facility located at Agus Road, Marigondon, Lapu-lapu City, Mactan Island, Cebu, valid until October 16, 2021. Since day one of Eun K.'s \"junket gaming operations,\" the Company has been religiously paying income taxes. As a contractee/licensee of PAGCOR, it is your opinion that Eun K. instead should have paid 5% franchise tax.\n\nIn reply, please be informed that Section 13 (2) (b) of PD No. 1869, as amended by Republic Act (RA) No. 9487, provides, viz.:\n\n\"SEC. 13. Exemptions. \u2014\n\n(2) Income and other taxes \u2014 (a) Franchise Holder: No tax of any kind or form, income or otherwise, as well as fees, charges or levies of whatever nature, whether National or Local, shall be assessed and collected under this Franchise from the Corporation, nor shall any form of tax or charge attach in any way to the earnings of the Corporation, except a Franchise Tax of five (5%) percent of the gross revenue or earnings derived by the Corporation from its operation under this Franchise. Such tax shall be due and payable quarterly to the National Government and shall be in lieu of all kinds of taxes, levies, fees or assessments of any kind, nature or description, levied, established or collected by any municipal, provincial, or national government authority.\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(b) Others: The exemption herein granted for earnings derived from the operations conducted under the franchise, specifically from the payment of any tax, income or otherwise, as well as any form of charges, fees or levies, shall inure to the benefit of and extend to corporation(s),association(s),agency(ies),or individual(s) with whom the Corporation or operator has any contractual relationship in connection with the operations of the casino(s) authorized to be conducted under this Franchise and to those receiving compensation or other remuneration from the Corporation or operator as a result of essential facilities furnished and/or technical services rendered to the Corporation or operator.\" (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)\n\nIn the more recent case of Prime Investment Korea, Inc. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, CTA EB No. 2129, January 8, 2021,the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA),citing the decision of the Supreme Court En Banc in the case of Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation (PAGCOR) v. The Bureau of Internal Revenue, et al., G.R. No. 215427, December 10, 2014,noted that PAGCOR is subject to: (1) the 5% franchise tax on income from its operations conducted under its Franchise (i.e.,gambling casinos, gaming clubs and other similar recreation or amusement places, gaming pools) in lieu of all taxes; and (2) income tax on income from \"other related services\" (i.e.,income from licensed private casinos, and bingo covered by authorities to operate issued to private operators).The court clarified that under the aforesaid decision, income from junket operations is classified as \"other related services\" and is subject to corporate income tax and not franchise tax and that since PAGCOR is subject to corporate income tax for other related services, contractees and licensees should also pay the same tax for income from such related services.\n\nWith regard to the VAT exemption of Eun K., Section 109 (1) (K) of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997 (Tax Code), as amended, provides: aScITE\n\n\"SEC. 109. Exempt Transactions. \u2014 (1) Subject to the provisions of Subsection (2) hereof, the following transactions shall be exempt from the value-added tax:\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(K) Transactions which are exempt under international agreements to which the Philippines is a signatory or under special laws,except those under Presidential Decree No. 529;\" (Emphasis supplied)\n\nPremises considered, this Office hereby rules that the income derived by Eun K.,an agent/contractee of PAGCOR, from its junket gaming operations is considered as \"other related services\" subject to corporate income tax and VAT.\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be ascertained that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R.

Bagumbayan, Quezon City 1110\n\nAttention: AAA\n_______________\n\nGentlemen :\n\nThis refers to your request for a ruling that the joint venture between E.M. Cuerpo, Inc. and Multi-System Construction and Development Corporation (E.M. Cuerpo, Inc./Multi-System Construction-Joint Venture), formed for the purpose of undertaking the Design and Build of the MWSS Multi-Level (4 Levels, Roof Deck Included) Parking Building, with Contract No. MWSS-MLP-2019 (\"JV Project\"), is exempt from the two percent (2%) creditable withholding tax pursuant to Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 14-2002, as amended by RR No. 11-2018. HTcADC\n\nDocuments submitted disclosed that E.M.

Cuerpo, Inc./Multi-System Construction-Joint Venture was registered with the BIR, as a regular taxable corporation liable for corporate income tax, and was issued with TIN _____________. Hence, this request.\n\nIn reply, please be informed that pursuant to Section 22 (B) of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997 (Tax Code), as amended, the term \"corporation\" shall include partnerships, no matter how created or organized, joint stock companies, joint accounts (cuentas en participacion), association or insurance companies, but does not include general professional partnerships and a joint venture or consortium formed for the purpose of undertaking construction projects or engaging in petroleum, coal, geothermal and other energy operations pursuant to an operating or consortium agreement under a service contract with the Government.\n\nLikewise, Section 2.57.5 (5) of RR No. 2-98, as amended, provides that:\n\n\"SECTION 2.57.5. Exemption from Withholding. \u2014 The withholding of creditable withholding tax prescribed in these Regulations shall not apply to income payments made to the following:\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(B) Persons enjoying exemption from payment of income taxes pursuant to the provisions of any law, general or special, such as but not limited to the following:\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(5) Joint ventures or consortium formed for the purpose of undertaking construction projects or engaging in petroleum, coal, geothermal and other energy operations pursuant to an operating or consortium agreement under a service contract with the government. Provided, however, joint ventures or consortium formed for the purpose of undertaking construction projects shall comply with the following conditions to be considered as joint venture not taxable as a corporation:\n\na) Should involve joining or pooling of resources by licensed local contractors; that is, licensed as general contractor by the Philippine Contractors Accreditation Board (PCAB) of the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI);\n\nb) These local contractors are engaged in construction business; and\n\nc) The Joint Venture itself must likewise be duly licensed as such by the PCAB of the DTI.\" (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)\n\nMoreover, Section 3 of RR No. 10-2012, implementing Section 22 (B) of the Tax Code, states that:\n\n\"SEC. 3. Joint Ventures Not Taxable as Corporations. \u2014 A joint venture or consortium formed for the purpose of undertaking construction projects which is not considered as corporation under Section 22 of the NIRC of 1997 as amended, should be:\n\n(1) for the undertaking of a construction project; and\n\n(2) should involve joining or pooling of resources by licensed local contractors that is, licensed as general contractor by the Philippine Contractors Accreditation Board (PCAB) of the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI);\n\n(3) the local contractors are engaged in construction business; and\n\n(4) the Joint Venture itself must likewise be duly licensed as such by the Philippine Contractors Accreditation Board (PCAB) of the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI).\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\nAbsent any one of the aforesaid requirements, the joint venture or consortium formed for the purpose of undertaking construction projects shall be considered as taxable corporations. In addition, the tax-exempt joint venture or consortium as herein defined shall not include those who are mere suppliers of goods, services or capital to a construction project.\n\nThe members to a Joint Venture not taxable as corporation shall each be responsible in reporting and paying appropriate income taxes on their respective share to the joint ventures profit.\"\n\nSuch being the case, the E.M. Cuerpo, Inc./Multi-System Construction-Joint Venture formed for the purpose of undertaking the Design and Build of the MWSS Multi-Level (4 Levels, Roof Deck Included) Parking Building, with Contract No. MWSS-MLP-2019 is considered a joint venture not taxable as a corporation for complying with the conditions provided in RR No. 10-2012, i.e., (1) the Joint Venture is for the undertaking of construction project; (2) the Joint Venture involves joining or pooling of resources by licensed local contractors (licensed as general contractor by the PCAB); (3) the local contractors are engaged in construction business; and (4) the Joint Venture itself is duly licensed by PCAB; and therefore not subject to the corporate income tax under Section 27 (A) of the Tax Code, as amended.\n\nFurthermore, the gross payments to the E.M. Cuerpo, Inc./Multi-System Construction-Joint Venture on the JV Project are likewise not subject to the 2% creditable withholding tax prescribed under Section 57 (B) of the same Code, as implemented by RR No. 2-98, as amended.\n\nE.M. Cuerpo, Inc./Multi-System Construction-Joint Venture, being exempt from corporate income tax, is not required to file quarterly and final adjustment returns.\n\nHowever, the co-venturers are separately subject to the regular corporate income tax imposed under Section 27 (A) of the Tax Code, as amended, on their taxable income during each taxable year respectively derived by them from the aforesaid construction project. (BIR Ruling No. 1421-18 dated December 7, 2018)\n\nIt should be emphasized that the respective net income of the co-venturers derived from the JV Project is subject to the creditable withholding tax imposed under Section 57 of the Tax Code, as amended, and implemented by RR No. 2-98, as amended. Thus, before E.M. Cuerpo, Inc./Multi-System Construction-Joint Venture distributes the net income to the co-venturers, pursuant to their agreed profits/income sharing, it shall withhold the tax based on the net income of its co-venturers and remit the same to the BIR. (BIR Ruling No. 1421-18 dated December 7, 2018)\n\nFinally, the co-venturers are required to enroll themselves to the Bureau of Internal Revenue's Electronic Filing and Payment System (eFPS). The enrollment should be done at the Revenue District Office (RDO) where they are registered as taxpayers. [1]\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be disclosed that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void. aScITE\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R.

On November 26, 2012 PPCI and the Absorbed Corporations entered into a Plan of Merger, with PPCI as the Surviving Corporation, wherein the effective date of the merger is the approval of the SEC.\n\n12. The stockholders of the said corporations approved such merger, for the following business purposes:\n\na. Considering the complementary business of the constituent corporations, the merger becomes necessary and advantageous for the integration of the administrative facilities, and to streamline and to simplify operations.\n\nb. It would allow the integration of administrative functions thereby eliminating the duplication of functions, resulting in greater efficiency and economy in the management of their operations and make possible the more productive use of their combined properties.\n\nc. Consolidation of the assets will allow the procurement of financing and credit facilities under more favorable terms.\n\n13. On February 26, 2013, SEC approved the Plan of Merger and the Articles of Merger of the constituent corporations and issued the Certificate of Filing of the Plan and Articles of Merger on the same date.\n\n14. Under the said approved Plan of Merger, the Absorbed corporations shall exchange all its assets, net of liabilities and obligations for such number of common shares of the Surviving Corporation (PPCI), of which the stockholders of the constituent corporations resolved to issue a total of 16,911,162 shares in favor of the stockholders of the absorbed corporation, thereby amending the total number of issued shares to all PPCI stockholders from 2,766,406,050 common shares to 2,783,317,212 common shares at a par value of P1.00 each share.\n\nBased on the foregoing representations, you now request confirmation of your opinion that \u2014\n\n1. The merger of PPCI and the absorbed corporations is a tax-free merger under Section 40 (C) (2) and (6) (b) of the NIRC, such that no gain or loss shall be recognized for income tax purposes;\n\n2. The transfer of assets by the Absorbed Corporations to PPCI pursuant to the merger is not subject to value-added tax (VAT) and any unused input tax of the Absorbed Corporations as of the effective date of the merger is absorbed by PPCI, as the Surviving Corporation;\n\n3. The transfer of assets by the Absorbed Corporations to PPCI is likewise not subject to donor's tax for lack of donative intent on the part of the Absorbed Corporations;\n\n4. The transfer of assets to PPCI is not subject to documentary stamp tax (DST) under Section 199 (m) of the NIRC, as amended by Republic Act (RA) No. 9243;\n\n5. Any excess creditable withholding tax (CWT) of the Absorbed Corporations is transferred to and vested in PPCI, as the Surviving Corporation, and such excess CWT may be utilized by the latter; and\n\n6. The original issuance of PPCI shares to the stockholders of the Absorbed Corporations is subject to DST at the rate of One Peso (P1.00) [1] on each Two Hundred Pesos (P200.00), or fractional part thereof.\n\nIn reply thereto, please be informed, as follows:\n\n1. The foregoing merger of PPCI and the Absorbed Corporations is a merger within the contemplation of Section 40 (C) (2) (a) in relation to 40 (C) (6) (b) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, because PPCI shall acquire/assume all the assets and liabilities of the Absorbed Corporations and the same will result in economies of scale and efficiency of operations of the merging corporations, allow the procurement of financing and credit facilities under more favorable terms, and make possible the more productive use of the properties of the constituent corporations, albeit, to the best interest of their respective stockholders. Hence, the merger of PPCI and the Absorbed Corporations is being undertaken for a bona fide business purpose and not for the purpose of escaping the burden of taxation.\n\nThe merger of PPCI and the Absorbed Corporations qualifies for non-recognition of gain or loss for income tax purposes in accordance with Section 40 (C) (2) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, such that no gain or loss shall be recognized by the Absorbed Corporations, as the transferor of all assets and liabilities, to PPCI pursuant to the Plan of Merger.\n\nAccordingly, no gain or loss shall be recognized by PPCI, as the transferee, on its receipt of the assets and liabilities of the Absorbed Corporations pursuant to and as a consequence of the merger.\n\nOn the other hand, the bases of the shares of stocks to be received by the shareholders of the Absorbed Corporations upon the exchange shall be the same as the bases of the properties, stocks or securities exchanged, decreased by (1) the money received, and (2) the fair market value of the other property/ies received and increased by (a) the amount treated as dividend of the shareholders and (b) the amount of any gain that was recognized in the exchange. (Sec. 40 (C) (5) (a) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended)\n\nThe basis of the properties transferred in the hands of the transferee (PPCI) shall be the same as it would be in the hands of the transferors increased by the amount of the gain, if any, recognized to the transferors on the transfer. (Sec. 40 (C) (5) (b), supra)\n\nFinally, if the amount of the liabilities assumed plus the amount of the liabilities to which the property is subject exceed the total of the adjusted basis of the properties transferred pursuant to such exchange, then such excess shall be considered as a gain, on the part of the transferor, from the sale or exchange of a capital asset or of property which is not a capital asset, as the case may be. (Sec. 40 (C) (4) (b), supra)\n\nThe substituted basis of the properties transferred by the Absorbed Corporations to PPCI shall comply with the rule that cash and other cash items will be excluded from the computation of the adjusted basis of the properties transferred for purposes of determining whether liabilities assumed and to which the property is subject do not exceed the adjusted basis of the property transferred pursuant to No. IV (A) (2) of Revenue Memorandum Ruling (RMR) No. 2-2002 dated June 10, 2002.\n\nAccordingly, the allocated shares and liabilities, and the substituted basis of the assets transferred by the Absorbed Corporations to PPCI, based on the Absorbed Corporations' audited financial statements as of July 31, 2012 shall be as follows:\n\nAmount\n(in Php)\n\nAllocated Liabilities\n\nAllocated Shares\n\nSubstituted Basis (in Php)\n\nCash and Cash-in-Bank\n\nReceivables\n\nMerchandise Inventories\n\nDue from related parties\n\nInput tax\n\nPrepaid Expenses and other current assets\n\nProperty and equipment\n\nSoftware and licenses\n\nDeferred tax assets\n\nSecurity deposit\n\nOther non-current assets\n\nInvestment in Subsidiaries\n\nTotal\n\nLiabilities\n\nAmount\n(in Php)\n\nTrade and other payables\n\nAdvances from related parties\n\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses\n\nSubscription Payable\n\nDue to related parties\n\nIncome tax payable\n\nNotes payable\n\nDeposit for future stock subscription\n\nOther current liabilities\n\nNon-current accrued rent\n\nRetirement benefits liability\n\nTOTAL\n\n2. Section 105 of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, identifies the persons liable for the Value-Added Tax. Thus,\n\n\"SECTION 105. Persons Liable. \u2014 Any person who, in the course of trade or business, sells, barters, exchanges, leases goods or properties, renders services, and any person who imports goods shall be subject to the value-added tax (VAT) imposed in Sections 106 to 108 of this Code.\n\nxxx xxx xxx.\"\n\nHowever, Section 4.106-8 (b) (3) of Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 16-2005, as amended by RR No. 4-2007, [2] specifically excludes mergers from being subject to output tax. Hence,\n\n\"SECTION 4.106-8. Change or Cessation of Status as VAT-registered Person. \u2014\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(b) Not subject to output tax.\n\nThe VAT shall not apply to goods or properties existing as of the occurrence of the following:\n\n(1) x x x\n\n(2) x x x\n\n(3) Merger or consolidation of corporations. The unused input tax of the dissolved corporation, as of the date of merger or consolidation, shall be absorbed by the surviving or new corporation.\"\n\nThus, the above-mentioned transaction shall not be subject to VAT, and any unused input VAT of the Absorbed Corporations as of the effective date of merger will be transferred to and absorbed by PPCI pursuant to Section 4.106-8 (b) (3) of RR No. 16-2005, as amended, the said transfer being considered a transaction \"not subject to output tax\" under the said Section.\n\n3. Well-settled in our jurisprudence is the fact that the essential elements of a valid donation are: (1) the reduction of the patrimony of the donor, (2) the increase in the patrimony of the donee, and (3) the intent to do an act of liberality (animus donandi).\n\nClearly, there is no intention on the part of the Absorbed Corporations to donate to PPCI their assets since the transaction is purely for legitimate business purpose. Thus, the aforesaid merger will not be subject to donor's tax since there is no intention to donate, and the transaction is a bonafide merger effected solely for business reasons.\n\n4. No DST is due on the transfer of assets made pursuant to the Plan of Merger under Section 199 (m) of the Tax Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 9243, in relation to Section 40 (C) (2) of the Tax Code, as amended. (BIR Ruling No. 100-2017 dated March 2, 2017)\n\nIn the case of Pilipinas Shell Petroleum Corporation vs. Commissioner of Internal Revenue (C.T.A. Case No. 6477 dated April 20, 2003), the Court stated that all the integral parts of the merger including the surrender of shares in exchange for shares, should be treated as a single and continuing transaction subject only to one DST. The Court held, as follows:\n\n\"As earlier stated, DST is in the nature of an excise tax because it is really imposed on the privilege to enter into a transaction. Its imposition, therefore, should be only once. And in a statutory merger, there is only one transaction, i.e., the issuance by the surviving corporation of its own shares of stock to the stockholders of the absorbed corporation in exchange for the shares surrendered by the shareholders of the absorbed corporation. All other transactions which are an integral and inherent part of the merger, such as the absorption of real property, should no longer be subject to another round of DST. In other words, all the integral parts of the merger (e.g., surrender of shares in exchange for shares, transfer of assets, assumption of liabilities, etc.) should be treated as a single and continuing transaction subject only to one DST. The transfer of real property is not a transaction separate and distinct from the merger but an integral part or a mere continuation of the initial transaction which was previously consummated.\"\n\n5. Any excess and unutilized creditable withholding taxes (CWT), which form part of the assets to be transferred by the Absorbed Corporations as of the effective date of the merger, shall be transferred to and vested in PPCI, as the surviving corporation, and such excess CWT may be utilized by the latter. (BIR Ruling No. 100-2017 dated March 2, 2017)\n\n6. DST at the rate of P1.00 [3] on each P200 par value, or fractional part thereof, shall be imposed on the original issuance of shares by PPCI to the stockholders of the Absorbed Corporations as a consequence of the merger as provided under Section 174 of the Tax Code, as amended.\n\n7. It is to be emphasized, however, that the net operating loss carry-over (NOLCO) under Section 34 (D) (3) of the Tax Code, as amended, and as implemented by Revenue Regulations No. 14-2001, of the Absorbed Corporations, if any, is not one of their assets that can be transferred and absorbed by the Surviving Corporation, PPCI, as this privilege or deduction can be availed of by the Absorbed Corporations only. Accordingly, the tax-free merger between the Absorbed Corporations and PPCI does not cover the NOLCO of the former.\n\n8. The excess and unexpired minimum corporate income tax (MCIT) of the Absorbed Corporations, as of the effective date of the merger, if any, shall be carried forward and credited against the normal income tax due of PPCI for the three (3) immediately succeeding taxable years pursuant to Section 27 (E) (2) of the Tax Code, as amended; and\n\n9. The retained earnings of the Absorbed Corporations are subject to the ten percent (10%) final withholding tax on dividends constructively received by its individual shareholders pursuant to Section 24 (B) (2) of the Tax Code. (BIR Ruling No. 1422-18 dated December 7, 2018)\n\nIn order that the above-described reorganization can be considered as merger under Section 40 (C) (2) and (6) (b) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, the parties to the merger should comply with the following requirements set forth under Revenue Regulations No. 18-2001:\n\nA. The plan of reorganization should be adopted by each of the corporations, parties thereto, the adoption being shown by the acts of its duly constituted responsible officers and appearing upon the official records of the corporation. Each corporation, which is a party to the reorganization, shall file, as part of its return for the taxable year within which the reorganization occurred a complete statement of all facts pertinent to the non-recognition of gain or loss in connection with the reorganization, including:\n\n1. A copy of the plan of reorganization, together with a statement executed under the penalties of perjury, showing in full the purposes thereof and in detail all transactions incident to, or pursuant to the plan;\n\n2. A complete statement of all cost or other basis of all property, including all stocks or securities, transferred incident to the plan;\n\n3. A statement of the amount of stock or securities and other property or money received from the exchange, including a statement of all distribution of other disposition made thereof. The amount of each kind of stock or securities and other property received shall be stated on the basis of the fair market value thereof at the date of the exchange;\n\n4. A statement of the amount and nature of any liabilities assumed upon the exchange, and the amount and nature of any liabilities to which any of the property acquired in the exchange is subject.\n\nB. Every taxpayer, other than a corporation, party to the reorganization, who received stock or securities and other property or money upon a tax-free exchange in connection with a corporate reorganization shall incorporate in his income tax return for the taxable year in which the exchange takes place a complete statement of all facts pertinent to the non-recognition of gain or loss upon such exchange, including:\n\n1. A statement of the cost or other basis of the stock or securities transferred in the exchange; and\n\n2. A statement in full of the amount of stock or securities and other property or money received from the exchange, including any liabilities assumed upon the exchange, and any liabilities to which property received is subject. The amount of each kind of stock or securities and other property (other liabilities assumed upon the exchange) received shall be set forth upon the basis of the fair market value thereof at the date of the exchange.\n\nC. Records in substantial form shall be kept by every taxpayer who participates in a tax-free exchange in connection with a corporate reorganization showing the cost or other basis of the transferred property or money received (including any liabilities assumed on the exchange, or any liabilities to which any of the properties received were subject), in order to facilitate the determination of gain or loss from subsequent disposition of such stock of securities and other property received from the exchange.\n\nIn addition to the foregoing requirements, the parties shall enclose with their respective income tax returns for the taxable year in which the merger occurred a copy of the request for ruling filed with, and the corresponding ruling issued by, the Bureau of Internal Revenue, both duly stamp-received by the appropriate office of the Bureau of Internal Revenue.\n\nSuch parties shall include as a note to their respective audited financial statements for the taxable year in which the merger occurred a statement to the effect that they hold such assets/shares acquired in a merger and the year in which such merger occurred, and in the taxable years until the subject properties are subsequently transferred to another transferee.\n\nMoreover, the shareholders of the Absorbed Corporation and the Surviving Corporation shall record in their respective books of accounts the mandatory accounting entries stated in Annex \"A\" hereof, pursuant to Revenue Memorandum Order (RMO) No. 17-2016.\n\nFurthermore, the parties shall cause to annotate at the back of the Transfer Certificates of Title (TCT) and Certificates of Stock of the properties transferred, the date the merger was executed, the original or historical cost of acquisition of the properties or shares of stock involved, and the fact that no gain or loss was recognized as a result of such merger, provided however, that any violation by the Register of Deeds or by the Corporate Secretary of this condition shall be penalized under Section 269 or 275, as the case may be, of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended.\n\nFinally, the parties are required to submit to the Law and Legislative Division, Bureau of Internal Revenue, proof of annotation of the substituted basis of the shares of stock and/or real properties involved in the transfer within ninety (90) days from receipt of this ruling. Violation of this requirement is subject to the penalties provided in Section 275 of the Tax Code of 1997.\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be disclosed that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R.

(PPCI) and Company E Corporation (CEC) is a tax-free merger in accordance with Section 40 (C) (2) and 6 (b) of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) of 1997, as amended.\n\nBackground\n\n1. PPCI, with Tax Identification Number (TIN) ________________ is a domestic corporation duly registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") under Registration No. ____________ with principal place of business at No. 900 Romualdez St., Paco, Manila, primarily engaged in the business of wholesale/retail of general merchandise, with an authorized capital stock of THREE BILLION (PhP3,000,000,000.00), Philippine currency, divided into THREE Billion (3,000,000,000) shares with a par value of ONE PESO (PhP1.00) per share; of which amount, TWO BILLION SEVEN HUNDRED SIXTY SIX MILLION FOUR HUNDRED SIX THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED SIX (2,766,406,406) shares with total par value of TWO BILLION SEVEN HUNDRED SIXTY SIX MILLION FOUR HUNDRED SIX THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED SIX TWO HUNDRED ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED SIX PESOS (PhP2,766,406,406) [*] were subscribed and fully paid up at the time of the merger herein contemplated.\n\n2. CEC, with TIN ________________, was a domestic corporation duly registered with the SEC under Registration No. ___________, with principal place of business at 122 Kalayaan Avenue, Diliman, Quezon City, primarily engaged in the business of trading of goods such as consumer goods on a wholesale/retail basis, with an authorized capital stock of FIFTY SIX MILLION PESOS (PhP56,000,000), Philippine currency, divided into FIVE HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND (560,000) shares with a par value of ONE HUNDRED PESOS (PhP100.00) per share; of which amount TWO HUNDRED NINETY THOUSAND (290,000) shares with total par value of TWENTY NINE MILLION PESOS (PHP29,000,000.00) were fully subscribed and paid up.\n\n3. On October 30, 2014 PPCI and CEC entered into a Plan of Merger, with PPCI as the Surviving Corporation, wherein the effective date of the merger is after the approval of the SEC.\n\n4. The stockholders of the said corporations approved such merger, for the following business purposes:\n\na) integration of administrative functions thereby eliminating the duplication of functions;\n\nb) greater efficiency and economy in the management of their operations;\n\nc) make possible the more productive use of their combined resources;\n\nd) consolidation of assets that will allow the procurement of financing and credit facilities under more favorable terms; and\n\ne) streamline and simplify operations with its existing clientele.\n\n5. On March 17, 2015, the SEC approved the Plan of Merger and the Articles of Merger of the constituent corporations.\n\n6. Under the said approved Plan of Merger, the CEC shall transfer all its assets, net of liabilities and obligations in exchange for such number of common shares of the Surviving Corporation (PPCI), of which the stockholders of the Surviving Corporation resolved to issue a total of 2,045,465 shares in favor of the stockholders of CEC, thereby amending the total number of issued shares to all PPCI stockholders from 2,766,406,406 common shares to 2,768,451,871 common shares at a par value of P10.00 each share.\n\nBased on the foregoing representations, you now request confirmation of your opinion that \u2014\n\n1. The described merger of PPCI and CEC is a tax-free merger under Section 40 (C) (2) and (6) (b) of the NIRC, such that no gain or loss shall be recognized for income tax purposes;\n\n2. The transfer of assets by CEC to PPCI pursuant to the merger is not subject to value-added tax (VAT) and any unused input tax of CEC as of the effective date of the merger is absorbed by PPCI, as the Surviving Corporation;\n\n3. The transfer of assets of CEC to PPCI is likewise not subject to donor's tax for lack of donative intent on the part of CEC;\n\n4. The transfer of assets of CEC to PPCI is not subject to documentary stamp tax (DST) under Section 199 (m) of the NIRC, as amended by Republic Act (RA) No. 9243;\n\n5. Any excess creditable withholding tax (CWT) of CEC is transferred to and vested in PPCI, as the Surviving Corporation, and such excess CWT may be utilized by the latter; and\n\n6. The original issuance of PPCI shares to the stockholders of CEC is subject to DST at the rate of One Peso (P1.00) [1] on each Two Hundred Pesos (P200.00), or fractional part thereof.\n\nIn reply thereto, please be informed, as follows:\n\n1. The foregoing merger of PPCI and CEC is a merger within the contemplation of Section 40 (C) (2) (a) in relation to 40 (C) (6) (b) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, because PPCI shall acquire/assume all the assets and liabilities of CEC and the same will result in economies of scale and efficiency of operations of the merging corporations, allow the procurement of financing and credit facilities under more favorable terms, and make possible the more productive use of the properties of the constituent corporations, albeit, to the best interest of their respective stockholders. Hence, the merger of PPCI and CEC is being undertaken for a bona fide business purpose and not for the purpose of escaping the burden of taxation.\n\nThe merger of PPCI and CEC qualifies for non-recognition of gain or loss for income tax purposes in accordance with Section 40 (C) (2) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, such that no gain or loss shall be recognized by CEC, as the transferor of all assets and liabilities, to PPCI pursuant to the Plan of Merger.\n\nAccordingly, no gain or loss shall be recognized by PPCI, as the transferee, on its receipt of the assets and liabilities of CEC pursuant to and as a consequence of the merger.\n\nOn the other hand, the bases of the shares of stocks to be received by the shareholders of CEC upon the exchange shall be the same as the bases of the properties, stocks or securities exchanged, decreased by (1) the money received, and (2) the fair market value of the other property/ies received and increased by (a) the amount treated as dividend of the shareholders and (b) the amount of any gain that was recognized in the exchange. (Sec. 40 (C) (5) (a) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended)\n\nThe basis of the properties transferred in the hands of the transferee (PPCI) shall be the same as it would be in the hands of the transferor increased by the amount of the gain, if any, recognized to the transferor on the transfer. (Sec. 40 (C) (5) (b), supra)\n\nFinally, if the amount of the liabilities assumed plus the amount of the liabilities to which the property is subject exceed the total of the adjusted basis of the properties transferred pursuant to such change, then such excess shall be considered as a gain, on the part of the transferor, from the sale or exchange of a capital asset or of property which is not a capital asset, as the case may be. (Sec. 40 (C) (4) (b), supra)\n\nThe substituted basis of the properties transferred by CEC to PPCI shall comply with the rule that cash and other cash items will be excluded from the computation of the adjusted basis of the properties transferred for purposes of determining whether liabilities assumed and to which the property is subject do not exceed the adjusted basis of the property transferred pursuant to No. IV (A) (2) of Revenue Memorandum Ruling (RMR) No. 2-2002 dated June 10, 2002.\n\nAccordingly, the allocated shares and liabilities, and the substituted basis of the assets transferred by CEC to PPCI, based on the Absorbed Corporation's audited financial statements as of July 30, 2014, shall be as follows:\n\nAmount\n(in Php)\n\nAllocated Liabilities\n\nAllocated Shares\n\nSubstituted Basis (in Php)\n\nCash\n\nReceivables\n\nMerchandise Inventories\n\nPrepaid Expenses and other current assets\n\nProperty and equipment\n\nDeferred tax assets\n\nOther non-current assets\n\nTotal\n\nLiabilities\n\nAmount\n(in Php)\n\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses\n\nIncome tax payable\n\nOther current liabilities\n\nNon-current accrued rent\n\nTOTAL\n\n2. Section 105 of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, identifies the persons liable for the Value-Added Tax. Thus,\n\n\"Section 105. Persons Liable. \u2014 Any person who, in the course of trade or business, sales, barters, exchanges, leases goods or properties, renders services, and any person who imports goods shall be subject to the value-added tax (VAT) imposed in Sections 106 to 108 of this Code.\n\nxxx xxx xxx.\"\n\nHowever, Section 4.106-8 (b) (3) of Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 16-2005, as amended by RR No. 4-2007, [2] specifically excludes mergers from being subject to output tax. Hence,\n\n\"SECTION 4.106-8. Change or Cessation of Status as VAT-registered Person. \u2014\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(b) Not subject to output tax.\n\nThe VAT shall not apply to goods or properties existing as of the occurrence of the following:\n\n(1) x x x\n\n(2) x x x\n\n(3) Merger or consolidation of corporations. The unused input tax of the dissolved corporation, as of the date of merger or consolidation, shall be absorbed by the surviving or new corporation.\"\n\nThus, the above-mentioned transaction shall not be subject to VAT, and any unused input VAT of the Absorbed Corporation as of the effective date of merger will be transferred to and absorbed by PPCI pursuant to Section 4.106-8 (b) (3) of RR No. 16-2005, as amended, the said transfer being considered as transaction \"not subject to output tax\" under the said Section.\n\n3. Well-settled in our jurisprudence is the fact that essential elements of a valid donation are: (1) the reduction of the patrimony of the donor, (2) the increase in the patrimony of the donee, and (3) the intent to do an act of liberality (animus donandi).\n\nClearly, there is no intention on the part of any of CEC to donate to PPCI their assets since the transaction is purely for legitimate business purpose. Thus, the aforesaid merger will not be subject to donor's tax since there is no intention to donate, and the transaction is a bona fide merger effected solely for business reasons.\n\n4. No DST is due on the transfer of assets made pursuant to the Plan of Merger under Section 199 (m) of the Tax Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 9243, in relation to Section 40 (C) (2) of the Tax Code, as amended. (BIR Ruling No. 100-2017 dated March 2, 2017)\n\nIn the case of Pilipinas Shell Petroleum Corporation vs. Commissioner of Internal Revenue (C.T.A. Case No. 6477 dated April 20, 2003), the Court stated that all the integral parts of the merger including the surrender of shares in exchange for shares, should be treated as a single and continuing transaction subject only to one DST. The Court held, as follows:\n\n\"As earlier stated, DST is in the nature of an excise tax because it is really imposed on the privilege to enter into a transaction. Its imposition, therefore, should be only once. And in a statutory merger, there is only one transaction, i.e., the issuance by the surviving corporation of its own shares of stock to the stockholders of the absorbed corporation in exchange for the shares surrendered by the shareholders of the absorbed corporation. All other transactions which are an integral and inherent part of the merger, such as the absorption of real property, should no longer be subject to another round of DST. In other words, all the integral parts of the merger (e.g., surrender of shares in exchange for shares, transfer of assets, assumption of liabilities, etc.) should be treated as a single and continuing transaction subject only to one DST. The transfer of real property is not a transaction separate and distinct from the merger but an integral part or a mere continuation of the initial transaction which was previously consummated.\"\n\n5. Any excess and unutilized creditable withholding taxes (CWT), which form part of the assets to be transferred by CEC as of the effective date of the merger, shall be transferred to and vested in PPCI, as the Surviving Corporation, and such excess CWT may be utilized by the latter. (BIR Ruling No. 100-2017 dated March 2, 2017)\n\n6. DST at the rate of P1.00 [3] on each P200 par value, or fractional part thereof, shall be imposed on the original issuance of shares by PPCI to the stockholders of the Absorbed Corporation as a consequence of the merger as provided under Section 174 of the Tax Code, as amended.\n\n7. It is to be emphasized, however, that the net operating loss carry-over (NOLCO) under Section 34 (D) (3) of the Tax Code, as amended, and as implemented by Revenue Regulations No. 14-2001, of CEC, if any, is not one of their assets that can be transferred and absorbed by the Surviving Corporation, PPCI, as this privilege or deduction can be availed of by CEC only. Accordingly, the tax-free merger between CEC and PPCI does not cover the NOLCO of the former.\n\n8. The excess and unexpired minimum corporate income tax (MCIT) of the absorbed corporation, as of the effective date of the merger, if any, shall be carried forward and credited against the normal income tax due of PPCI for the three (3) immediately succeeding taxable years pursuant to Section 27 (E) (2) of the Tax Code, as amended; and\n\n9. The retained earnings of CEC are subject to the ten percent (10%) final withholding tax on dividends constructively received by its individual shareholders pursuant to Section 24 (B) (2) of the Tax Code. (BIR Ruling No. 1422-18 dated December 7, 2018)\n\nIn order that the above-described reorganization can be considered as merger under Section 40 (C) (2) and (6) (b) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, the parties to the merger should comply with the following requirements set forth under Revenue Regulations No. 18-2001:\n\nA. The plan of reorganization should be adopted by each of the corporations, parties thereto, the adoption being shown by the acts of its duly constituted responsible officers and appearing upon the official records of the corporation. Each corporation, which is a party to the reorganization, shall file, as part of its return for the taxable year within which the reorganization occurred a complete statement of all facts pertinent to the non-recognition of gain or loss in connection with the reorganization, including:\n\n1. A copy of the plan of reorganization, together with a statement executed under the penalties of perjury, showing in full the purposes thereof and in detail all transactions incident to, or pursuant to the plan;\n\n2. A complete statement of all cost or other basis of all property, including all stocks or securities, transferred incident to the plan;\n\n3. A statement of the amount of stock or securities and other property or money received from the exchange, including a statement of all distribution of other disposition made thereof. The amount of each kind of stock or securities and other property received shall be stated on the basis of the fair market value thereof at the date of the exchange;\n\n4. A statement of the amount and nature of any liabilities assumed upon the exchange, and the amount and nature of any liabilities to which any of the property acquired in the exchange is subject.\n\nB. Every taxpayer, other than a corporation, party to the reorganization, who received stock or securities and other property or money upon a tax-free exchange in connection with a corporate reorganization shall incorporate in his income tax return for the taxable year in which the exchange takes place a complete statement of all facts pertinent to the non-recognition of gain or loss upon such exchange, including:\n\n1. A statement of the cost or other basis of the stock or securities transferred in the exchange; and\n\n2. A statement in full of the amount of stock or securities and other property or money received from the exchange, including any liabilities assumed upon the exchange, and any liabilities to which property received is subject. The amount of each kind of stock or securities and other property (other liabilities assumed upon the exchange) received shall be set forth upon the basis of the fair market value thereof at the date of the exchange.\n\nC. Records in substantial form shall be kept by every taxpayer who participates in a tax-free exchange in connection with a corporate reorganization showing the cost or other basis of the transferred property or money received (including any liabilities assumed on the exchange, or any liabilities to which any of the properties received were subject), in order to facilitate the determination of gain or loss from subsequent disposition of such stock of securities and other property received from the exchange.\n\nIn addition to the foregoing requirements, the parties shall enclose with their respective income tax returns for the taxable year in which the merger occurred a copy of the request for ruling filed with, and the corresponding ruling issued by, the Bureau of Internal Revenue, both duly stamp-received by the appropriate office of Bureau of Internal Revenue.\n\nSuch parties shall include as a note to their respective audited financial statements for the taxable year in which the merger occurred a statement to the effect that they hold such assets/shares acquired in a merger and the year in which such merger occurred, and in the taxable years until the subject properties are subsequently transferred to another transferee.\n\nMoreover, the shareholders of CEC and PPCI shall record in their respective books of accounts the mandatory accounting entries stated in Annex \"A\" hereof, pursuant to Revenue Memorandum Order (RMO) No. 17-2016.\n\nFurthermore, the parties shall cause to annotate at the back of the Transfer of Certificates of Title (TCT) and Certificates of Stock of the properties transferred, the date the merger was executed, the original or historical cost of acquisition of the properties or shares of stock involved, and the fact that no gain or loss was recognized as a result of such merger; provided however, that any violation by the Register of Deeds or by the Corporate Secretary of this condition shall be penalized under Section 269 or 275, as the case may be, of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended.\n\nFinally, the parties are required to submit to the Law and Legislative Division, Bureau of Internal Revenue, proof of annotation of the substituted basis of the shares of stock and/or real properties involved in the transfer within ninety (90) days from receipt of this ruling. Violation of this requirement is subject to the penalties provided in Section 275 of the Tax Code of 1997.\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be disclosed that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void.\n\nVery truly yours\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R. DULAY\nCommissioner of Internal Revenue",

On April 27, 2017, PPCI and the Absorbed Corporations entered into a Plan of Merger, with PPCI as the surviving corporation, wherein the effective date of the merger is the approval of the SEC.\n\n6. The stockholders of the said corporations approved such merger, or the following business purposes:\n\na) integration of administrative functions thereby eliminating the duplication of functions;\n\nb) greater efficiency and economy in the management of their operations;\n\nc) make possible the more productive use of their combined resources;\n\nd) consolidation of assets that will allow the procurement of financing and credit facilities under more favorable terms; and\n\ne) streamline and simplify operations with its existing clientele.\n\n7. On November 22, 2017, SEC approved the Plan of Merger and the Articles of Merger of the constituent corporations and issued the Certificate of Filing of the Plan and Articles of Merger on the same date.\n\n8. Under the said approved Plan of Merger, the Absorbed Corporations shall exchange all its assets, net of liabilities and obligations for such number of common shares of the Surviving Corporation (PPCI), of which the stockholders of the constituent corporations resolved to issue a total of 14,551,209 shares in favor of the stockholders of the Absorbed Corporations, thereby amending the total number of issued shares to all PPCI stockholders from 2,785,362,877 common shares to 2,799,914,086 common shares at a par value of P1.00 each share.\n\nBased on the foregoing representations, you now request confirmation of your opinion that \u2014\n\n1. The merger of PPCI and the Absorbed Corporations is a tax-free merger under Section 40 (C) (2) and (6) (b) of the NIRC, such that no gain or loss shall be recognized for income tax purposes;\n\n2. The transfer of assets by the Absorbed Corporations to PPCI pursuant to the merger is not subject to value-added tax (VAT) and any unused input tax of the Absorbed Corporations as of the effective date of the merger is absorbed by PPCI, as the Surviving Corporation;\n\n3. The transfer of assets by the Absorbed Corporations to PPCI is likewise not subject to donor's tax for lack of donative intent on the part of the Absorbed Corporations;\n\n4. The transfer of assets to PPCI is not subject to documentary stamp tax (DST) under Section 199 (m) of the NIRC, as amended by Republic Act (RA) No. 9243;\n\n5. Any excess creditable withholding tax (CWT) of the Absorbed Corporations is transferred to and vested in PPCI, as the Surviving Corporation, and such excess CWT may be utilized by the latter; and\n\n6. The original issuance of PPCI shares to the stockholders of the Absorbed Corporations is subject to DST at the rate of One Peso (P1.00) [1] on each Two Hundred Pesos (P200.00), or fractional part thereof.\n\nIn reply thereto, please be informed, as follows:\n\n1. The foregoing merger of PPCI and the Absorbed Corporations is a merger within the contemplation of Section 40 (C) (2) (a) in relation to 40 (C) (6) (b) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended because PPCI shall acquire/assume all the assets and liabilities of the Absorbed Corporations and the same will result in economies of scale and efficiency of operations of the merging corporations, allow the procurement of financing and credit facilities under more favorable terms, and make possible the more productive use of the properties of the constituent corporations, albeit, to the best interest of their respective stockholders. Hence, the merger of PPCI and the Absorbed Corporations is being undertaken for a bona fide business purpose and not for the purpose of escaping the burden of taxation.\n\nThe merger of PPCI and the Absorbed Corporations qualifies for non-recognition of gain or loss for income tax purposes in accordance with Section 40 (C) (2) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, such that no gain or loss shall be recognized by the Absorbed Corporations, as the transferor of all assets and liabilities, to PPCI pursuant to the Plan of Merger.\n\nAccordingly, no gain or loss shall be recognized by PPCI, as the transferee, on its receipt of the assets and liabilities of the Absorbed Corporations pursuant to and as a consequence of the merger.\n\nOn the other hand, the bases of the shares of stocks to be received by the shareholders of the Absorbed Corporations upon the exchange shall be the same as the bases of the properties, stocks or securities exchanged, decreased by (1) the money received, and (2) the fair market value of the other property/ies received and increased by (a) the amount treated as dividend of the shareholders and (b) the amount of any gain that was recognized in the exchange. (Sec. 40 (C) (5) (a) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended)\n\nThe basis of the properties transferred in the hands of the transferee (PPCI) shall be the same as it would be in the hands of the transferor increased by the amount of the gain, if any, recognized to the transferor on the transfer. (Sec. 40 (C) (5) (b), supra)\n\nFinally, if the amount of the liabilities assumed plus the amount of the liabilities to which the property is subject exceed the total of the adjusted basis of the properties transferred pursuant to such exchange, then such excess shall be considered as a gain, on the part of the transferor, from the sale or exchange of a capital asset or of property which is not a capital asset, as the case may be. (Sec. 40 (C) (4) (b), supra). The substituted basis of the properties transferred by the Absorbed Corporations to PPCI shall comply with the rule that cash and other cash items will be excluded from the computation of the adjusted basis of the properties transferred for purposes of determining whether liabilities assumed and to which the property is subject do not exceed the adjusted basis of the property transferred pursuant to No. IV (A) (2) of Revenue Memorandum Ruling (RMR) No. 2-2002 dated June 10, 2002.\n\nThe submitted basis of the properties transferred by the Absorbed Corporations to PPCI shall comply with the rule that cash and other cash items will be excluded from the computation of the adjusted basis of the properties transferred for purposes of determining whether liabilities assumed and to which the property is subject do not exceed the adjusted basis of the property transferred pursuant to No. IV (A) (2) of Revenue Memorandum Ruling No. 2-2002 dated June 10, 2002.\n\nAccordingly, the allocated shares and liabilities, and the substituted basis of the assets transferred by the Absorbed Corporations to PPCI, based on the Absorbed Corporations' audited financial statements as of December 31, 2016 shall be as follows:\n\nAmount\n(in Php)\n\nAllocated Liabilities\n\nAllocated Shares\n\nSubstituted Basis (in Php)\n\nCash and Cash-in-Bank\n\nReceivables\n\nMerchandise Inventories\n\nPrepaid Expenses and other current assets\n\nProperty and equipment\n\nIntangible Assets\n\nDeferred tax assets\n\nOther non-current assets\n\nTOTAL\n\nLiabilities\n\nAmount (in Php)\n\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses\n\nIncome tax payable\n\nDeposit for future stock subscription\n\nOther current liabilities\n\nNon-current accrued rent\n\nTOTAL\n\n2. Section 105 of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, identifies the persons liable for the Value-Added Tax. Thus,\n\n\"SECTION 105. Persons Liable. \u2014 Any person who, in the course of trade or business, sells, barters, exchanges, leases goods or properties, renders services, and any person who imports goods shall be subject to the value-added tax (VAT) imposed in Sections 106 to 108 of this Code.\n\nxxx xxx xxx.\"\n\nHowever, Section 4.106.8 (b) (3) of Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 16-2005, as amended by RR No. 4-2007, [2] specifically excludes mergers from being subject to output tax. Hence,\n\n\"SECTION 4.106-8. Change or Cessation of Status as VAT-registered Person. \u2014\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(b) Not subject to output tax.\n\nThe VAT shall not apply to goods or properties existing as of the occurrence of the following:\n\n(1) x x x\n\n(2) x x x\n\n(3) Merger or consolidation of corporations. The unused input tax of the dissolved corporation, as of the date of merger or consolidation, shall be absorbed by the surviving or new corporation.\"\n\nThus, the above-mentioned transaction shall not be subject to VAT, and any unused input VAT of the Absorbed Corporations as of the effective date of merger will be transferred to and absorbed by PPCI pursuant to Section 4.106-8 (b) (3) of RR No. 16-2005, as amended, the said transfer being considered a transaction \"not subject to output tax\" under the said Section.\n\n3. Well-settled in our jurisprudence is the fact that the essential elements of a valid donation are: (1) the reduction of the patrimony of the donor, (2) the increase in the patrimony of the donee, and (3) the intent to do an act of liberality (animus donandi).\n\nClearly, there is no intention on the part of any of the parties to the merger to donate to PPCI its assets since the transaction is purely for legitimate business purpose. Thus, the aforesaid merger will not be subject to gift tax since there is no intention to donate, and the transaction is a bonafide merger effected solely for business reasons.\n\n4. No DST is due to the transfer of assets made pursuant to the Plan of Merger under Section 199 (m) of the Tax Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 9243, in relation to Section 40 (C) (2) of the Tax Code, as amended. (BIR Ruling No. 100-2017 dated March 2, 2017)\n\nIn the case of Pilipinas Shell Petroleum Corporation vs. Commissioner of Internal Revenue (C.T.A. Case No. 6477 dated April 20, 2003), the Court stated that all the integral parts of the merger including the surrender of shares in exchange for shares, should be treated as a single and continuing transaction subject only to one DST. The Court held, as follows:\n\n\"As earlier stated, DST is in the nature of an excise tax because it is really imposed on the privilege to enter into a transaction. Its imposition, therefore, should be only once. And in a statutory merger, there is only one transaction, i.e., the issuance by the surviving corporation of its own shares of stock to the stockholders of the absorbed corporation in exchange for the shares surrendered by the shareholders of the absorbed corporation. All other transactions which are an integral and inherent part of the merger, such as the absorption of real property, should no longer be subject to another round of DST. In other words, all the integral parts of the merger (e.g., surrender of shares in exchange for shares, transfer of assets, assumption of liabilities, etc.) should be treated as a single and continuing transaction subject only to one DST. The transfer of real property is not a transaction separate and distinct from the merger but an integral part or a mere continuation of the initial transaction which was previously consummated.\"\n\n5. Any excess and unutilized creditable withholding taxes (CWT), which form part of the assets to be transferred by the Absorbed Corporations as of the effective date of the merger, shall be transferred to and vested in PPCI, as the surviving corporation, and such excess CWT may be utilized by the latter. (BIR Ruling No. 100-2017 dated March 2, 2017)\n\n6. DST at the rate of P1.00 [3] on each P200 par value, or fractional part thereof, shall be imposed on the original issuance of shares by PPCI to the stockholders of the Absorbed Corporations as a consequence of the merger as provided under Section 174 of the Tax Code, as amended.\n\n7. It is to be emphasized, however, that the net operating loss carry-over (NOLCO) under Section 34 (D) (3) of the Tax Code, as amended, and as implemented by Revenue Regulations No. 14-2001, of the Absorbed Corporations, if any, is not one of their assets that can be transferred and absorbed by the Surviving Corporation, PPCI, as this privilege or deduction can be availed of by the Absorbed Corporations only. Accordingly, the tax-free merger between the Absorbed Corporations and PPCI does not cover the NOLCO of the former.\n\n8. The excess and unexpired minimum corporate income tax (MCIT) of the Absorbed Corporations, as of the effective date of the merger, if any, shall be carried forward and credited against the normal income tax due of PPCI for the three (3) immediately succeeding taxable years pursuant to Section 27 (E) (2) of the Tax Code, as amended; and\n\n9. The retained earnings of the Absorbed Corporations are subject to the ten percent (10%) final withholding tax on dividends constructively received by its individual shareholders pursuant to Section 24 (B) (2) of the Tax Code. (BIR Ruling No. 1422-18 dated December 7, 2018)\n\nIn order that the above-described reorganization can be considered as merger under Section 40 (C) (2) and (6) (b) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, the parties to the merger should comply with the following requirements set forth under Revenue Regulations No. 18-2001:\n\nA. The plan of reorganization should be adopted by each of the corporations, parties thereto, the adoption being shown by the acts of its duly constituted responsible officers and appearing upon the official records of the corporation. Each corporation, which is a party to the reorganization, shall file, as part of its return for the taxable year within which the reorganization occurred a complete statement of all facts pertinent to the non-recognition of gain or loss in connection with the reorganization, including:\n\n1. A copy of the plan of reorganization, together with a statement executed under the penalties of perjury, showing in full the purposes thereof and in detail all transactions incident to, or pursuant to the plan;\n\n2. A complete statement of all cost or other basis of all property, including all stocks or securities, transferred incident to the plan;\n\n3. A statement of the amount of stock or securities and other property or money received from the exchange, including a statement of all distribution of other disposition made thereof. The amount of each kind of stock or securities and other property received shall be stated on the basis of the fair market value thereof at the date of the exchange;\n\n4. A statement of the amount and nature of any liabilities assumed upon the exchange, and the amount and nature of any liabilities to which any of the property acquired in the exchange is subject.\n\nB. Every taxpayer, other than a corporation, party to the reorganization, who received stock or securities and other property or money upon a tax-free exchange in connection with a corporate reorganization shall incorporate in his income tax return for the taxable year in which the exchange takes place a complete statement of all facts pertinent to the non-recognition of gain or loss upon such exchange, including:\n\n1. A statement of the cost or other basis of the stock or securities transferred in the exchange; and\n\n2. A statement in full of the amount of stock or securities and other property or money received from the exchange, including any liabilities assumed upon the exchange, and any liabilities to which property received is subject. The amount of each kind of stock or securities and other property (other liabilities assumed upon the exchange) received shall be set forth upon the basis of the fair market value thereof at the date of the exchange.\n\nC. Records in substantial form shall be kept by every taxpayer who participates in a tax-free exchange in connection with a corporate reorganization showing the cost or other basis of the transferred property or money received (including any liabilities assumed on the exchange, or any liabilities to which any of the properties received were subject), in order to facilitate the determination of gain or loss from subsequent disposition of such stock or securities and other property received from the exchange.\n\nIn addition to the foregoing requirements, the parties shall enclose with their respective income tax returns for the taxable year in which the merger occurred a copy of the request for ruling filed with, and the corresponding ruling issued by, the Bureau of Internal Revenue, both duly stamp-received by the appropriate office of the Bureau of Internal Revenue.\n\nSuch parties shall include as a note to their respective audited financial statements for the taxable year in which the merger occurred a statement to the effect that they hold such assets shares required in a merger and the year in which such merger occurred, and in the taxable years until the subject properties are subsequently transferred to another transferee.\n\nMoreover, the shareholders of the Absorbed Corporation and the Surviving Corporations shall record in their respective books of accounts the mandatory accounting entries stated in Annex \"A\" hereof, pursuant to Revenue Memorandum Order (RMO) No. 17-2016.\n\nFurthermore, the parties shall cause to annotate at the back of the Transfer Certificates of Title (TCT) and Certificates of Stock, the date the merger was executed, the original or historical cost of acquisition of the properties or shares of stock involved, and the fact that no gain or loss was recognized as a result of such merger; provided however, that any violation by the Register of Deeds or by the Corporate Secretary of this condition shall be penalized under Section 269 or 275, as the case may be, of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended.\n\nFinally, the parties are required to submit to the Law and Legislative Division, Bureau of Internal Revenue, proof of annotation of the substituted basis of the shares of stock and/or properties involved in the transfer within ninety (90) days from receipt of this ruling. Violation of this requirement is subject to the penalties provided in Section 275 of the Tax Code of 1997.\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be disclosed that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R.

Irawan, Puerto Princesa City, Palawan.\n\nLikewise, the acquisition of the said 500 residential socialized housing units shall be exempt from value-added tax (VAT) pursuant to Section 109 (1) (P) of the National Internal Revenue Code (Tax Code) of 1997, as amended, provided that the selling price thereof does not exceed P3,199,200.00 per house and lot package; provided further, that beginning January 01, 2021, the exemption from VAT shall only apply to sale of house and lot and other residential dwellings [1] with selling price of not more than P2,000,000.00, as adjusted in 2011 using the 2010 Consumer Price Index values. [2]\n\nHowever, the purchases of goods/articles by The One Dynamic Three Realty & Development Corporation shall be subject to VAT, even if the said purchases are to be used for the above-mentioned socialized housing project, since VAT is an indirect tax which can be passed on by the seller of the goods/services. It shall be understood that The One Dynamic Three Realty & Development Corporation must issue VAT-exempt official receipts on its gross receipts from the said socialized housing project.\n\nMoreover, the sale by the Landowner/s to The One Dynamic Three Realty & Development Corporation of the parcel of land described below, to wit:\n\nDate\n\nName of Landowner/s\n\nTransfer Certificate of Title No.\n\nTotal Area\n\nArea Transferred\n\nLocation\n\nJanuary 15, 2020\n\n1.

HTcADC\n\nBackground:\n\nThe Company is a domestic corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the Republic of the Philippines with current registered address at 5/F Makati Sky Plaza 6788 Ayala Avenue, Barangay San Lorenzo, Makati City. The Company is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) with Company Registration No. ______________ and with the BIR Tax Identification Number (TIN) _________________.\n\nThe primary purpose of the Company, as stated in its Articles of Incorporation (AOI), is as follows:\n\n\"To engage in the business of electronic money (\"e-money\") issuance and distribution insofar as the same may be allowed or permitted under existing laws, including such other services or activities that may be related or incidental to the business of e-money, such as but not limited to, bills payment, remittance, top-up services, mobile commerce, mobile payment, merchant acquiring, and such other payment, collection, and delivery services or facilities, for e-money and other similar products, whether offline or online through telecommunication systems or other electronic channels; provided that the foreign exchange currency transactions of the Corporation shall be limited to ordinary money changing activities or \"spot\" foreign currency transactions; provided further that the corporation shall not engage in the business of being a commodity futures broker of otherwise engage in financial derivatives activities such as foreign currency swaps, forwards, options or other similar instruments as defined under BSP Circular No. 102, series of 1995.\" (Underscoring supplied)\n\nConsistent with its primary purpose, the Company was granted approval by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) in a letter dated July 6, 2018 to undertake merchant acquiring activities. Moreover, pursuant to the BSP Manual of Regulations for Non-Bank Financial Institutions (MORNBFI), the Company was granted approval by the BSP to operate as a Remittance and Transfer Company (RTC) with a Type \"C\" E-Money Issuer (EMI) registration in letters dated November 27, 2017 and July 5, 2018, with Certificate of Registration bearing MSB Registration No. 53-0008-00-000.\n\nIn connection thereto, through a Local Asset Purchase Agreement (LAPA), the Company obtained Citibank N.A.'s merchant acquiring business. To date, the Company has only actively engaged in and earned revenues from its merchant acquiring activities. As can be seen in Note 14 in reference to Note 19 of the Company's Audited Financial Statements.\n\nAs a merchant acquirer, thru the use of the Point-of-Sale (POS) Terminals or credit card terminals, the Company secures authorization for credit or debit card transactions issued under various card associations, such as Visa or MasterCard. This allows consumers to make non-cash purchases from merchant/service establishments (M/SEs) using their cards. These purchases are supported by charge sales slips or credit card drafts, which the M/SEs shall periodically furnish to the Company. The Company shall, in turn, settle or pay the M/SEs the amounts reflected in the drafts less the fees payable to the respective card associations and card issuers, and the Merchant Discount Rate (MDR). The MDR or discount earned represents the Company's income in relation to its merchant acquiring activities in exchange of assuming credit risk after purchasing the M/SEs receivables.\n\nIn support of your request, you submitted copies of the Company's Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws; BSP's Approval of License to Operate as Electronic Money Issuer (EMI); BSP Certificate of Registration with MSB Registration No. ______________ issued on June 26, 2018; BSP's letter dated July 5, 2018 informing the Company of the approval of application to operate as a Remittance and Transfer Company pursuant to the Manual of Regulations for Non-Bank Financial Institutions (MORNBFI); and BSP letter dated July 6, 2018 approving the Company's request to undertake merchant acquiring activities.\n\nIn reply, please be informed that Section 2.3 of Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 9-2004 dated June 21, 2004 defines the term \"non-bank financial intermediary,\" to wit:\n\n\"SECTION 2. Definition of Terms. \u2014 For purposes of these Regulations, the terms enumerated hereunder shall have the following meaning:\n\n2.3. Non-bank Financial Intermediaries \u2014 shall refer to persons or entities whose principal functions include the lending, investing or placement of funds or evidences of indebtedness or equity deposited with them, acquired by them or otherwise coursed through them, either for their own account or for the account of others. This includes all entities regularly engaged in the lending of funds or purchasing of receivables or other obligations with funds obtained from the public through the issuance, endorsement or acceptance of debt instruments of any kind for their own account, or through the issuance of certificates of assignment or similar instruments with recourse, trust certificates, or of repurchase agreements, whether any of these means of obtaining funds from the public is done on a regular basis or only occasionally.\" (Emphasis supplied)\n\nIn relation thereto, Section 122 of the National Internal Revenue Code (Tax Code), of 1997, as amended by Republic Act (RA) No. 9238, imposes a percentage tax based on gross receipts derived from sources within the Philippines on financial intermediaries not performing quasi-banking functions, which are doing business in the Philippines, to wit:\n\n\"SECTION 122. Tax on Other Non-Bank Financial Intermediaries. \u2014 There shall be collected a tax of five percent (5%) on the gross receipts derived by other non-bank financial intermediaries doing business in the Philippines, from interest, commissions, discounts and all other items treated as gross income under this Code: Provided, That interests, commissions and discounts from lending activities, as well as income from financial leasing, shall be taxed on the basis of remaining maturities of the instruments from which such receipts are derived, in accordance with the following schedule: CAIHTE\n\nMaturity period is five (5) years or less \u2014 5%\n\nMaturity period is more than five (5) years \u2014 1%\n\nProvided, however, That in case the maturity period is shortened thru pretermination, then the maturity period shall be reckoned to end as of the date of pretermination for purposes of classifying the transaction and the correct rate shall be applied accordingly.\n\nProvided, finally, That the generally accepted accounting principles as may be prescribed by the Securities and Exchange Commission for other non-bank financial intermediaries shall likewise be the basis for the calculation of gross receipts.\n\nNothing in this Code shall preclude the Commissioner from imposing the same tax herein provided on persons performing similar financing activities.\" (Underscoring ours)\n\nFrom the above-quoted provisions of RR No. 9-2004 and Section 122 of the Tax Code, it is clear that GRT shall be imposed on persons, whether natural or juridical, as long as it is performing financing activities similar to a non-bank financing intermediary, such as the Company's purchase of receivables through its merchant acquiring activities.\n\nFurthermore, embraced in the definition of the term \"non-bank financial intermediaries\" are financing companies which refer to corporations except banks, investments houses, savings and loan associations, insurance companies, cooperatives, and other financial institutions organized or operating under other special laws, which are primarily organized for the purpose of extending credit facilities to consumers and to industrial, commercial, or agricultural enterprises, by direct lending or by discounting or factoring commercial papers or accounts receivables, or by buying and selling contracts, leases chattel mortgages, or other evidences of indebtedness, or by financial leasing of movable as well as immovable properties. (Sec. 2.7. Revenue Regulations No. 9-2004 citing R.A. No. 5980, as amended by R.A. No. 8556)\n\nIn BIR Ruling No. 005-2007 dated February 22, 2007, this Office ruled that an entity engaged in the business of investing and acquiring loans, receivables and other evidence of indebtedness is subject to GRT, since its activities are akin to the principal activities of non-bank financial intermediaries.\n\nIn view of the foregoing, given that the Company is engaged in the business of purchasing receivables through merchant acquiring and electronic money issuer (EMI) and registered as such with the BSP, it is considered as a nonbank financial intermediary.\n\nAccordingly, this Office holds that for business tax purposes, the Company shall be treated as Non-Bank Financial Intermediary performing activities similar to a financing company, provided that it does not perform any activity that entails the imposition of VAT. Consequently, revenues earned from its merchant acquiring activities shall be treated as gross income arising from its purchase or acquisition of receivables is subject to GRT imposed under Section 122 of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, and is exempt from VAT pursuant to Section 109 (1) (E) and (V) [1] of the same Code.\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be disclosed that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void. aScITE\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R. DULAY\nCommissioner of Internal Revenue\n\n1. As renumbered by Republic Act No. 10963 or the \"Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion (TRAIN).\"",

                                    "Details": "RA No. 9513; CIR vs. Team Energy, G.R. No. 230412\n\nStepasia, Inc.\n1100, 88 Corporate Center\nSede\u00f1o cor. Valero Sts.\nSalcedo Village, Makati City\n\nAttention: AAA\n_______________\n\nGentlemen :\n\nThis refers to your request for a confirmatory ruling on the following issues, to wit: HTcADC\n\n1. Whether or not a renewable energy developer (RE Developer) is required to obtain a Certificate of Compliance (COC) from the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) for its sales to be subject to zero-rated value-added tax (VAT); and,\n\n2. Whether or not the sales of the RE Developer during its commissioning and testing phase can be considered a VAT zero-rated sale for the purpose of VAT refund.\n\nAnent the first issue, please be informed that in the case of CIR vs. Team Energy Corporation, G.R. No. 230412 dated March 27, 2019, the Supreme Court had the occasion to clarify that in a claim for a VAT refund, a COC is required when the claim is anchored on Republic Act (RA) No. 9136 or the Electric Power Industry Reform Act (EPIRA). The pertinent portions of the aforesaid case is quoted hereunder, viz.:\n\n\"In Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Toledo Power Company which affirmed the said CTA decision, this Court essentially held that the requirements of the EPIRA must be complied with only if the claim for refund is based on EPIRA. The pertinent portion of the decision reads:\n\n'Now, as to the validity of TPC's claim, there is no question that TPC is entitled to a refund or credit of its unutilized input VAT attributable to its zero-rated sales of electricity to NPC for the taxable year 2002 pursuant to Section 108 (B) (3) of the NIRC, as amended, in relation to Section 13 of the Revised Charter of the NPC, as amended. Hence, the only issue to be resolved is whether TPC is entitled to a refund of its unutilized input VAT attributable to its sales of electricity to CEBECO, ACMDC, and AFC.\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\nSection 6 of the EPIRA provides that the sale of generated power by generation companies shall be zero-rated, Section 4 (x) of the same law states that a generation company \"refers to any person or entity authorized by the ERC to operate facilities used in the generation of electricity.\" Corollarily, to be entitled to a refund or credit of unutilized input VAT attributable to the sale of electricity under the EPIRA, a taxpayer must establish: (1) that it is a generation company, and (2) that it derived sales from power generation.\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\nIn this case, when the EPIRA took effect in 2001, TPC was an existing generation facility. And at the time the sales of electricity to CEBECO, ACMDC, and AFC were made in 2002, TPC was not yet a generation company under EPIRA. Although it filed an application for a COC on June 20, 2002, it did not automatically become a generation company. It was only on June 23, 2005, when the ERC issued a COC in favor of TPC, that it became a generation company under EPIRA. Consequently, TPC's sales of electricity to CEBECO, ACMDC, and AFC cannot qualify for VAT zero-rating under the EPIRA. 15 (Citations omitted)'\n\nIn the recent case of Team Energy Corporation v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, the Court likewise rejected the contention of the CIR that Team Energy is not entitled to tax refund or tax credit because it cannot qualify for VAT zero-rating for its failure to submit its ERC Registration and COC required under the EPIRA. In this case, the Court ruled:\n\nHere, considering that Team Energy's refund claim is premised on Section 108(B)(3) of the 1997 NIRC, in relation to NPC's charter, the requirements under the EPIRA are inapplicable. To qualify its electricity sale to NPC as zero-rated, Team Energy needs only to show that it is a VAT-registered entity and that it has complied with the invoicing requirements under Section 108(B)(3) of the 1997 NIRC, in conjunction with Section 4.108-1 of Revenue Regulations No. 7-95.\" (Underscoring supplied)\n\nAs discussed above, it is clear that a COC is relevant in the claim for VAT refund only when such claim is anchored on the EPIRA Law. It is well to state in this regard that in Revenue Memorandum Order (RMO) No. 47-2020 (dated November 24, 2020) [1] the documentary requirements to be submitted by taxpayers engaged in renewable energy on claims for VAT credit/refund under Section 108 (B) (7) of the 1997 Tax Code, as amended, [2] are the following, on a per transaction or project basis:\n\n(1) Photocopies of Certificate of Registration and Accreditation issued by the Department of Energy (DOE); and,\n\n(2) Certificate of Endorsement from the DOE, through the RE Management Bureau. DETACa\n\nIn addition, Section 18 of the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of Republic Act (RA) No. 9513, otherwise known as the \"Renewable Energy Act of 2008,\" requires for the availment of incentives and other privileges therein the registration of RE developers, and manufacturers, fabricators, and suppliers of locally-produced equipment with the Board of Investments (BOI). In both the RMO No. 47-2020 and the IRR of RA No. 9513, COC is not mentioned.\n\nGiven the pronouncement of the Court in CIR vs. Team Energy Corporation, supra, it would appear that if the claim for VAT refund is not anchored on EPIRA but on the NIRC of 1997, as amended, or the Renewable Energy Act of 2008 for that matter, COC is not one of those documents required to be submitted.\n\nOn the second issue of whether the sales of the RE Developer during its commissioning and testing phase can be considered a VAT zero-rated sale for the purpose of VAT refund, RA No. 9513 otherwise known as the \"Renewable Energy Act of 2008,\" provides:\n\n\"Section 15. Incentives for Renewable Energy Projects and Activities. \u2014 RE developers of renewable energy facilities, including hybrid systems, in proportion to and to the extent of the RE component, for both power and non-power applications, as duly certified by the DOE, in consultation with the BOI, shall be entitled to the following incentives:\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(g) Zero Percent Value-Added Tax Rate. \u2014 The sale of fuel or power generated from renewable sources of energy such as, but not limited to, biomass, solar, wind, hydropower, geothermal, ocean energy and other emerging energy sources using technologies such as fuel cells and hydrogen fuels, shall be subject to zero percent (0%) value-added tax (VAT), pursuant to the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) of 1997, as amended by Republic Act No. 9337.\"\n\nRelative thereto, Section 108 (B) (7) of the 1997 Tax Code, as amended, provides:\n\n\"SEC. 108. Value-Added Tax on Sale of Services and Use or Lease of Properties. \u2014\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(B) Transactions Subject to Zero Percent (0%) Rate \u2014 The following services performed in the Philippines by VAT-registered persons shall be subject to zero percent (0%) rate. aDSIHc\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(7) Sale of power or fuel generated through renewable sources of energy such as, but not limited to, biomass, solar, wind, hydropower, geothermal, ocean energy, and other emerging energy sources using technologies such as fuel cells and hydrogen fuels.\"\n\nBased on the above provisions, the sale of power or fuel generated through renewable sources of energy such as, but not limited to, biomass, solar, wind, hydropower, geothermal, ocean energy, and other emerging energy sources using technologies such as fuel cells and hydrogen fuels, is subject to zero percent VAT. Thus, as long as the power or fuel is generated through renewable sources of energy, the sale thereof is subject to zero percent VAT regardless of the stage of the operation of the RE Developer. However, while the law did not distinguish at what stage of the operation of the RE developer can it sell power that is entitled to zero percent VAT, this must be interpreted in conjunction with the Supreme Court decision in CIR vs. Team Energy Corporation, supra, where the Court held that for the purpose of claiming VAT refund based on the EPIRA, the RE Developer must have a COC before it can operate as RE Developer and be entitled to zero VAT rate on its sale of power generated from renewable sources of energy. Also, RE developer must be authorized to sell power generated from renewable sources of energy during commissioning and testing phase. On the other hand, given the pronouncement of the Court in CIR vs. Team Energy Corporation, supra, it would appear that if the claim for VAT refund is not based on EPIRA but based on the NIRC of 1997, as amended, or the Renewable Energy Act of 2008, no COC is needed.\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the facts and documents as represented and submitted. However, if upon investigation, the BIR ascertains that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R.

HTcADC\n\nDocuments submitted disclosed that COMELEC through their Special Bids and Awards Committee (SBAC) procured the services of LBC for the May 13, 2019 National Elections. The contract price amounted to _______________________________ (_______________) payable in four (4) payment schedules (Milestone) detailed as follows:\n\nMilestone\n\n%\n\nTotal\n\n1st After delivery of the Project Management Plan, Deployment Plan, Tracking and Monitoring System including training of COMELEC personnel involved in the Monitoring and inspection of provincial hubs/sub-hubs\n\n15\n\n2nd After delivery to Regional Hub/Warehouses\n\n30\n\n3rd After delivery of all equipment and peripherals for Final Testing and Sealing, and Election Day\n\n25\n\n4th After retrieval and reverse Logistics of AES/VRVS Equipment and Transmission Equipment\n\n30\n\nTotal\n\nAccording to the service contract, the contract price is inclusive of all taxes, insurance and other fiscal levies. [1] Likewise, the payment thereof shall be subject to deduction and retention of withholding and other deductible taxes in accordance with law. [2]\n\nPrior to the award, COMELEC obtained a BIR Ruling dated October 10, 2018, which exempts it from VAT on its local purchases of goods and services that will be used in the automated national and local elections.\n\nEventually, LBC billed COMELEC based on the agreed amount corresponding on the table below but received the payments, to wit:\n\nMilestone\n\nAgreed Amount\n\nAmount Paid\n\nDifference (Representing 12% VAT)\n\n1st\n\n2nd\n\n3rd\n\n4th\n\nTotal\n\nHence, LBC's request for confirmatory ruling.\n\nIn reply, this Office confirms that the COMELEC is exempt from the 12% value-added tax (VAT) on its local purchases of goods and services as well as VAT on its importation of goods that will be used in the automated national and local elections. This is in accordance to Section 12 of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 8436, [3] as amended, [4] viz.:\n\n\"Section 12. Procurement of Equipment and Materials. \u2014\n\nTo achieve the purpose of this Act, the Commission is authorized to procure, in accordance with existing laws, by purchase, lease, rent, or other forms of acquisition, supplies, equipment, materials, software, facilities and other services, from local or foreign sources free from taxes and import duties, subject to the accounting and auditing rules and regulations. With respect to the May 10, 2010 elections and succeeding electoral exercises, the system procured must have demonstrated capability and been successfully used in prior electoral exercise here or abroad. Participation in the 2007 pilot exercise shall not be conclusive of the system's fitness.\"\n\nAccordingly, the suppliers/sellers of goods and services to the COMELEC cannot shift or pass on any VAT to COMELEC on the latter's purchases of goods and services [5] that were actually used during the May 13, 2019 automated national and local elections. aScITE\n\nIt must be emphasized, however, that the exemption of the COMELEC from VAT is limited only to its purchases and/or importation of goods and services enumerated above beginning July 2018 until completion of the post-election activities; provided further, that the aforesaid purchases and/or importation of goods and services will be used in, or directly related to, the conduct of the May 13, 2019 automated elections. [6]\n\nTherefore, COMELEC shall no longer withhold and remit to BIR the five percent (5%) final withholding VAT mandated under Revenue Memorandum Order (RMO) No. 23-2014, by reason of Section 12 of R.A. 8436, as amended by R.A. 9369. Moreover, the operation of Section 4.114 (2) (a) of Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 16-2005, as amended by RR No. 13-2018, viz.:\n\n\"Sec. 4114-2. Withholding of VAT on Government Money Payments. \u2014 (a) The government or any of its political subdivisions, instrumentalities or agencies, including government-owned or controlled corporations (GOCCs) shall, before making payment on account of each purchase of goods and/or of services which are subject to the value-added tax imposed in Secs. 106 and 108 of this Code, deduct and withhold a final value-added tax at the rate of five percent (5%) of the gross payment thereof.\"\n\npro hac vice, finds no application to the transaction between COMELEC and LBC due to the exemption granted to the former predicated under R.A. No. 8436, as amended.\n\nInsofar as to who among the parties shall benefit from the savings derived on the grant of tax exemption, this Office is constrained to take cognizance of the matter as it is beyond its powers conferred by law. The parties should sit down together and settle the matter by reviewing the terms of the contract or by submitting the controversy to the authority of the Government Procurement Policy Board (GPPB) for proper adjudication.\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented.

HTcADC\n\nIt is represented that ASSATT CHRISTIAN SCHOOL, INC. with BIR Taxpayer's Identification No. (TIN) ________________ is a non-stock, non-profit association duly organized and existing under the laws of the Republic of the Philippines; and that it is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under Company Registration No. BN091001818.\n\nIn reply, please be informed that paragraph 3, Section 4, Article XIV of the 1987 Constitution states that:\n\n\"All revenues and assets of non-stock, non-profit educational institutions used actually, directly, and exclusively for educational purposes shall be exempt from taxes and duties.\"\n\nSimilarly, Section 30 (H) of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) of 1997, as amended, provides, viz.:\n\n\"Sec. 30. Exemptions from Tax on Corporations. \u2014 The following organizations shall not be taxed under this Title in respect to income received by them as such:\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(H) A non-stock and non-profit educational institution; x x x.\"\n\nMoreover, there are two requisites in order for a non-stock, non-profit educational institution to be exempt from tax as provided under Revenue Memorandum Order (RMO) No. 44-2016, to wit:\n\na) It is a non-stock, non-profit educational institution; and\n\nb) Its revenues are actually, directly and exclusively used for educational purposes.\n\n\"Non-stock\" means \"no part of its income is distributable as dividends to its members, trustees, or officers\" and that any profit \"obtained as an incident to its operations shall, whenever necessary or proper, be used for the furtherance of the purpose or purposes for which the corporation was organized.\" [1] \"Non-profit\" means that \"no net income or asset accrues to or benefits any member or specific person, with all the net income or assets devoted to the institution's purposes and all its activities conducted not for profit.\" [2]\n\nIn the submitted documents of ASSATT CHRISTIAN SCHOOL, INC.,it was disclosed that the Board of Trustees and Officers are entitled to allowances. The Treasurer's Affidavit/Certification states that the following amount of income, compensation, salaries are paid by the corporation to its corresponding Trustees, Officers, and other Executive Officers:\n\nNAME\n\nPOSITION\n\nSalaries/Income Emoluments as Officers of the Corporation\n\nBBB\n\n_________\n\n_________\n\nCCC\n\n_________\n\n_________\n\nDDD\n\n_________\n\n_________\n\nEEE\n\n_________\n\n_________\n\nFFF\n\n_________\n\n_________\n\nGGG\n\n_________\n\n_________\n\nHHH\n\n_________\n\nNone\n\nIII\n\n_________\n\nNone\n\nJJJ\n\n_________\n\nNone\n\nKKK\n\n_________\n\nNone\n\nLLL\n\n_________\n\nNone\n\nMMM\n\n_________\n\nNone\n\nThe giving of salaries or allowances to the members of the Board of Trustees is considered as distribution of equity (including the net income) of ASSATT CHRISTIAN SCHOOL, INC. This is a form of private inurement which the law prohibits in the organization and operation of a non-stock, non-profit corporation. This act violates the requirement that no part of the net income or assets of the corporation shall inure to the benefit of any individual or specific person. Thus, ASSATT CHRISTIAN SCHOOL, INC. cannot be qualified as a non-stock, non-profit educational institution under Section 30 (H) of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended.\n\nPlease bear in mind that, \"being a non-stock and/or non-profit corporation does not, by this reason alone, completely exempt an institution from tax.\" [3] Thus, \"statutes granting tax exemptions are construed strictissimi juris against the taxpayer and liberally in favor of the taxing authority. A claim of tax exemption must be clearly shown and based on language in law too plain to be mistaken. Otherwise stated, taxation is the rule, exemption is the exception. The burden of proof rests upon the party claiming the exemption to prove that it is in fact covered by the exemption so claimed.\" [4] (BIR Ruling No. 466-2014 dated November 19, 2014)\n\nIn view of the foregoing, the request of ASSATT CHRISTIAN SCHOOL, INC. to be exempted from income tax on its income as a Section 30 (H) institution is hereby denied as it failed to prove that it is a non-profit corporation. Therefore, ASSATT CHRISTIAN SCHOOL, INC. shall be treated as an ordinary corporation subject to thirty percent (30%) income tax rate pursuant to Section 27 (A) of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended.\n\nPlease be guided accordingly. aScITE\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.)

Quezon Blvd.\nQuiapo, Manila\n\nAttention: AAA\n_______________\n\nGentlemen :\n\nThis refers to your letter dated October 19, 2015, requesting exemption from the payment of withholding tax on the retirement benefits of your retiring employees, namely: HTcADC\n\nName\n\nTIN\n\nDate Hired\n\nDate of Birth\n\nDate of Retirement\n\nAge\n\nYears in Service\n\nBBB\n\n12/05/84\n\n03/19/17\n\n60\n\n32\n\nCCC\n\n02/18/89\n\n05/30/17\n\n60\n\n28\n\nDDD\n\n06/20/83\n\n12/06/17\n\n60\n\n34\n\npursuant to a Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA).\n\nDocuments show that Isetann Department Store, Inc. (TIN: ___________),with principal office address at Isetann Cinerama Complex, C.M. Recto Avenue corner Quezon Boulevard, Quiapo, Manila, is a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the Republic of the Philippines, with Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Company Registration No. 89598.\n\nNagkakaisang Manggagawa ng Isetann, with principal office address at No. 600 Carriedo Street, Sta. Cruz, Manila and Isetann Department Store, Inc. entered into a Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) duly registered with the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) under Certificate of Registration No. NCR-MFO-CBA-02-2013-05 dated February 11, 2013. The aforesaid CBA has an effectivity period from October, 2012 to October, 2017. Section 13 of the CBA provides \u2014\n\n\"Section 13. Retirement Pay. \u2014 The Company agrees to give retirement pay pursuant to existing laws.\"\n\nIn reply, please be informed that pursuant to Section 32 (B) (6) (a) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, retirement benefits received under Section 1 of Republic Act (RA) No. 7641 shall not be included in the gross income and therefore not forming part of the taxable income. Under the said Act, in the absence of a retirement plan or agreement providing for retirement benefits of employees in the establishment, an employee upon reaching the age of sixty (60) years or more, but not beyond sixty-five (65) years which is declared the compulsory retirement age, who has served at least five (5) years in the service of the same employer, may retire and shall be entitled to retirement pay equivalent to at least one-half (1/2) month salary for every year of service, a fraction of at least six (6) months being considered as one whole year.\n\nConsidering that the CBA specifically provided that the provisions of the existing laws shall be applicable as regards the retirement benefits of its employees, RA No. 7641 will apply in this case. Accordingly, BBB, CCC,and DDD may retire upon reaching the retirement age as provided for in RA No. 7641. Moreover, since their years in service are more than the five (5)-year requirement, their retirement benefits are exempt from income tax and consequently, from the withholding tax as prescribed in Section 79, Chapter XIII, Title II of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended.\n\nMoreover, pursuant to Section 2.78.1 of Revenue Regulations No. 2-98, as amended, the terminal pay, i.e., commutation and payment of monetized unused vacation leave credits not exceeding ten (10) days during the year are not subject to income tax and consequently to the withholding tax. Conversely, the cash equivalent of vacation leave exceeding ten (10) days is subject to tax. However, this same principle cannot apply to sick leave credits since an employee must actually go on sick leave to be able to avail of said leave credits. (BIR Ruling No. 199-2011 dated June 29, 2011)\n\nIt is, however, understood that this exemption does not include the payment of the separated employees' salaries and the payment of the 13th month pay and other benefits in excess of the Php90,000.00 [1] threshold under Section 2.78.1 (A) (3) (a) and (A) (7) of Revenue Regulations No. 2-98, as amended. (BIR Ruling No. 199-2011 dated June 29, 2011)\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be ascertained that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void. aScITE\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R.

HTcADC\n\nIt is represented that on September 25, 1998, a merger between Philippine Kho's Association, Inc. and Lunar Civic and Fraternal Association, Inc. took place with the former becoming the surviving entity; that Philippine Kho's Association, Inc. and Lunar Civic and Fraternal Association, Inc. are both non-stock corporations; that pursuant to the merger, no shares or dividends shall be issued to the members or board of trustees of the absorbed entity; that as a consequence of the merger, a certain real property was transferred in favor of Philippine Kho's Association, Inc.;that the property involved is covered by Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. ____________ the \"Property\" with an area of 576 square meters located at 1146 Narra Street, Tondo, Manila and currently registered under the name of Lunar Real Investment Corporation (now: Lunar Civic and Fraternal Association, Inc.);that sometime in 2014, the then Board of Trustees of Philippine Kho's Association, Inc. sought to consolidate the title of the Property in its name; that on November 28, 2014, the necessary taxes (capital gains tax and documentary stamp tax) in relation to the merger were paid in order to effect the transfer of the title from Lunar Civic and Fraternal Association, Inc. to Philippine Kho's Association, Inc.;and that upon presenting the payment and other necessary documents to the Revenue District Office No. 29, Tondo, Manila, you were informed that the merger is tax exempt and was later advised to obtain the necessary opinion from the BIR head office and/or legal department prior to the issuance of Certificate Authorizing Registration (CAR).\n\nIn reply, please be informed that Section 40 (C) (1) & (2) of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997 (Tax Code), as amended, provides, to wit:\n\n\"SEC. 40. Determination of Amount and Recognition of Gain or Loss. \u2014\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(C) Exchange of Property. \u2014\n\n(1) General Rule. \u2014 Except as herein provided, upon the sale or exchange of property, the entire amount of the gain or loss as the case may be, shall be recognized.\n\n(2) Exception. \u2014 No gain or loss shall be recognized if in pursuance of a plan of merger or consolidation \u2014\n\n(a) A corporation, which is a party to a merger or consolidation, exchanges property solely for stock in a corporation,which is a party to the merger or consolidation;\" (Emphasis supplied)\n\nFrom the afore-quoted provision of Section 40 (C) (2) of the Tax Code, as amended, it is clear that in order to qualify as an exception to the recognition of the gain or loss upon the sale or exchange of property, a corporation which is a party to a merger exchanges its property solely for stock in another corporation which is also a party to the merger.\n\nAs defined, merger pertains to the absorption of one or more corporations by another existing corporation, which retains its identity and takes over the rights, privileges, franchises, properties, claims, liabilities and obligations of the absorbed corporation/s. The absorbing corporation continues its existence while the life or lives of the corporation/s is or are terminated. [1]\n\nIn the present case, however, there was no exchange of property solely for stock in another corporation. Pursuant to the merger, Lunar Civic and Fraternal Association, Inc., as the absorbed corporation, transferred its Property to Philippine Kho's Association, Inc., as the surviving corporation, without any issuance of shares of stocks in favor of the members and/or trustees of the absorbed corporation. Although the merger between Lunar Civic and Fraternal Association, Inc. and Philippine Kho's Association, Inc. is a valid reorganization under the Corporation Code, that alone is not sufficient to afford non-recognition of gain or loss obtained in the transaction. Therefore, the provisions of Section 40 (C) (2) of the Tax Code, as amended, is not applicable.\n\nIn view of the foregoing, the merger of Lunar Civic and Fraternal Association, Inc. into Philippine Kho's Association, Inc. does not qualify as a tax-free merger under Section 40 (C) (2) of the Tax Code, as amended, and corresponding taxes should be imposed for dissolution and liquidation. aScITE\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.)

HTcADC\n\nDocuments submitted disclosed that the parties to the joint venture, Valley Construction and Aggregates and DD Likigan Construction are both local contractors. Valley Construction and Aggregates (TIN: ______________) is duly registered with the Philippine Contractors Accreditation Board (PCAB) under Contractor's License No. 2016-2045 valid until June 30, 2019. Likewise, DD Likigan Construction (TIN: ______________) is also registered with PCAB under Contractor's License Form No. 2018-1079, valid until May 04, 2021. The Joint Venture is also registered with PCAB under Special Contractor's License No. SL1-SN-03271 valid until June 30, 2019.\n\nOn January 31, 2018, the Joint Venture entered into a Contract Agreement with the Provincial Government of Mountain Province to undertake the JV Project for a consideration of _________________________________________ (P_______________);and that the parties to the Joint Venture agreed that their respective proportionate share in the profits and losses of the Joint Venture shall be fifty one percent (51%) for Valley Construction and Aggregates and forty nine percent (49%) for DD Likigan Construction.\n\nIn reply, please be informed that pursuant to Section 22 (B) of the National Internal Revenue Code (Tax Code) of 1997, as amended, the term \"corporation\" shall include partnerships, no matter how created or organized, joint stock companies, joint accounts (cuentas en participacion),association or insurance companies, but does not include general professional partnerships and a joint venture or consortium formed for the purpose of undertaking construction projects or engaging in petroleum, coal, geothermal and other energy operations pursuant to an operating or consortium agreement under a service contract with the Government.\n\nLikewise, Section 4 (B) (5) of Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 14-2002 dated September 9, 2002 provides that the withholding of creditable withholding tax (CWT) shall not apply to income payments made to joint ventures or construction formed for the purpose of undertaking construction projects or engaging in petroleum, coal, geothermal & other energy operations pursuant to an operating or consortium agreement under a service contract with the government.\n\nFurthermore, Section 3 of RR No. 10-2012 dated June 1, 2012 provides, to wit:\n\n\"SEC. 3. Joint Ventures Not Taxable as Corporations. \u2014 A joint venture or consortium formed for the purpose of undertaking construction projects which is not considered as corporation under Section 22 of the NIRC of 1997 as amended, should be:\n\n(1) for the undertaking of a construction project; and\n\n(2) should involve joining or pooling of resources by licensed local contractors; that is, licensed as general contractor by the Philippine Contractors Accreditation Board (PCAB) of the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI);\n\n(3) the local contractors are engaged in construction business; and\n\n(4) the Joint Venture itself must likewise be duly licensed as such by the Philippine Contractors Accreditation Board (PCAB) of the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI).\n\nJoint ventures involving foreign contractors may also be treated as a non-taxable corporation only if the member foreign contractor is covered by a special license as contractor by the Philippine Contractors Accreditation Board (PCAB) of the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI); and the construction project is certified by the appropriate Tendering Agency (government office) that the project is a foreign financed/internationally-funded project and that international bidding is allowed under the Bilateral Agreement entered into by and between the Philippine Government and the foreign/international financing institution pursuant to the implementing rules and regulations of Republic Act No. 4566 otherwise known as Contractor's License Law.\n\nAbsent any one of the aforesaid requirements, the joint venture or consortium formed for the purpose of undertaking construction projects shall be considered as taxable corporations. In addition, the tax-exempt joint venture or consortium as herein defined shall not include those who are mere suppliers of goods, services or capital to a construction project.\n\nThe members to a Joint Venture not taxable as corporation shall each be responsible in reporting and paying appropriate income taxes on their respective share to the joint ventures profit.\"\n\nSuch being the case, the Joint Venture formed by Valley Construction and Aggregates and DD Likigan Construction for the purpose of undertaking the project: Improvement of Besao Mountain Province to Tubo-Abra Road Phase II is considered a joint venture not taxable for having complied with the conditions provided under RR No. 10-2012, i.e., (1) the JV is for the undertaking of construction project; (2) the JV involves joining or pooling of resources by licensed local contractors (licensed as general contractor by the PCAB); (3) the local contractors are engaged in construction business; and (4) the JV itself is duly licensed by PCAB; and therefore not subject to the corporate income tax under Section 27 (A) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended (BIR Ruling No. 013-2018 dated January 10, 2018).\n\nFurthermore, the gross corporate payments to the joint venture are, likewise, not subject to the 2% CWT prescribed under Section 57 (B) of the same Code, as implemented by RR No. 2-98, as amended by RR No. 14-2002. (Section 4 (B) (5) of RR No. 14-2002 dated September 9, 2002) as amended.\n\nThe Provincial Government of Mountain Province being a government entity shall, before making payment on account of each purchase of goods and services which shall be subject to the value-added tax imposed in Sections 106 and 108 of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, deduct and withhold a final value-added tax at the rate of five percent (5%) of the gross payment thereof pursuant to Section 114 (C) of the same Code (BIR Ruling No. 013-2018 dated January 10, 2018).\n\nThe herein Joint Venture being exempt from corporate income tax is not required to file quarterly and final adjustment returns but Valley Construction and Aggregates and DD Likigan Construction as parties to the Joint Venture, are separately subject to the regular corporate income tax imposed under Section 27 (A) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, on their taxable income during each taxable year respectively derived by them from the aforesaid construction project (BIR Ruling No. 1243-2018 dated October 12, 2018).\n\nIt should be emphasized that the respective net income of the co-venturers derived from the JV Project is subject to the creditable withholding tax imposed under Section 57 of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, and implemented by RR No. 2-98, as amended. Thus, before the Joint Venture distributes the net income to Valley Construction and Aggregates and DD Likigan Construction pursuant to their agreed profits/income sharing, it shall withhold the tax based on the net income of its co-venturers. (BIR Ruling Nos. 176-14 dated November 26, 2014 and 0503-2019 dated September 6, 2019)\n\nFinally, Valley Construction and Aggregates and DD Likigan Construction are required to enroll themselves to the Bureau of Internal Revenue's Electronic Filing and Payment System (EFPS).The enrollment should be done at the Revenue District Office (RDO) where they are registered as taxpayers. (Section 4 of RR No. 10-2012)\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be ascertained that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered as null and void. DETACa\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R.

No. 9904 otherwise known as the \"Magna Carta for Homeowners and Homeowners' Associations,\" as enunciated in Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 9-2013 which clarifies the taxability of association dues, membership fees, and other assessments/charges collected by Homeowners' Associations. HTcADC\n\nDocuments submitted disclosed that DASMARI\u00d1AS VILLAGE ASSOCIATION, INC.,is a non-stock and non-profit residential homeowners' association, with Taxpayers Identification No. ___________ and duly registered with the Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board under Certificate of Registration No. 01525; that it is situated and within the jurisdiction of the City of Makati; and that among the purposes for which the Association was incorporated is \"to promote and advance the best interest, general welfare, prosperity and safeguard the well-being of the owners, lessees and occupants of the property in the Dasmari\u00f1as Village\";and that the Officer-in-Charge of Makati City, Aileen M. Soriano, on December 21, 2017, issued a Certification stating that:\n\n\"The Dasmari\u00f1as Village Association, Inc. (DVAI) is a legitimate Homeowners Association that provides funds and basic services to its members, such as but not limited to the following:\n\n1. Security and safety (2 fire trucks with Emergency Response Team, CCTVs, ambulance services)\n\n2. Garbage collection and free trash bags\n\n3. Repair, maintenance and cleaning of streets, sidewalks, parks, building & facilities and other common areas\n\n4. Streetlights\n\n5. Lighted street name signs\n\n6. Provision of space for water and sewer facilities\n\n7. Other similar services and facilities\n\nThe City Government of Makati (CGM) did not appropriate fund and resources intended for the above basic services to the members of DVAI since it involves private properties. Hence, the aforesaid basic services to the members of DVAI is not included among the programs and projects of the City. Furthermore, as a private organization, the delivery of basic services is with their exclusive control and supervision in accordance with Section 3(d) of the Republic Act No. 9904, otherwise known as the Magna Carta of Homeowners Association.\n\nConsidering that the CGM lacks resources due to the reason stated above, we would like to recommend the approval of their application for tax exemption.\"\n\nDASMARI\u00d1AS VILLAGE ASSOCIATION, INC. bases its claim for tax exemption on Section 18 of R.A. No. 9904, which provides:\n\n\"SECTION 18. Relationship with LGUs. \u2014 Homeowners' associations shall complement, support and strengthen LGUs in providing vital services to their members and help implement local government policies, programs, ordinances, and rules.\n\nAssociations are encouraged to actively cooperate with LGUs in furtherance of their common goals and activities for the benefit of the residents of the subdivisions/villages and their environments.\n\nWhere the LGUs lack resources to provide for basic services, the associations shall endeavor to tap the means to provide for the same. In recognition of the associations' efforts to assist the LGUs in providing such basic services, association dues and income derived from rentals of their facilities shall be tax-exempt: Provided, That such income and dues shall be used for the cleanliness, safety, security and other basic services needed by the members, including the maintenance of the facilities of their respective subdivisions or villages. x x x\"\n\nA careful review of the Certification issued by Officer-in-Charge of Makati City, dated December 21, 2017, shows that the City Government of Makati does not support the homeowners association not because it lacks resources but because it does not want to provide financial support to programs involving private properties, and as a private organization, the delivery of basic services is with DASMARI\u00d1AS VILLAGE ASSOCIATION, INC.'s exclusive control and supervision in accordance with Section 3 (d) of R.A. No. 9904, otherwise known as the Magna Carta of Homeowners Association. Thus, we regret to inform you that DASMARI\u00d1AS VILLAGE ASSOCIATION, INC. does not fall within the purview of those homeowners' associations which may be exempted for income tax under Section 18 of R.A. No. 9904 considering that the requisite qualification that the city or municipality concerned must be lacking in resources to provide for basic services is absent.\n\nConsequently, DASMARI\u00d1AS VILLAGE ASSOCIATION, INC.,shall be subject to the applicable internal revenue taxes on its income from association dues, rentals of their facilities, trade business and other activities. Specifically:\n\nIncome Tax\n\nIt shall be subject to the corresponding internal revenue taxes imposed under the National Internal Revenue Code (Tax Code) of 1997, as amended, on its income derived from association dues and rentals of its facilities, which income should be returned for taxation. Likewise, interest income from currency bank deposits and yield or any other monetary benefit from deposit substitute instruments and from trust funds and similar arrangements, and royalties derived from sources within the Philippines are subject to the 20% final withholding tax; provided, however, that interest income derived by it from a depository bank under the expanded foreign currency deposit system shall be subject to 15% [1] final withholding tax pursuant to Section 27 (D) (1) in relation to Section 57 (A), both of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended. Moreover, it is required to file on or before April 15 of each year a profit and loss statement and balance sheet with the annual information return under oath, stating its gross income and expenses incurred during the year and a certificate showing that there has not been any change in its By-Laws, Articles of Incorporation, manner of operation and activities as well as resources and disposition of income. aScITE\n\nValue-Added Tax (VAT) or Percentage Tax\n\nDASMARI\u00d1AS VILLAGE ASSOCIATION, INC.'s gross receipts from association dues, membership fees, and other assessment/charges collected in purely reimbursement basis by a homeowners' association are not subject to VAT. [2] However, gross receipts from the operation not derived from rental of its facilities, association dues, membership fees, other assessment and charges collected in purely reimbursement basis shall be subject to the 12% VAT imposed under Section 108 of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, or to the three percent (3%) tax imposed under Section 116 in relation to Section 109 (BB) of the same Code if the gross sales or receipts from such sale of goods and services do not exceed Three Million Pesos (P3,000,000.00). [3]\n\nIt should be understood that DASMARI\u00d1AS VILLAGE ASSOCIATION, INC. shall be constituted as withholding agent of the government if it acts as an employer and its employees receive compensation income subject to the withholding tax under Section 57 of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended.\n\nFinally, DASMARI\u00d1AS VILLAGE ASSOCIATION, INC. is also subject to the payment of the annual registration fee of PhP500.00 as prescribed in Section 236 (B) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended. It is also required under Section 6 (C) in relation to Section 237 of the same Code to issue duly registered receipts for services rendered which do not comprise income from association dues and rentals of their facilities.\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be disclosed that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R.

In view thereof, DBM-PS withholds 5% on the payments made to Studio Graphics Corp. Hence, this request.\n\nIn reply, please be informed that Section 12 of RA No. 8047 provides tax incentives to persons or entities engaged in the book industry, viz.:\n\n\"Section 12. Incentives for Book Development . . .\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\nBooks, magazines, periodicals, newspapers, including book publishing and printing, as well as its distribution and circulation, shall be exempt from the coverage of the expanded value added tax law.\" (Underscoring supplied)\n\nMoreover, Section 109 (1) (R) of the National Internal Revenue Code (Tax Code) of 1997, as amended, states that:\n\n\"Sec. 109. Exempt Transactions. \u2014\n\n(1) Subject to the provisions of Subsection (2) hereof, the following transactions shall be exempt from the value-added tax:\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(R) Sale, importation, printing or publication of books and any newspaper, magazine, review or bulletin, which appears at regular intervals with fixed prices for subscription and sale and which is not devoted principally to the publication of paid advertisements;\"\n\nIn relation thereto, Section 4.109-1 (B) (r) of Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 16-2005, as amended, states that:\n\n\"Section 4.109-1. VAT Exempt Transactions. \u2014\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(B) Subject to the provisions of Section 4.109.2 hereof, the following transactions shall be exempt from VAT:\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(r) Sale, importation, printing or publication of books and any newspaper, magazine, review, or bulletin which appears at regular intervals with fixed prices for subscription and sale and which is not devoted principally to the publication of paid advertisements;\"\n\nIn Revenue Memorandum Circular (RMC) No. 75-2012 dated November 22, 2012, this Office made a clarification on the VAT exemption granted under Section 109 (1) (R) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, to wit:\n\n1. A newspaper, magazine, review or bulletin must be: (1) printed or published at regular intervals; (2) available for subscription and sale at fixed prices; and (3) are not principally devoted to the publication of paid advertisements.\n\n2. The terms \"book,\" \"newspaper,\" \"magazine,\" \"review\" and \"bulletin\" as used in the provision refer to printed materials in hard copies. They do not include those in digital or electronic format or computerized versions, including but not limited to: e-books, e-journals, electronic copies, online library sources, CDs and software.\n\nIn view of the foregoing, this Office confirms that the Studio Graphics Corp. is exempt from the twelve percent (12%) VAT on its book printing, as well as its distribution of Grade 3 Araling Panlipunan for the DepEd pursuant to Public Bidding No. 19-037-9. Accordingly, the DBM-PS shall no longer withhold and remit to the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) the five percent (5%) final withholding VAT mandated under Revenue Memorandum Order (RMO) No. 23-2014, by reason of Section 109 (1) (R) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended. Apropos, the operation of Section 4.114 (2) (a) of Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 16-2005, as amended, viz.:\n\n\"Sec. 4.114-2. Withholding of VAT on Government Money Payments. \u2014 (a) The government or any of its political subdivisions, instrumentalities or agencies, including government-owned or controlled corporations (GOCCs) shall, before making payment on account of each purchase of goods and/or of services which are subject to the value-added tax imposed in Secs. 106 and 108 of this Code, deduct and withhold a final value-added tax at the rate of five percent (5%) of the gross payment thereof.\"\n\nfinds no application to the transaction between Studio Graphics Corp. and DBM-PS due to the exemption granted to the former predicated under the Section 109 (1) (R) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended.\n\nIt is worth noting that if Studio Graphics Corp. is engaged in other non-exempt activities such as the printing of brochures, bookbinding, engraving, stereotyping, electrotyping, lithographing of various reference books, trade books, journals and other literary works, said transactions are subject to VAT, and the taxpayer shall be required to register its business as VAT business entity and must issue a separate VAT invoice/receipt therefor to record the same. Also, sale of books, newspapers, magazines, reviews and bulletins in digital or electronic format or computerized versions, including but not limited to e-books, e-journals, electronic copies, online library services, CDs and software shall be subject to VAT. [2]\n\nLikewise, VAT is an indirect tax payable by the seller and not the purchaser of goods. Being an indirect tax, it can be shifted or passed on to the buyer/purchaser, transferee or lessee of the goods, properties or services. Once shifted to the buyer/customer as an addition to the cost of goods or services sold, it is no longer a tax but an additional cost which the buyer/customer has to pay in order to obtain the goods or services. Thus, the shifting of the VAT to Studio Graphics Corp. does not make it the person directly liable and therefore, it cannot invoke its tax exemption privilege under Section 109 (1) (R) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, to avoid the passing on or shifting of the VAT. Hence, its purchase of goods, properties, or services from its suppliers shall nevertheless be subject to the 12% VAT pursuant to Section 107 of the same Code. [3]\n\nInsofar as the amounts withheld by the DBM-PS and already remitted to the BIR, Studio Graphics Corp. should file a claim for VAT refund pursuant to Revenue Memorandum Circular (RMC) No. 47-2019 which provides for the uniform guidelines and revised mandatory requirements for the processing and grant of VAT refund application. However, amounts withheld by the DBM-PS but not yet remitted to the BIR, Studio Graphics Corp. should file its claim for VAT refund to the DBM-PS.\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be ascertained that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R.

MARY MAGDALENE SCHOOL (PAROCHIAL),INC. for tax exemption certificate being enjoyed by non-stock, non-profit corporation or association under Section 30 (H) of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) of 1997, as amended, which was forwarded to this Office by Revenue Region No. 9A, CaBaMiRo, Sto. Tomas, Batangas, dated February 19, 2018.\n\nIt is represented that ST. MARY MAGDALENE SCHOOL (PAROCHIAL),INC. with BIR Taxpayer's Identification No. (TIN) ____________ and Certificate of Registration No. 1RC0001315807 dated January 01, 1996 is a non-stock, non-profit corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the Republic of the Philippines; that it is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under Company Registration No. 0103704; and that the purposes [1] for which the association was incorporated are:\n\n1. To give a sound, complete and Catholic education to children and youth in the Philippines and to promote their intellectual and moral development.\n\n2. To promote and facilitate social and professional relations, goodwill and cooperation, among persons involved in the economic, educational and cultural activities.\n\n3. To conduct or participate in seminars, symposiums, group discussions, radio programs, television programs, or film presentations related to the economic, educational and cultural aspects.\n\n4. To prepare, negotiate, sign and implement agreements or contracts with any agency, enterprise or instrumentally, whether public or private, in the Philippines in relation to economic, educational and cultural matters.\n\n5. To advance the mutual interests of members of this corporation in relation, educational and cultural aspects.\n\n6. To raise funds by membership contribution and/or solicit contributions and donations from all sources to pay for the expenses of this corporation.\n\n7. To do any and all proper things for the advancement of the legitimate interests of the members of this Corporation, including mutual assistance in whatever form agreed upon among themselves in case of need; and\n\n8. To do all things necessary, suitable, and/or proper for the accomplishment of the above purposes, and any one or more of them.\n\nIn reply, please be informed that paragraph 3, Section 4, Article XIV of the 1987 Constitution states that: CAIHTE\n\n\"All revenues and assets of non-stock, non-profit educational institutions used actually, directly, and exclusively for educational purposes shall be exempt from taxes and duties.\" (Emphasis supplied)\n\nLikewise, Section 30 (H) of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended, provides, viz.:\n\n\"Sec. 30. Exemptions from Tax on Corporations. \u2014 The following organizations shall not be taxed under this Title in respect to income received by them as such:\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(H) A non-stock and non-profit educational institution; x x x\" (Emphasis supplied)\n\n\"Non-stock\" means \"no part of its income is distributable as dividends to its members, trustees, or officers\" and that any profit \"obtained as an incident to its operations shall, whenever necessary or proper, be used for the furtherance of the purpose or purposes for which the corporation was organized.\" [2] \"Non-profit\" means that \"no net income or asset accrues to or benefits any member or specific person, with all the net income or assets devoted to the institution's purposes and all its activities conducted not for profit.\" [3]\n\nThere are two requisites in order for an educational institution to be exempt from tax as provided under Revenue Memorandum Order (RMO) No. 44-2016 dated July 25, 2016, to wit:\n\na) It is a non-stock, non-profit educational institution; and\n\nb) Its revenues are actually, directly and exclusively used for educational purposes. (Emphasis supplied)\n\nUnder the above quoted provisions, one of the requirements for an educational institution to be exempt from income tax pursuant to the provisions of paragraph 3, Section 4, Article XIV of the 1987 Constitution, in relation to Section 30 (H) of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended, and RMO No. 44-2016, is to be organized as a non-stock, non-profit educational institution. However, in the instant case, the submitted Articles of Incorporation of ST. MARY MAGDALENE SCHOOL (PAROCHIAL),INC. disclosed that its registration with the SEC is only as a non-stock corporation.\n\nMoreover, Revenue Memorandum Circular (RMC) No. 51-2014 had clarified that in order for an entity to qualify as a non-stock and/or non-profit corporation/association/organization exempt from income tax under Section 30 of the NIRC of 1997, as amended, its earnings or assets shall not inure to the benefit of any of its trustees, organizers, officers, members or any specific person. The following are considered \"inurements\" of such nature:\n\n1. The payment of compensation, salaries, or honorarium to its trustees or organizers; x x x.\n\nIn the submitted documents of ST. MARY MAGDALENE SCHOOL (PAROCHIAL),INC.,it was disclosed that Directors are entitled to compensation. Article II, Section 4 of the By-Laws of ST. MARY MAGDALENE SCHOOL (PAROCHIAL),INC. adopted on March 20, 1982, states that:\n\n\"ARTICLE II. \u2014 x x x. 4. Directors, as such, shall receive such compensation for their services as may be from time to time fixed by the board of directors subject to the approval of the members.\"\n\nThe giving of per diem/honorarium and endowment to the members of the Board of Directors is considered a distribution of the equity (including the net income) ST. MARY MAGDALENE SCHOOL (PAROCHIAL),INC. This is a form of private inurement which the law prohibits in the organization and operation of a non-stock, non-profit corporation. This act violates the requirement that no part of the net income or assets of the corporation shall inure to the benefit of any individual or specific person. Thus, ST. MARY MAGDALENE SCHOOL (PAROCHIAL),INC. cannot be qualified as a non-stock, non-profit corporation under Section 30 (H) of the NIRC of 1997, as amended\n\nIn view of the foregoing, the request of ST. MARY MAGDALENE SCHOOL (PAROCHIAL),INC. to be exempted from income tax on its income as a Section 30 (H) corporation is hereby denied as it failed to prove that it is a non-profit corporation. Therefore, ST. MARY MAGDALENE SCHOOL (PAROCHIAL),INC. shall be treated as an ordinary corporation subject to thirty percent (30%) income tax rate pursuant to Section 27 (A) and other internal revenue taxes imposed by the NIRC of 1997, as amended.

To construct, manage, maintain and operate adequate facilities and services for its members;\n\n2. To initiate and organize socio-cultural projects and activities to awaken community consciousness and belonging;\n\n3. To promote, enhance and foster the development and improvement of the quality of life of the members through livelihood projects and other economic activities;\n\n4. To acquire, accept donations, purchase, own, hold, develop, lease, mortgage, pledge, exchange, sell, transfer or otherwise invest, deal in or trade, in any manner permitted by the law and the rules and regulations of government regulatory or licensing agencies, real and personal property of every kind and description, or any interest therein, as may be necessary for the accomplishment of the purposes of the Association;\n\n5. To borrow and otherwise contract indebtedness and issue notes, bonds and other evidence of indebtedness and to secure payment therefor by mortgage, pledge, or deed of trust of, or through encumbrances or any and all of its then-owned or after-acquired real or personal properties and assets, as may be permitted by law;\n\n6. To enter into, make, perform and carry out, or cancel and rescind contracts of every kind and for any lawful purpose with any person, firm, association, corporation, syndicate, domestic or foreign, or others;\n\n7. To do or perform any other acts and things, and to have and exercise any other power which may be necessary, convenient and appropriate to accomplish the purpose to which the Association is organized.\n\nIn reply thereto, please be informed that UNITED POOR HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION, INC., a residential homeowners association, is not among those non-stock, non-profit corporations contemplated under Section 30 of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended. Hence, UNITED POOR HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION, INC. may not avail of the income tax exemption under the aforesaid provision. However, Revenue Memorandum Circular (RMC) No. 9-2013 discussed the income taxability of association dues, membership fees, and other assessments/charges collected by a homeowners' association from its homeowner-members and other entities, to wit:\n\n\"I. Income Tax \u2014 Section 18 of R.A. No. 9904 which exempts from taxation the association dues and income derived from rental subject to certain conditions is an implied recognition by Congress that such receipts are subject to tax under existing laws. Thus, the amounts paid in as dues or fees by homeowner-members of a homeowners' association form part of the gross income of the latter subject to income tax. This is because a homeowners' association furnishes its members with benefits, advantages and privileges in return to such payments. For tax purposes, the association dues, membership fees, and other assessment/charges collected by a homeowners' association constitute income payments or compensation for beneficial services it provides to its member and tenants. The previous interpretation that the assessment dues are funds which are merely held in trust by a homeowners' association lacks legal basis and is hereby abandoned.\n\nMoreover, since a homeowner's association is subject to income tax, income payment made to it are subject to applicable withholding taxes under existing regulations.\"\n\nNotwithstanding the above, RMC No. 9-2013 likewise provides that the association dues and income derived from rentals of UNITED POOR HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION, INC. properties may be exempted from income tax provided that the following conditions are complied with pursuant to Section 18 of RA No. 9904:\n\na. The homeowners' association must be a duly constituted \"Association\" as defined under Section 3 (b) of RA No. 9904;\n\nb. The local government unit having jurisdiction over the homeowners' association must issue certification identifying the basic services being rendered by the homeowners' association and therein stating its lack of resources to render such services notwithstanding its clear mandate under applicable laws, rules and regulations. Provided further, that such services must fall within the purview of the \"basic community services and facilities\" which is defined under Section 3 (d) of RA No. 9904 as those referring to service and facilities that rebound to the benefit of all homeowners' and from which, by reason of practicality, no homeowner may be excluded such as, but not limited to: security; street and vicinity lights' maintenance, repairs and cleaning of streets; garbage collection and disposal; and other similar services and facilities; and\n\nc. The homeowners' association must present proof (i.e., financial statements) that the income and dues are used for the cleanliness, safety, security, and other basic services needed by the members, including the maintenance of the facilities of their respective subdivisions or villages.\n\nWith respect to value-added tax, Section 4.109-1 (B) (1) (y) of Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 13-2018 provides that:\n\n\"SEC. 4.109-1. VAT-Exempt Transactions. \u2014\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(B) Exempt transactions. \u2014\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(1) Subject to the provisions of Section 4.109-2 hereof, the following transactions shall be exempt from VAT:\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(y) Association dues, membership fees, and other assessments and charges collected on a purely reimbursement basis by homeowners' associations and condominium corporations established under Republic Act No. 9904 (Magna Carta for Homeowners and Homeowners' Associations) and Republic Act No. 4726 (The Condominium Act), respectively;\"\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\nHowever, gross receipts from the operation not derived from rental of its facilities, association dues, membership fees, other assessment and charges collected in purely reimbursement basis shall be subject to the 12% VAT imposed under Section 108 of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, or three percent (3%) tax imposed under Section 116 in relation to Section 109 (BB) of the same Code if the gross sales or receipts from such sale of goods and services do not exceed Three Million Pesos (P3,000,000.00). [1]\n\nIn this case, there was no showing that the UNITED POOR HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION, INC. met the above conditions for the entitlement of tax exemption under RA No. 9904.

On September 15, 1999, spouses AABB established a trust account with the Trust Department of PentaCapital Investment Corporation through the execution of a Trust Agreement subjecting the aforementioned condominium unit in trust with the latter as Trustee. Condominium Certificate of Title No. 71165 was then issued in favor of PentaCapital Investment Corporation. On July 17, 2014, PentaCapital Investment Corporation surrendered its trust license to the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas. In the meantime, spouses AABB decided to start transferring their properties in the name of their children which initially requires them to transfer the properties, among others, the subject condominium unit in Makati, under trust in their own name. Thus, a Termination of Trust and Transfer to Beneficiary was executed on March 27, 2018.\n\nIn reply, please be informed that Section 24 (D) (1) of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) of 1997, as amended, provides, viz.:\n\n\"Section 24. Income Tax Rates. \u2014\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(D) Capital Gains from Sale of Real Property. \u2014\n\n(1) In General. \u2014 The provisions of Section 39(B) notwithstanding, a final tax of six percent (6%) based on the gross selling price or current fair market value as determined in accordance with Section 6(E) of this Code, whichever is higher, is hereby imposed upon capital gains presumed to have been realized from the sale, exchange, or other disposition of real property located in the Philippines, classified as capital assets, including pacto de retro sales and other forms of conditional sales, by individuals, including estates and trusts: Provided, That the tax liability, if any, on gains from sales or other dispositions of real property to the government or any of its political subdivisions or agencies or to government-owned or controlled corporations shall be determined either under Section 24(A) or under this Subsection, at the option of the Taxpayer.\"\n\nRecords disclosed, however, that there is no sale, exchange or disposition of real property involved, since spouses AABB are the real owners of the subject realty, while PentaCapital Investment Corporation merely acted as Trustee. cSEDTC\n\nMoreover, the transaction is not predicated by a valuable consideration considering that the reconveyance is ostensibly just for return of the property to the legal owner and merely acknowledges, confirms and consolidates the legal title and beneficial ownership over the property in the name of spouses AABB, the Trustors.\n\nIn BIR Ruling No. 031-99 dated March 19, 1999, this Office had occasion to rule that:\n\n\"...the conveyance by the Trustee in favor of the Trustor of the subject properties which the former acquired by virtue of the Trust Agreement is not to be treated as another transfer separate and distinct from the sale between the original owner and the Trustee. The conveyance is merely to be treated as a continuation and confirmation of title in favor of the ultimate and real beneficiary of the subject properties.\"\n\nAccordingly, the transfer of title of the afore-stated property by the Trustee in favor of the beneficiaries, who are the beneficial owners thereof is not subject to capital gains tax imposed under Sec. 24 (D) (1) of the NIRC of 1997, as amended, or to the creditable withholding tax prescribed in Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 2-98, as amended, implementing Section 57 (B) of the NIRC of 1997, as amended. [1]\n\nUnder Section 196 of the NIRC of 1997, as amended, the deeds or documents subject to the documentary stamp tax (DST) imposed therein are those where the realty sold shall be granted, assigned, transferred, or otherwise conveyed to a purchaser or purchasers or to any other person or persons designated by such purchaser or purchasers, thereby excluding from its purview the instant case considering that the supposed purchasers are actually the owners thereof. Furthermore, under Section 191 of Revenue Regulations No. 26, otherwise known as the \"Documentary Stamp Tax Regulations,\" conveyances to a trust without valuable consideration, or from a trustee to a cestui que trust without valuable consideration are not subject to tax. [2]\n\nSince the reconveyance of the afore-stated property by the Trustee in favor of spouses AABBB, the real owners thereof, is in connection and in recognition of a trust, the said transfer is not subject to the DST imposed under Section 196 of the NIRC of 1997, as amended. However, the notarial acknowledgment to said deed of reconveyance is subject to the P30.00 DST as imposed under Section 188 of the NIRC of 1997, as amended.\n\nSection 98 of the NIRC of 1997, as amended, provides that a donor's tax is generally imposed on the transfer by any person, resident or non-resident, of property by gift. The donor's tax applies, whether such transfer is in trust or otherwise, whether the gift is direct or indirect, and whether the property is real or personal, tangible or intangible. The essential elements of a valid donation are: (1) the reduction of the patrimony of the donor, (2) the increase in the patrimony of the donee, and (3) the intent to do an act of liberality (animus donandi). In this case, there is no intention to donate on the part of the Trustee since the reconveyance merely transfers the ownership of the subject realty to the true buyers/owners. Hence, the transfer of the property to spouses AABB by the Trustee is exempt from the donor's tax imposed under Section 98 of the same Tax Code.\n\nFinally, the reconveyance is not subject to value-added tax (VAT) because the said realty is not held primarily for sale to customers or for lease in the ordinary course of business. [3]\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be ascertained that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R.

CAIHTE\n\nIn reply, please be informed that Section 29 (A) and (B) of the 1997 Tax Code, as amended, and as implemented by RR No. 2-2001, provides that in addition to other taxes imposed by Title II of the same Code, there shall be imposed for each taxable year a tax equal to 10% of the improperly accumulated taxable income of corporations formed or availed of for the purpose of avoiding the income tax with respect to its shareholders or the shareholders of any other corporation, by permitting the earnings and profits of the corporation to accumulate instead of dividing them among or distributing them to the shareholders.\n\nThus, IAET is being imposed in the nature of a penalty to the corporation for the improper accumulation of its earnings, and as a form of deterrent to the avoidance of tax upon shareholders who are supposed to pay dividends tax on the earnings distributed to them by the corporation. However, the IAET shall not apply to, among others, publicly-held corporations.\n\nSection 29 of the 1997 Tax Code, as amended, provides, viz.:\n\n\"SEC. 29. Imposition of Improperly Accumulated Earnings Tax. \u2014\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(B) Tax on Corporations Subject to Improperly Accumulated Earnings Tax.\n\n(1) In General. \u2014 The improperly accumulated earnings tax imposed in the preceding section shall apply to every corporation formed or availed for the purpose of avoiding the income tax with respect to its shareholders or the shareholders of any other corporation, by permitting earnings and profits to accumulate instead of being divided or distributed.\n\n(2) Exceptions. \u2014 The improperly accumulated earnings tax as provided for under this Section shall not apply to:\n\n(a) Publicly-held corporations;\n\n(b) Banks and other non-bank financial intermediaries; and\n\n(c) Insurance companies.\n\nxxx xxx xxx\" (Emphasis supplied)\n\nFurthermore, second paragraph of Section 4 of RR No. 2-2001 provides that:\n\n\"For purposes of these Regulations, closely-held corporations are those corporations at least fifty percent (50%) in value of the outstanding capital stock or at least fifty percent (50%) of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote is owned directly or indirectly by or for not more than twenty (20) individuals. Domestic corporations not falling under the aforesaid definition are, therefore, publicly-held corporations.\"\n\nThe same Section further provides that \"for purposes of determining whether the corporation is closely held corporation, insofar as such determination is based on stock ownership, stock owned directly or indirectly by or for a corporation, partnership, estate or trust shall be considered as being owned proportionately by its shareholders, partners or beneficiaries.\"\n\nBased on the foregoing provisions, there is a need to determine the identities of the ultimate (individual) owners and their extent of stock ownership for the purpose of ascertaining the ownership of a corporation. In the instant case, considering that MTI is a wholly owned subsidiary of MTI-US and at least 50% of the outstanding capital of MTI-US is owned, directly or indirectly, by more than 20 individuals, MTI is not considered a closely-held corporation for IAET purposes.

However, if upon investigation, it will be disclosed that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R.

(\"Sinclair\"), a corporation duly registered under the laws of the Republic of the Philippines with address at No. 7433 Yakal St., Makati City, Metro Manila; that on June 30, 2016, Sinclair declared a voluntary dissolution of its company, resulting to the issuance of liquidating dividends in favor of GDSK, which comprise of 6,278 shares in Medical Doctors, Inc., valued at ____________________ Pesos (Php_______________); that in order to distribute the said shares to GDSK, Sinclair executed a Deed of Assignment in favor of GDSK resulting in the imposition of 30% income tax rate; and that on April 05, 2019, GDSK sold one-half of the 6,278 share in Medical Doctors, Inc., or 3,139 shares to BBB, for the amount of ____________________ Pesos (Php_______________). Based on the foregoing representation, GDSK and BBB are of the position that the basis in computing capital gains tax in the subsequent sale of 3,139 shares in Medical Doctors, Inc. is the value used when the liquidating dividend was received, or ____________________ Pesos (Php_______________).\n\nPlease be informed that Section 7 of Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 06-2008 provides the rules on the taxability on the sale, barter or exchange of shares of stock not traded through the local stock exchange, to wit: aDSIHc\n\n\"SECTION 7. Sale, Barter or Exchange of Shares of Stock Not Traded Through a Local Stock Exchange Pursuant to Secs. 24 (C), 25 (A)(3), 25 (B), 27 (D) (2), 28 (A) (7) (C), 28 (B) (5) (C) of The Tax Code, as amended. \u2014\n\n(a) Tax Rate. \u2014 x x x.\n\n(b) Tax Base. \u2014 The tax imposed in Subsection (a) above shall be upon the net capital gains realized during the taxable year from the sale, barter, exchange or disposition of shares of stock, except shares sold or disposed of through the Local Stock Exchange which is covered by the provisions of Secs. 5 and 6 above.\n\n(c) Determination of Amount and Recognition of Gain or Loss. \u2014\n\n(c.1) Determination of Selling Price. \u2014 In determining the selling price, the following rules shall apply:\n\n(c.1.1) In the case of cash sale, the selling price shall be the total consideration per deed of sale.\n\n(c.1.2) If the total consideration of the sale or disposition consists partly in money and partly in kind, the selling price shall be sum of money and the fair market value of the property received.\n\n(c.1.3) In the case of exchange, the selling price shall be the fair market value of the property received.\n\n(c.1.4) In case the fair market value of the shares of stock sold, bartered, or exchanged is greater than the amount of money and/or fair market value of the property received, the excess of the fair market value of the shares of stock sold, bartered or exchanged over the amount of money and the fair market value of the property, if any, received as consideration shall be deemed a gift subject to the donor's tax under Sec. 100 of the Tax Code, as amended.\n\n(c.2) Definition of \"fair market value\" of the Shares of Stock.\n\n(c.2.1) x x x\n\n(c.2.2) x x x\n\n(c.2.3) x x x\n\n(c.3) Determination of Gain or Loss from Sale or Disposition of Shares of Stock. \u2014 The gain from the sale or other disposition of shares of stock shall be the excess of the amount realized therefrom over the basis or adjusted basis for determining gain, and the loss shall be the excess of the basis or adjusted basis for determining loss over the amount realized. The amount realized from the sale or other disposition of property shall be the sum of money received plus the fair market value of the property (other than money) received, if any.\n\n(c.3.1) Basis for Determining Gain or Loss from Sale or Disposition of Shares of Stock. \u2014 Gain or loss from the sale, barter or exchange of property, for a valuable consideration, shall be determined by deducting from the amount of consideration contracted to be paid, the vendor/transferor's basis for the property sold or disposed plus expenses of sale/disposition, if any.\n\n(c.3.1.1) Acquired by Purchase. \u2014 If the property is acquired by purchase, the basis is the cost of such property.\n\nDetermination of the Cost. \u2014 The cost basis for determining the capital gains or losses for shares of stock acquired through purchase shall be governed by the following rules:\n\n(i) If the shares of stock can be identified, then the cost shall be the actual purchase price plus all costs of acquisition, such as commissions, documentary stamp taxes, transfer fees, etc.\n\n(ii) If the shares of stock cannot be properly identified, then the cost to be assigned shall be computed on the basis of the first-in first-out (FIFO) method.\n\n(iii) x x x\n\n(iv) x x x\" (Emphasis Ours)\n\nIn relation thereto, in the event that the stocks were given as a liquidating dividend and the corresponding taxes were duly settled as in the case at bar, it is tantamount to a sale or purchase in favor of the stockholder. As discussed in the case of Commissioner of Internal Revenue vs. Goodyear Philippines, G.R. No. 216130 dated August 03, 2016, the Supreme Court held that:\n\n\"It is also worth mentioning that one of the primary features of an ordinary dividend is that the distribution should be in the nature of a recurring return on stock which, however, does not obtain in this case. x x x\n\nIn Wise & Co., Inc. v. Meer: The amounts thus distributed among the plaintiffs were not in the nature of a recurring return on stock \u2014 in fact, they surrendered and relinquished their stock in return for said distributions, thus ceasing to be stockholders of the Hongkong Company, which in turn ceased to exist in its own right as a going concern during its more or less brief administration of the business as trustee for the Manila Company, and finally disappeared even as such trustee.\n\n\"The distinction between a distribution in liquidation and an ordinary dividend is factual; the result in each case depending on the particular circumstances of the case and the intent of the parties. If the distribution is in the nature of a recurring return on stock it is an ordinary dividend. However, if the corporation is really winding up its business or recapitalizing and narrowing its activities, the distribution may properly be treated as in complete or partial liquidation and as payment by the corporation to the stockholder for his stock. x x x (Montgomery, Federal Income Tax Handbook [1938-1939], 258 x x x) (Emphases and underscoring supplied)\"\n\nPerforce, if the shares of stock in Medical Doctors, Inc. were acquired at a total cost of Php_____________ or at ____________________ Pesos per share (Php________/share), the cost basis for 3,139 shares sold to BBB is Php______________, as identified when the stocks were acquired.\n\nIn computing the net capital gains or loss realized on the sale, barter, exchange or disposition of shares of stock, the identifiable amount of the vendor/transferor's basis for the property sold or disposed plus expenses of sale/disposition, if any, shall be deducted from the consideration contracted to be paid. In case, however, that the fair market value of the shares of stock sold is greater than the amount of money received, the excess of the fair market value of the shares of stock sold over the amount of money received as consideration shall be deemed as gift subject to the donor's tax under Section 100 of the Tax Code, as amended, unless shown to have been made at arm's length and free from donative intent.\n\nIn view of the foregoing, this office confirms the position of GDSK and BBB that the basis in computing capital gains tax in the subsequent sale of 3,139 shares in Medical Doctors, Inc. is the value used when the liquidating dividend was received, or Php________.

(DMC-UPDI) is not subject to Capital Gains Tax (CGT) imposed under Section 24 (D) (1) of the National Internal Revenue Code (\"Tax Code\") of 1997, as amended.\n\nIt is represented that you acquired the aforesaid condominium unit sometime in October 2013 through the in-house financing of DMC-UPDI. Eventually, you procured a loan from Philippine Savings Bank (PS Bank) in order to pay the outstanding balance of the aforesaid condominium unit. Considering that the balance of the loan as of March 11, 2020 is ______________________________ (Php_______________),you feel that the amount of ______________________________ (P_____________) that you will receive in exchange for your condominium unit pursuant to the buy-back transaction is inadequate as compared to the amount that you invested in the condominium unit. Hence, in order to help diminish any further costs that you may incur, you seek confirmation that the buy-back transaction is exempt from CGT.\n\nIn reply, please be informed that Section 24 (D) (1) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, provides:\n\n\"Sec. 24. Income Tax Rates. \u2014\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(D) Capital Gains from Sale of Real Property. \u2014\n\n(1) In General. \u2014 The provisions of Section 39(B) notwithstanding, a final tax of six percent (6%) based on the gross selling price or current fair market value as determined in accordance with Section 6(E) of this Code, whichever is higher, is hereby imposed upon capital gains presumed to have been realized from the sale, exchange, or other disposition of real property located in the Philippines, classified as capital assets, including pacto de retro sales and other forms of conditional sales, by individuals, including estates and trusts: Provided, That the tax liability, if any, on gains from sales or other dispositions of real property to the government or any of its political subdivisions or agencies or to government-owned or controlled corporations shall be determined either under Section 24 (A) or under this Subsection, at the option of the taxpayer.\"\n\nWhat is involved in this case is a sale of the condominium unit from you, the seller, to DMC-UPDI, which is the buyer. Thus, the subject transaction is subject to CGT regardless of whether a gain was in fact realized considering that Section 24 (D) (1) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, imposes CGT upon capital gains which is presumed to have been realized. DETACa\n\nAlso, the buy-back transaction, being a disposition of real property under Section 24 (D) (1) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, is likewise subject to the documentary stamp taxes imposed in Section 188 and Section 196 of the same Code, as amended. (BIR Ruling No. OT-019-20)\n\nAs repeatedly held by the Supreme Court, \"laws granting exemption from tax are construed strictissimi juris against the taxpayer and liberally in favor of the taxing power. Taxation is the rule and exemption is the exception. The law does not look with favor on tax exemptions and that he who would seek to be thus privileged must justify it by words too plain to be mistaken and too categorical to be misinterpreted.\" [1]\n\nPlease be guided accordingly.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.)

                                    "Details": "Secs. 90 (C), 91 (B) and 249 of the NIRC of 1997, as amended; BIR Ruling No. 475-2017\n\nBatuhan Blando Concepcion & Trillana\n15th Floor Picadilly Star Building\n4th Avenue cor. 27th Street\nBGC, Taguig 1634\n\nAttention: AAA & BBB\n\nGentlemen :\n\nThis refers to your letter dated February 19, 2020, requesting on behalf of the heirs of CCC, for an extension of thirty (30) days within which to file the Estate Tax Return and pay the taxes due on the estate of the late CCC. HTcADC\n\nIt is represented that CCC died on February 20, 2019 in ______________________________; and that the extension is requested so it would not further impose undue hardship upon the estate of the decedent and heirs while the estate is being settled extrajudicially.\n\nIn reply thereto, please be informed that Section 90 (C) of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended, provides, viz.:\n\n\"SEC. 90. Estate Tax Returns. \u2014\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(C) Extension of Time. \u2014 The Commissioner shall have authority to grant, in meritorious cases, a reasonable extension not exceeding thirty (30) days for filing the return.\"\n\nBased on the foregoing representation, this Office finds justifiable reason to grant the request for an extension to file the estate tax return of thirty (30) days counted from February 20, 2020, which is the last day for filing of the estate tax return of the late CCC. Thus, the filing of the said estate tax return of the decedent is hereby extended up to March 21, 2020.\n\nHowever, on March 17, 2020, the entire Luzon was placed under Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ) [1] following the sharp increase in the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases throughout the country. Thus, the extension given was affected from March 17, 2020 to March 21, 2020.\n\nIn relation thereto, under Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 11-2020, the extended due date for filing BIR Form 1801 (Estate Tax Return) is thirty (30) days from the date of the lifting of the quarantine. The said RR further defined the term \"quarantine\" to mean \"any announcement by the National Government resulting to limited operations and mobility, including, but not limited to community quarantine, and general community quarantine.\" Under RR No. 12-2020, this provision was amended to exclude general community quarantine and further stated that the extended due dates under RR No. 11-2020 \"shall remain in effect regardless of any extension or modification of quarantine.\"\n\nApplying the above-mentioned provisions in the instant case, while RR No. 11-2020 as amended by RR No. 12-2020 states that the extended due date for filing estate tax return is thirty (30) days from the date of the lifting of the Modified Enhanced Community Quarantine (MECQ) on May 31, 2020, it is logical that the extension shall be limited only to five (5) days, the remaining period only affected when the entire Luzon was placed under ECQ (March 17, 2020 to March 21, 2020). Thus, filing of the estate tax return of the estate of Arch. Francisco T. Ma\u00f1osa is hereby extended up to June 05, 2020.\n\nMoreover, Section 91 (B) of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended, states that:\n\n\"SEC. 91. Payment of tax. \u2014\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(B) Extension of Time \u2014 When the Commissioner finds that the payment on the due date of the estate tax or of any part thereof would impose undue hardship upon the estate or any of the heirs, he may extend the time for payment of such tax or any part thereof not to exceed five (5) years, in case the estate is settled through the courts, or two (2) years in case the estate is extrajudicially. In such case, the amount in respect of which the extension is granted shall be paid on or before the date of the expiration of the period of the extension, and the running of the Statute of Limitations for assessment as provided in Section 203 of this Code shall be suspended for the period of any such extension.\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\nIf an extension is granted, the Commissioner may require the executor, or administrator, or beneficiary, as the case may be, to furnish a bond in such amount, not exceeding double the amount of the tax and with such sureties as the Commissioner deems necessary, conditioned upon the payment of the said tax in accordance with the terms of the extension.\"\n\nHence, since the payment on the due date of the estate tax of the estate of CCC would impose undue hardship upon the estate and the heirs while the estate is being settled extrajudicially, your request for an extension to pay the estate tax due is hereby granted. Thus, the estate tax shall be paid within two (2) years from actual filing of the estate tax return on or before June 5, 2020, whichever comes first, provided that the executor, or administrator, or beneficiary, shall furnish a bond in such amount, not exceeding double the amount of the tax and with such sureties as the Commissioner deems necessary, conditioned upon the payment of the said tax in accordance with the terms of the extension.\n\nIt shall be understood, however, that the estate shall be liable for the corresponding interest that shall have accrued thereon up to the time of payment of the estate tax due on the transmission by the said estate of its properties in favor of the heirs pursuant to Section 249 of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended.\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be ascertained that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void. aScITE\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R. DULAY\nCommissioner of Internal Revenue\n\n1. Per Memorandum from the Executive Secretary, Salvador C. Medialdea, dated March 16, 2020.",

He died on January 20, 2012. At the time of his death, he had the following foreign currency deposit accounts with the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited \u2014 Trust Department and Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited-Cebu Branch, to wit:\n\nAccount Number\n\nAccount Balance\n\nBSP Exchange Rate [1]\n\nEquivalent in Php\n\nPHP43.299\n\nPHP67.4122\n\nPHP67.4122\n\nPHP67.4122\n\nPHP43.299\n\nOn July 24, 2012, the High Court of Justice of the District Probate Registry of Manchester, England granted probate of DDD's Will and appointed HSBC Trust Company (UK) Limited as the administrator of his estate.\n\nActing on the petition for recognition of the grant of probate of the Will for the estate of DDD, the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Makati recognized the probate of DDD's Will granted by the Higher Court of Justice of the District Probate Registry of Manchester, England. Accordingly, Letters of Administration was issued by the RTC of Makati in favor of EEE, a resident of ______________________, to act as the administrator of DDD's estate in the Philippines.\n\nIn view of the foregoing, you now request for confirmation that the estate of the late DDD, a non-resident alien, consisting of foreign currency deposits in the Philippines, is exempt from estate taxes.\n\nIn reply, please be informed that pursuant to Section 85 of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended, the value of the gross estate of the decedent shall be determined by including the value at the time of his death of all property, real or personal, tangible or intangible, wherever situated: Provided, however, That in the case of a non-resident decedent who at the time of his death was not a citizen of the Philippines, only that part of the entire gross estate which is situated in the Philippines shall be included in his taxable estate.\n\nHowever, Section 1 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1246, amending Section 6 of Republic Act (RA) No. 6426, provides that:\n\n\"Section 1. Section 6 of Republic Act No. 6426, as amended, is hereby amended to read as follows:\n\nSec. 6.

Thus, the above-mentioned foreign currency deposit accounts of DDD with the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited \u2014 Trust Department and Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited-Cebu Branch are exempt from estate tax.\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented, However, if upon investigation it will be disclosed that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void.\n\n(SGD.)

(Wodel) and J-Del Investments and Management Corporation (J-Del) for confirmation of your opinion that the distribution by Wodel consisting of its treasury shares and shares of stock in K Servico Trade, Inc. (KSTI) and EMCOR, Incorporated (EMCOR) to J-Del, by way of property dividend is exempt from income tax, final tax, capital gains tax (CGT),donor's tax and value-added tax (VAT).\n\nIt is represented that Wodel (TIN __________) is a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the Philippines, with principal office address at #34 San Luis Street, Pasay City; that it has an authorized capital stock of _________________________ Pesos (P__________),composed of Four undred Thirty Million (430,000,000) common shares with a par value of _______ (P_____) per share; that it currently owns Six Hundred Thirty-Seven Thousand Fifty-Three (637,053) common shares in Wodel held as treasury shares, Fifty-Four Million Five Hundred Forty-Two Thousand Nine Hundred (54,542,900) common shares in KSTI, and Five Hundred Forty-Three Million Nine Hundred Thirty-Seven Thousand Five Hundred Twenty-Three (543,937,523) common shares in EMCOR; and that as of March 31, 2020, it has a total retained earnings of ____________________Pesos (P____________).\n\nOn the other hand, J-Del is a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the Philippines (TIN _________) with principal office address at #34 San Luis Street, Pasay City; that J-Del currently owns Two Hundred Nineteen Million One Hundred Fifty Thousand Five Hundred Ninety-Two (219,150,592) common shares in Wodel, representing ninety-nine percent (99%) ownership; and that the total carrying cost of the treasury shares of Wodel, common shares in EMCOR and common shares in KSTI amounting to ________________________ Pesos (P____________),was declared as property dividends in favor of J-Del.\n\nBased on the foregoing representations, you now request for the confirmation of the following:\n\n1. That the distribution of the shares by way of property dividend is exempt from income tax on the part of J-Del;\n\n2. That Wodel will not realize any income or gain in the distribution of the shares by way of property dividend, hence, not subject to income tax and/or CGT;\n\n3. That the distribution of the shares is not subject to donor's tax;\n\n4. That the distribution of dividend is not subject to VAT; and\n\n5. That the shares, when declared by Wodel as property dividend and received by J-Del, shall be recorded at its book/carrying value.\n\nIn reply, please be informed as follows:\n\nI. Exemption from\nIncome Tax on the\npart of J-Del\n\nSection 27 (D) (4) of the National Internal Revenue Code (Tax Code) of 1997, as amended, expressly states that:\n\n\"SEC. 27. Rates of Income Tax on Domestic Corporations.\u2014\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(D) Rates of Tax on Certain Passive Incomes. \u2014\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(4) Intercorporate Dividends. \u2014 Dividends received by a domestic corporation from another domestic corporation shall not be subject to tax.\"\n\nClearly, the distribution of property dividends made by Wodel in favor of J-Del, both being domestic corporations is not subject to income tax pursuant to Section 27 (D) (4) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended. Hence, the subject property dividends in the form of stocks in the amount of P_____________ shall not be subject to income tax and consequently to withholding tax. (BIR Ruling Nos. 277-93 dated June 28, 1993 and 197-93 dated May 7, 1993)\n\nII. Income Tax and CGT\n\nOn the part of the distributing domestic corporation, it is not liable for income tax and/or CGT considering that Wodel will not realize any income.\n\nIn distributing dividends, a corporation merely distributes its unrestricted retained earnings to its stockholders as return on capital, and thus there is no flow of wealth as to the distributing corporation. In the distribution of dividends, a corporation realized no taxable income since the distribution among stockholders is not a sale nor were assets used to discharge an indebtedness.\n\nSimilarly, the transfer made by Wodel of its treasury shares and shares in KSTI and EMCOR by way of property dividends is not deemed a sale or disposition of shares of stock within the meaning of Section 40 of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, since, Wodel did not receive any consideration and did not realize any income from the said transfer.\n\nSince Wodel will not realize any gains, it should not be liable for CGT. Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 6-2008, as amended, provides for the rules on the imposition of CGT on the stockholders, and is not applicable to the distribution of dividends.\n\nThe Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) in Trans-Asia Oil and Energy Development Corp. vs. Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CTA Case No. 9078, September 28, 2018) had occasion to rule that distribution of dividends is not covered by RR No. 6-2008 as it is an equity transaction where there could be no recognition of gain or loss, as follows:\n\n\"Clearly from all the foregoing, Petitioner's declaration and distribution of property dividends to its shareholders in the form of TAPC shares of stock is not within the ambit of the term \"other disposition of shares of stock\" in RR No. 6-2008, as amended by RR No. 6-2013. Instead, it is a mere equity transaction since petitioner did not recognize any gain or loss therefrom.\"\n\nIII. Donor's Tax\n\nWell-settled is the rule that the essential elements of a valid donation are the following: (1) the reduction of the patrimony of the donor; (2) the increase in the patrimony of the donee; and (3) the intent to do an act of liberality (animus donandi).\n\nClearly there is no donative intent on the part of Wodel to donate its treasury shares and its shares of stock in KSTI and EMCOR to J-Del since the transaction is being undertaken purely for business purposes.\n\nUnder Section 98 of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, donor's tax is imposed upon transfer by any person of a property by gift or donation inter vivos,which shall be made with a clear element of donative intent present in the transfer of property.\n\nIn the same case of Trans-Asia Oil and Energy Development Corp. vs. Commissioner of Internal Revenue,the CTA ruled that a corporation declaring dividends is not \"within the ambit of the term \"other disposition of shares of stock\" in RR No. 6-2008\" and instead as already mentioned above, is an equity transaction and thus no gain or loss, therefore, there could be \"no inadequacy of consideration to speak of,\" to wit:\n\n\"Preliminarily, the court finds that Petitioner's declaration and distribution of property dividend is not within the ambit of the term \"other disposition of shares of stock\" that would recognize gain or loss from such disposal, as contemplated in RR No. 6-2008, as amended by RR No. 6-2013.\n\nDividend has been defined in Section 73 of the NIRC of 1997, as amended, as follows:\n\n\"SEC. 73. Distribution of Dividends or Assets by Corporations. \u2014\n\n(A) Definition of Dividends. \u2014 The term 'dividends' when used in this Title means any distribution made by a corporation to its shareholders out of its earnings or profits and payable to its shareholders, whether in money or in other property.\"\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\nThe term \"dividend\" both in the technical sense and its ordinary acceptation, is that part or portion of the profits of the enterprise which the corporation, by its governing agents, sets apart for ratable division among the holders of the capital stock. It means the fund actually set aside, and declared by the directors of the corporation as dividends and duly ordered by the director, or by the stockholders at a corporate meeting, to be divided or distributed among the stockholders according to their respective interests.\n\nDividends comprise any distribution whether in cash or other property in the ordinary course of business, even though extraordinary in amount, made by a domestic or resident corporation to the stockholders out of its earnings or profits. Property dividend consists of a portion of corporate property paid to shareholders instead of cash or corporate stock.\n\nPetitioner declared and distributed property dividends to its stockholders out of its earnings or profits. The said property dividends distributed were comprised of petitioner's shares of stock/investment in its wholly-owned subsidiary, TAPC, and were recorded in Petitioner's books at its carrying/book value. In recording the property dividends at their carrying/book value, there was no profit or gain realized or recognized in the transaction.\"\n\nIV. VAT\n\nSection 106 of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, states that:\n\n\"Sec. 106. Value-Added Tax on Sale of Goods or Properties. \u2014\n\n(A) Rate and Base of Tax. \u2014 There shall be levied, assessed and collected on every sale, barter or exchange of goods or properties, a value-added tax equivalent to ten percent of the gross selling price or gross value in money of the goods or properties sold, bartered or exchanged, such tax to be paid by the seller or transferor: Provided, That the President upon the recommendation of the Secretary of Finance, shall effective January 1, 2006, raise the rate of value-added tax to twelve percent (12%) ...\"\n\nAccordingly, Section 4.106-8 of RR No. 16-2005, as amended, provides:\n\n\"(a) Subject to output tax\n\nThe VAT provided for in Sec. 106 of the Tax Code shall apply to goods or properties originally intended for sale or use in business, and capital goods which are existing as of the occurrence of the following. . .\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(b) Not subject to output tax\n\nThe VAT shall not apply to goods or properties existing as of the occurrence of the following:\n\n(1) Change of control of a corporation by the acquisition of the controlling interest of such corporation by another stockholder or group of stockholders. The goods or properties used in business or those comprising the stock-in-trade of the corporation, having a change in corporate control, will not be considered sold, bartered or exchanged despite the change in the ownership interest in the said corporation.\"\n\nConsidering that Wodel shares are not held primarily for sale, barter or exchange in the ordinary course of its trade or business, the transfer by Wodel to J-Del of the subject shares is not subject to 12% VAT. (BIR Ruling No. 024-05 dated December 23, 2005)\n\nV. Recording\nbook/carrying value\n\nAs regards your opinion that the shares to be declared should be recorded in the books of the distributing and receiving corporation, the Court of Tax Appeals in Trans-Asia Oil and Energy Development Corp. vs. Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CTA Case No. 9078, September 28, 2018), has allowed the recording of the shares to be distributed as property dividends at book/carrying value.\n\nBased on all of the foregoing, it is our considered view that property dividends in the character of intercorporate dividends from one domestic corporation to another domestic corporation are exempt from income tax under Sec. 27 (D) (4) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, exempt from CGT under Section 27 (D) (7) (c) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, donor's tax under Section 99 of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended and VAT under Section 105 of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended. This Office also confirms that the shares shall be recorded in the books of both distributor and receiving corporations at book/carrying value, provided that the book value of the shares distributed must be annotated at the back of the Certificate of Stocks which shall serve as the basis of the computation of the tax upon its subsequent disposition. (BIR Ruling No. 1011-2018 dated June 13, 2018)\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be disclosed that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void.\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R. DULAY\nCommissioner of Internal Revenue",

Strong reasons of policy support a strict observance of the rule regarding the payment of tax. The laws imposing penalties for delinquencies are clearly intended to hasten tax payments or punish evasions or neglect of duty in respect thereof. If delays in tax payments are to be condoned for light reasons, the law imposing penalties for delinquencies would be rendered nugatory and the maintenance of the government and its multifarious activities would be as precarious as taxpayers are willing or unwilling to pay their obligations to the state on time. [1] This is justified because the intention of the law is precisely to discourage delay in the payment of taxes due to the State and, in this sense, the surcharge and interest charged are not penal but compensatory in nature. They are compensation to the State for the delay in payment of the tax and for the concomitant use by the taxpayer of the funds that rightfully should be in the government's hands. [2]\n\nMoreover, under Section 204 (B) of the Tax Code, as amended, the Commissioner may abate or cancel tax liability only in two (2) cases, viz.:(a) the tax or any portion thereof appears to be unjustly or excessively assessed; or (b) the administration and collection costs involved do not justify the collection of the amount due. It has also been held that a voluntary relinquishment of a part of a tax lawfully assessed upon and due from a solvent person or corporation is not permitted by law. [3]\n\nThus, in the matter of abatement of penalties, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue should not act from motives merely out of compassion or charity, but should consider the pecuniary interest of the government, justice and equity and public policy. Good faith alone may not be sufficient to avoid the 25% surcharge which is designated to ensure timely compliance with the law. [4]\n\nIt is compensation to the State for the delay in the payment or for the concomitant use of the funds by the taxpayer beyond the date he is supposed to have paid them to the State. [5]\n\nIN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, this Office regrets to deny your request for the waiver or condonation of the penalties, interest, and/or surcharges due to the one (1)-day late payment of DST.\n\nPlease be guided accordingly.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.)

Hence, this request for extension of time.\n\nIn reply, please be informed that Section 91 (B) of the National Internal Revenue Code (Tax Code) of 1997, as amended, provides, viz:\n\n\"Section. 91. Payment of tax. \u2014\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(B) Extension of Time. \u2014 When the Commissioner finds that the payment on the due date of the estate tax or of any part thereof would impose undue hardship upon the estate or any of the heirs, he may extend the time for payment of such tax or any part thereof not to exceed five (5) years, in case the estate is settled through the courts, or two (2) years in case the estate is settled extrajudicially. In such case, the amount in respect of which the extension is granted shall be paid on or before the date of the expiration of the period of the extension, and the running of the Statute of Limitations for assessment as provided in Section 203 of this Code shall be suspended for the period of any such extension.\"\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\nBased on the foregoing justifiable reason, and in conformity with the above-quoted provision, this Office hereby grants the request for extension of time within which to pay the estate tax up to the maximum period of two (2) years or five (5) years, whichever is applicable, reckoned from the actual filing of the estate tax return, provided that the executor, or administrator, or beneficiaries, shall furnish a bond in such amount, not exceeding double the amount of the tax and with such sureties as the Commissioner deems necessary, conditioned upon the payment of the said tax in accordance with the terms of the extension. [1]\n\nIt shall be understood, however, that the estate shall be liable for the corresponding interest that shall have accrued thereon up to the time of payment of the estate tax due on the transmission by the said estate of its properties in favor of the heirs pursuant to Section 249 of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended. [2]\n\nInsofar as the donor's tax is concerned, this Office is constrained to deny your request for lack of legal basis.\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be disclosed that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R.

Income Payments Subject to Creditable Withholding Tax and Rates Prescribed Thereon. \u2014 Except as herein otherwise provided, there shall be withheld a creditable income tax at the rates herein specified for each class of payee from the following items of income payments to persons residing in the Philippines: cTDaEH\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(C) Income payments to certain contractors \u2014 On gross payments to the following contractors, whether individual or corporate \u2014 Two percent (2%).\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(2) General Building contractors \u2014 Those whose principal contracting business is in connection with any structure built, for the support, shelter and enclosure of persons, animals, chattels, or movable property of any kind, requiring in its construction the use of more than two unrelated building trades or crafts, or to do or superintend the whole or any part thereto. Such structure includes sewers and sewerage disposal plants and systems, parks, playgrounds, and other recreational works, refineries, chemical plants and similar industrial plants requiring specialized engineering knowledge and skills, powerhouse, power plants and other utility plants and installation, mines and metallurgical plants, cement and concrete works in connection with the above-mentioned fixed works.\n\n(3) Specialty Contractors \u2014 Those whose operations pertain to the performance of construction work requiring special skill and whose principal contracting business involves the use of specialized building trades or crafts.\"\n\nThe above provision categorically enumerated the types of contractor to which withholding tax of 2% is imposable, including therein both General Engineering Contractors and Specialty Contractors.\n\nIn BIR Ruling No. 006-03 dated August 15, 2003, this Office ruled that for the purpose of withholding tax, an independent firm of quantity surveyors, cost engineers and construction cost specialists, is considered a specialty contractor. In the said ruling, the company renders quantity surveying services in building and other civil works projects including, but not limited to, initial design, tendering procedures and contract arrangements, cost studies and planning, master development programming, tender contract analysis and report, construction progress financial statement preparation, advisory contract administration, valuation of construction work in progress and cost and material supervision in each and every work phase of construction, which services pertain to the performance of construction work requiring special skill. Notwithstanding the fact that the company does not perform actual construction work, it was considered a specialty contractor, because its principal contracting business involves the use of specialized building trades or crafts. Accordingly, the said ruling states that as a specialty contractor, the professional fees that the company receives for quantity surveying services are subject to creditable withholding tax at the rate of 2% in accordance with RR No. 2-98, as amended.\n\nBased on the foregoing, this Office opines that 515 Life Construction Services is considered as specialty contractor since its line of business requires special skills, such as soil testing, laboratory and analysis, preparation and submission of final geotechnical report, highway and bridge detailed engineering design, topographic survey, bridge site survey, sub surface soil exploration works and geotechnical investigation, generally carrying activities in conjunction with and related to any of the services of a specialty contractor. Hence, all income payments received by 515 Life Construction Services as specialty contractor are subject to creditable withholding tax at the rate of 2% pursuant to Sec. 2.57.2 (C) (3) of RR No. 2-98, as amended by RR No. 11-2018.\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be disclosed that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void. cSaATC\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R.

(\"iPeople\") is a corporation duly organized under Philippine laws and registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") on July 27, 1989 as a holding company. It has an authorized capital stock of Two Billion Pesos (PHP2,000,000,000.00) divided into Two Billion (2,000,000,000) common shares, with a par value of One Peso (PHP1.00) each. Out of this authorized capital stock, Seven Hundred Forty-Eight Million Nine Hundred Thirty-Two Thousand Nine Hundred Forty-Nine Pesos (PHP748,932,949.00), divided into Seven Hundred Forty-Eight Million Nine Hundred Thirty-Two Thousand Nine Hundred Forty-Nine (748,932,949) shares, are issued and outstanding with Two Hundred Seventy-Two (272) shares held in Treasury.\n\niPeople's shares are listed on the Philippine Stock Exchange and are traded as Initial Public Offering (\"IPO\").\n\niPeople's primary purpose is to invest in, or otherwise acquire and own, sell, assign, transfer, mortgage, pledge, exchange or otherwise dispose of real and personal property of every kind and description, including shares of stock, subscriptions, bonds, debentures, notes, evidence of indebtedness, and other securities or obligations of any corporation or corporations, association or associations, domestic or foreign, especially those intended for or engaged mainly in the information technology and allied or related business, running, managing or operating schools or educational and training centers or institutions specializing in information technology, electronic commerce, internet service, and various fields of engineering.\n\niPeople owns and has investments in various schools, colleges and universities, including:\n\n(a) Malayan Education System, Inc. (Operating under the name of Map\u00faa University) (MESI); CAIHTE\n\n(b) Pan Pacific Computer Center, Inc. (PPCC); and\n\n(c) People eServe Corporation (PEC)\n\n2. AC Education, Inc. (\"AEI\") is a corporation duly organized under Philippine laws and registered with the SEC on October 19, 2012. It has an authorized capital stock of Two Billion One Hundred Fifty Million Pesos (PHP2,150,000,000.00) divided into Two Billion One Hundred Fifty Million (2,150,000,000) common shares, with a par value of One Peso (PHP1.00) each. Out of this authorized capital stock, One Billion Nine Hundred Ninety-Three Million Four Hundred Seventy-Seven Thousand Three Hundred and Thirty-Eight Pesos (PHP1,993,477,338.00) divided into One Billion Nine Hundred Ninety-Three Million Four Hundred Seventy-Seven Thousand Three Hundred and Thirty-Eight (1,993,477,338) shares were subscribed to at a premium and fully paid up.\n\nAEI is organized primarily to invest in schools, colleges and universities and also to provide services oriented towards the promotion of service management, including but not limited to the design, marketing, management, and/or conduct of seminars, convention, courses, conferences, specialty programs, symposia of service management excellence, by itself or in partnership with other entities or institutions except management of funds, securities, portfolios or similar assets managed entity, without operating a school.\n\nAEI also has investments in various schools, colleges and universities, including:\n\n(a) Affordable Private Education Center, Inc. doing business under the name of APEC Schools (APEC);\n\n(b) University of Nueva Caceres (UNC);\n\n(c) The National Teachers College (NTC);\n\n(d) AC College of Enterprise and Technology, Inc. (ACCET); and\n\n(e) LINC Institute, Inc. Doing Business under the Name and Style of \"LINC Academy\" (LINC)\n\nIn addition, AEI has an existing cooperation agreement with Jose Rizal University (JRU) for the implementation of various senior high school and college programs under the Professional Employment Program (PEP).\n\n3. On October 1, 2018, each of the Board of Directors of iPeople and AEI, approved the Articles and Plan of Merger between iPeople and AEI, with iPeople as the Surviving Corporation and AEI as the Absorbed Corporation. These were subsequently ratified by the stockholders of iPeople and AEI on December 12, 2018 and December 5, 2018, respectively, in the special and annual stockholders' meetings of the constituent corporations.\n\n4. iPeople and AEI are merging pursuant to Sections 76 to 80 of the Corporation Code and Section 40 (c) (2) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, with iPeople as the Surviving Corporation and AEI as the Absorbed Corporation, for the following business reasons:\n\n(i) To enable accelerated growth and provide stronger academic offerings and career prospects for the students of iPeople's and AEI's schools; DETACa\n\n(ii) To broaden the suite of program offerings and widen the geographic reach of the iPeople's and AEI's schools; and\n\n(iii) To unlock synergies between iPeople and AEI to be able to deliver quality education, aimed not only at educating the Filipino youth but also at preparing their graduates to become major players in sustainable businesses driven by adaptive technology, by arming them with the values, critical thinking, global mindset and 21st century skills that are necessary to succeed in this rapidly changing world.\n\n5. Prior to the merger, the outstanding shares of stock in the constituent corporations are in the names of the stockholders of iPeople and AEI.\n\n6. The assets, liabilities and stockholders' equity of the constituent corporations based on the audited financial statements (AFS) of AEI and iPeople as of December 31, 2018 are summarized, as follows:\n\niPeople (in Php)\n\nAEI (in Php)\n\nAssets\n\n_____________\n\n_____________\n\nLiabilities\n\n_____________\n\n_____________\n\nStockholders' Equity\n\n_____________\n\n_____________\n\n7. Pursuant to the merger, all the assets and liabilities of AEI shall be conveyed, assigned, and transferred to iPeople solely in exchange for shares of stock in iPeople.\n\nSpecifically, in exchange for the transfer of the net assets of AEI to iPeople, the latter shall issue to the shareholders of AEI an aggregate of Two Hundred Ninety-Five Million Three Hundred Twenty-Nine Thousand Nine Hundred Seventy-Six (295,329,976) shares out of the unissued portion of its authorized capital stock, with a total par value of Two Hundred Ninety-Five Million Three Hundred Twenty-Nine Thousand Nine Hundred Seventy-Six Pesos (PHP295,329,976.00).\n\nThe difference between (i) the fair value of AEI's net asset, and (ii) the total par value of the iPeople shares to be issued to the AEI's shareholders shall be recorded as additional paid in capital (APIC) in the books of iPeople.\n\n8. Accordingly, the total outstanding capital stock of iPeople after the merger shall be recorded in the name of the stockholders of iPeople.\n\n9. The constituent corporations have filed with the SEC the Articles and Plan of Merger on February 8, 2018, which was approved on April 24, 2019.\n\nIn view thereof, you now request for confirmation of the following:\n\nA. The statutory merger between AEI and iPeople, whereby all the assets and liabilities of AEI will be transferred to iPeople in exchange for shares in iPeople is a merger within the contemplation of Section 40 (C) (2) (a) and (b) in relation to Section 40 (C) (6) (b) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended. As such, the transaction qualifies as a tax-free exchange and no gain or loss should be recognized by:\n\n(1) AEI, as the transferor, on the assignment of all its assets and liabilities to iPeople; aDSIHc\n\n(2) iPeople, as the transferee, on its receipt of the assets and liabilities of AEI; and\n\n(3) AEI's shareholders, who will surrender their shares in AEI for shares in iPeople;\n\nB. The substituted basis of the shares of stock of iPeople received by AEI shall be determined in accordance with Section 40 (C) (5) (a) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended. Similarly, the substituted basis of the properties received by iPeople from AEI shall be determined in accordance with Section 40 (C) (5) (b) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended;\n\nC. The transfer by AEI of its assets to iPeople, and the surrender of the shares by its shareholders, in exchange for the shares of iPeople is not motivated by donative intent, but is effected solely for legitimate business purposes. The transaction is therefore not a donation subject to donor's tax;\n\nD. Pursuant to Section 199 (m) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, the transfer of properties by AEI to iPeople is not subject to documentary stamp tax (DST). The surrender of the shares of stock by the stockholders of AEI in complete cancellation thereof is also not subject to DST. However, the original issuance of iPeople shares to the stockholders of AEI as a consequence of the merger shall be subject to DST in accordance with Section 174 of the same Code;\n\nE. Following Section 4.106-8 (b) (3) of Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 16-2005, as amended, the transfer of assets by AEI pursuant to the merger is likewise not subject to 12% value added tax (VAT), and any unused input VAT of AEI as of the effective date of merger will be transferred to and absorbed by iPeople;\n\nF. The excess and unutilized creditable withholding taxes (CWT) of AEI as of the effective date of the merger shall be transferred to and vested in iPeople. This may be applied as a tax credit by iPeople against its income tax liabilities for 2019 and succeeding years or may be the subject of a claim for refund or issuance of a tax credit certificate (TCC);\n\nG. Any excess MCIT of AEI as of the effective date of merger shall be transferred to and vested in iPeople. Pursuant to Section 27 (E) (2) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, this may be carried forward and credited by iPeople against its normal income tax liability for the three immediately succeeding taxable years reckoned from the date of payment of the MCIT by AEI; and\n\nH. Any excess and unexpired net operating loss carry-over (NOLCO) of AEI shall not form part of its assets to be transferred to iPeople pursuant to the merger.\n\nIn reply thereto, please be informed, as follows:\n\n1. The foregoing merger of AEI and iPeople is a merger within the contemplation of Section 40 (C) (2) (a) in relation to 40 (C) (6) (b) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, because iPeople shall acquire/assume all the assets and liabilities of AEI to enable accelerated growth and provide stronger academic offerings and career prospects for the students of iPeople's and AEI's schools; to broaden the suite of program offerings and widen the geographic reach of the iPeople's and AEI's schools; and to unlock synergies between iPeople and AEI to be able to deliver quality education, aimed not only at educating the Filipino youth but also at preparing their graduates to become major players in sustainable businesses driven by adaptive technology, by arming them with the values, critical thinking, global mindset and 21st century skills that are necessary to succeed in this rapidly changing world. Hence, the merger of AEI and iPeople is being undertaken for a bona fide business purpose and not for the purpose of escaping the burden of taxation.\n\nThe merger of AEI and iPeople qualifies for non-recognition of gain or loss for income tax purposes in accordance with Section 40 (C) (2) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, that no gain or loss shall be recognized by AEI, as the transferor of all assets and liabilities, to iPeople pursuant to the Plan of Merger.\n\nAccordingly, no gain or loss shall be recognized by iPeople, as the transferee, on its receipt of the assets and liabilities of AEI pursuant to and as a consequence of the merger.\n\nOn the other hand, the bases of the shares of stocks to be received by the shareholders of AEI upon the exchange shall be the same as the bases of the properties, stocks or securities exchanged, decreased by (1) the money received, and (2) the fair market value of the other property/ies received and increased by (a) the amount treated as dividend of the shareholders and (b) the amount of any gain that was recognized in the exchange. (Sec. 40 (C) (5) (a) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended)\n\nThe basis of the properties transferred in the hands of the transferee (iPeople) listed in Annex \"A\" hereof, shall be the same as it would be in the hands of the transferor (AEI) increased by the amount of the gain, if any, recognized to the transferor (AEI) on the transfer. (Sec. 40 (C) (5) (b), supra)\n\nFinally, if the amount of the liabilities assumed plus the amount of the liabilities to which the property is subject exceed the total of the adjusted basis of the properties transferred pursuant to such exchange, then such excess shall be considered as a gain, on the part of the transferor, from the sale or exchange of a capital asset or of property which is not a capital asset, as the case may be. (Sec. 40 (C) (4) (b), supra)\n\nThe substituted basis of the properties transferred by AEI to iPeople shall comply with the rule that cash and other cash items will be excluded from the computation of the adjusted basis of the properties transferred for purposes of determining whether liabilities assumed and to which the property is subject do not exceed the adjusted basis of the property transferred pursuant to No. IV (A) (2) of Revenue Memorandum Ruling (RMR) No. 2-2002 dated June 10, 2002.\n\nAccordingly, the allocated shares and liabilities, and the substituted basis of the assets transferred by AEI to iPeople, based on AEI's audited financial statements as of December 31, 2018 shall be as follows: cSEDTC\n\nAmount\n(in Php)\n\nAllocated Liabilities\n\nAllocated Shares\n\nSubstituted Basis (in Php)\n\nCash and Cash Equivalents\n\n___________\n\n___________\n\n___________\n\nAccounts and other Receivables\n\n___________\n\n___________\n\n___________\n\n___________\n\nOther current assets\n\n___________\n\n___________\n\n___________\n\n___________\n\nInvestments in subsidiaries\n\n___________\n\n___________\n\n___________\n\n___________\n\nProperty and equipment\n\n___________\n\n___________\n\n___________\n\n___________\n\nTOTAL\n\n___________\n\n___________\n\n___________\n\n___________\n\nLiabilities\n\nAmount (in Php)\n\nAccounts and other payables\n\n___________\n\nUnearned revenues\n\n___________\n\nPension liabilities\n\n___________\n\nTOTAL\n\n___________\n\n2. Well-settled in our jurisprudence is the fact that the essential elements of a valid donation are: (1) the reduction of the patrimony of the donor, (2) the increase in the patrimony of the donee, and (3) the intent to do an act of liberality (animus donandi).\n\nClearly, there is no intention on the part of any of the parties to the merger \u2014 AEI to donate to iPeople its assets since the transaction is purely for legitimate business purpose. Thus, the aforesaid merger will not be subject to gift tax since there is no intention to donate, and the transaction is a bonafide merger effected solely for business reasons.\n\n3. No DST is due on the transfer of assets made pursuant to the Plan of Merger under Section 199 (m) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended by Republic Act No. 9243, in relation to Section 40 (C) (2) of the Tax Code, as amended. (BIR Ruling No. S40-0427-2020 dated July 30, 2020)\n\nIn the case of Pilipinas Shell Petroleum Corporation vs. Commissioner of Internal Revenue (C.T.A. Case No. 6477 dated April 20, 2003), the Court stated that all the integral parts of the merger including the surrender of shares in exchange for shares, should be treated as a single and continuing transaction subject only to one DST. The Court held, as follows:\n\n\"As earlier stated, DST is in the nature of an excise tax because it is really imposed on the privilege to enter into a transaction. Its imposition, therefore, should be only once. And in a statutory merger, there is only one transaction, i.e., the issuance by the surviving corporation of its own shares of stock to the stockholders of the absorbed corporation in exchange for the shares surrendered by the shareholders of the absorbed corporation. All other transactions which are an integral and inherent part of the merger, such as the absorption of real property, should no longer be subject to another round of DST. In other words, all the integral parts of the merger (e.g., surrender of shares in exchange for shares, transfer of assets, assumption of liabilities, etc.) should be treated as a single and continuing transaction subject only to one DST. The transfer of real property is not a transaction separate and distinct from the merger but an integral part or a mere continuation of the initial transaction which was previously consummated.\"\n\nHowever, a DST at the rate of P2.00 on each P200 par value, or fractional part thereof, shall be imposed on the original issuance of shares by iPeople to the stockholders of AEI as a consequence of the merger as provided under Section 174 of the Tax Code, as amended.\n\n4. The transfer of properties of AEI to iPeople as a consequence of the merger shall not be subject to any output tax, pursuant to Section 4.109-1 (B) (1) (x) of Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 13-2018, since the said transfer is considered a VAT-exempt transaction under Section 34 of Republic Act (RA) No. 10963. The conveyance of properties to effectuate a merger is not made in the course of business but by operation of law pursuant to the merger. Thus, any unused input tax as of the effective date of merger will be absorbed by iPeople, as the surviving corporation pursuant to Section 4.106-8 (b) (3) of RR No. 16-2005, as amended by RRs No. 4-2007 and 10-2011. SDAaTC\n\n5. Any excess and unutilized creditable withholding taxes (CWT), which form part of the assets to be transferred by AEI as of the effective date of the merger, shall be transferred to and vested in iPeople, as the surviving corporation, and such excess CWT may be utilized by the latter against its income tax liabilities for 2019 and succeeding years or may be the subject of a claim for refund or issuance of a tax credit certificate (TCC). (BIR Ruling No. 100-2017 dated March 2, 2017)\n\n6. The excess and unexpired Minimum Corporate Income Tax (MCIT) of the absorbed corporation, AEI, as of the effective date of the merger, shall be carried forward and credited against the normal income tax due of the surviving corporation, iPeople, for the three (3) immediately succeeding taxable years pursuant to Section 27 (E) (2) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended. Since the excess and unexpired MCIT of AEI, is among the rights, privileges, property and/or interest of AEI, the excess and unexpired MCIT of the latter shall be transferred to and vested in iPeople on the effective date of the merger. Thus, AEI's excess and unexpired MCIT shall be carried forward and credited against the normal corporate income tax of iPeople subject to the three-year-carry-forward period reckoned from the date of payment of AEI of its MCIT.\n\n7. It is to be emphasized, however, that the net operating loss carry-over (NOLCO) under Section 34 (D) (3) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, and as implemented by RR No. 14-2001, of AEI, if any, is not one of their assets that can be transferred and absorbed by the surviving corporation, iPeople, as this privilege or deduction can be availed of by AEI only. Accordingly, the tax-free merger between AEI and iPeople does not cover the NOLCO of the former.\n\n8. The retained earnings of the absorbed corporation, if any, shall be subject to ten percent (10%) final withholding tax on dividends constructively received by its individual shareholders pursuant to Section 24 (B) (2) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended. (BIR Ruling No. 1422-18 dated December 7, 2018)\n\nIn order that the above-described reorganization can be considered as merger under Section 40 (C) (2) and (6) (b) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, the parties to the merger should comply with the following requirements set forth under RR No. 18-2001:\n\nA. The plan of reorganization should be adopted by each of the corporations, parties thereto, the adoption being shown by the acts of its duly constituted responsible officers and appearing upon the official records of the corporation. Each corporation, which is a party to the reorganization, shall file, as part of its return for the taxable year within which the reorganization occurred a complete statement of all facts pertinent to the non-recognition of gain or loss in connection with the reorganization, including:\n\n1. A copy of the plan of reorganization, together with a statement executed under the penalties of perjury, showing in full the purposes thereof and in detail all transactions incident to, or pursuant to the plan;\n\n2. A complete statement of all cost or other basis of all property, including all stocks or securities, transferred incident to the plan;\n\n3. A statement of the amount of stock or securities and other property or money received from the exchange, including a statement of all distribution of other disposition made thereof. The amount of each kind of stock or securities and other property received shall be stated on the basis of the fair market value thereof at the date of the exchange;\n\n4. A statement of the amount and nature of any liabilities assumed upon the exchange, and the amount and nature of any liabilities to which any of the property acquired in the exchange is subject. acEHCD\n\nB. Every taxpayer, other than a corporation, party to the reorganization, who received stock or securities and other property or money upon a tax-free exchange in connection with a corporate reorganization shall incorporate in his income tax return for the taxable year in which the exchange takes place a complete statement of all facts pertinent to the non-recognition of gain or loss upon such exchange, including:\n\n1. A statement of the cost or other basis of the stock or securities transferred in the exchange; and\n\n2. A statement in full of the amount of stock or securities and other property or money received from the exchange, including any liabilities assumed upon the exchange, and any liabilities to which property received is subject. The amount of each kind of stock or securities and other property (other liabilities assumed upon the exchange) received shall be set forth upon the basis of the fair market value thereof at the date of the exchange.\n\nC. Records in substantial form shall be kept by every taxpayer who participates in a tax-free exchange in connection with a corporate reorganization showing the cost or other basis of the transferred property or money received (including any liabilities assumed on the exchange, or any liabilities to which any of the properties received were subject), in order to facilitate the determination of gain or loss from subsequent disposition of such stock or securities and other property received from the exchange.\n\nIn addition to the foregoing requirements, the parties shall enclose with their respective income tax returns for the taxable year in which the merger occurred a copy of the request for ruling filed with, and the corresponding ruling issued by, the Bureau of Internal Revenue, both duly stamp-received by the appropriate office of the Bureau of Internal Revenue.\n\nSuch parties shall include as a note to their respective audited financial statements for the taxable year in which the merger occurred a statement to the effect that they hold such assets/shares acquired in a merger and the year in which such merger occurred, and in the taxable years until the subject properties are subsequently transferred to another transferee.\n\nMoreover, the shareholders of the absorbed/dissolving corporation and the surviving/transferee corporation shall record in their respective books of accounts the mandatory accounting entries stated in Annex \"B\" hereof, pursuant to Revenue Memorandum Order (RMO) No. 17-2016.\n\nThe parties shall cause to annotate at the back of the Transfer Certificates of Title and Certificates of Stock, the date the merger was executed, the original/historical/adjusted costs of acquisition of the properties or shares of stock involved, and the fact that no gain or loss was recognized as a result of such merger; provided however, that any violation by the Corporate Secretary of this condition shall be penalized under Section 275 of the same Code. It is further required that within ninety (90) days from receipt of this ruling, the parties to the transaction must submit to the Legal and Legislative Division, Bureau of Internal Revenue, proof of annotation of the original/historical/adjusted bases of the properties and/or real properties involved in the transfer and certified true copies by the Corporate Secretary, of duly annotated Certificates of Stock, in respect of the shares of stock of the transferee corporation, including the revised allocation of shares and re-computation of the substituted bases of the properties which shall be in accordance with RMR No. 2-2002. SDHTEC\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be disclosed that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R.

In such case, the amount in respect of which the extension is granted shall be paid on or before the date of the expiration of the period of the extension, and the running of the Statute of Limitations for assessment as provided in Section 203 of this Code shall be suspended for the period of any such extension.\n\nxxx xxx xxx\"\n\nBased on the foregoing representations, this Office finds justifiable reason to grant the request for an extension to file the estate tax return of thirty (30) days counted from September 21, 2019, which is the last day for filing of the estate tax return of the Decedent. Thus, the filing of the said estate tax return of the decedent is hereby extended up to October 21, 2019.\n\nMoreover, the request for extension of the time of four (4) years within which to pay the estate tax is hereby granted, reckoned from the actual filing of the estate tax return and no later than October 21, 2023,provided that the executor, or administrator, or beneficiary, shall furnish a bond in such amount, not exceeding double the amount of the tax and with such sureties as the Commissioner deems necessary, conditioned upon the payment of the said tax in accordance with the terms of the extension.\n\nIt shall be understood, however, that the estate shall be liable for the corresponding interest that shall have accrued thereon up to the time of payment of the estate tax due on the transmission by the said estate of its properties in favor of the heirs pursuant to Section 249 of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended.\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be disclosed that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R.

Exception. \u2014 The tax imposed by Title II shall not apply to employees' trust which forms part of a pension, stock bonus, or profit-sharing plan of an employer for the benefit of some or all of his employees (1) if contributions are made to the trust by such employer, or employees, or both for the purpose of distributing to such employees the earnings and principal of the fund accumulated by the trust in accordance with such plan, and (2) if under the trust instrument it is impossible, at any time prior to the satisfaction of all liabilities with respect to employees under the trust, for any part of the corpus or income to be (within the taxable year or thereafter) used for, or diverted to, purposes other than for the exclusive benefit of his employees . . .\"\n\nThe above-cited provision lays down the following requirements in order that the earnings of a retirement fund may be exempt from income tax, to wit: 1) the contributions are made to the trust by the employer, or employees, or both; 2) such contributions are made for the purpose of distributing to such employees the earnings and principal of the fund accumulated by the trust in accordance with such plan; and 3) under the trust instrument it is impossible (in the taxable year and at any time thereafter prior to the satisfaction of all liabilities with respect to employees under the trust) for any part of the corpus or income to be used for, or diverted to, purposes other than for the exclusive benefit of the employees. It is noted that the foregoing conditions are present in PERAA, thus, it is exempt from income tax. Since the final tax and the withholding thereof are embraced within the title on \"Income Tax,\" it follows that said trust is exempt from the coverage of the withholding tax regulations.\n\nIn the case of Commissioner of Internal Revenue vs. Court of Appeals, [1] the Supreme Court upheld the judgment of the respondent Court of Appeals in affirming the decision of the Court of Tax Appeals, which ruled:\n\n\". . . it is significant to note that the GCL Plan was qualified as exempt from income tax by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue in accordance with Republic Act (R.A.) No. 4917 approved on June 17, 1967. This law specifically provided.\n\n'Sec. 1. Any provision of law to the contrary notwithstanding, the retirement benefits received by officials and employees of private firms, whether individual or corporate, in accordance with a reasonable private benefit plan maintained by the employer shall be exempt from all taxes and shall not be liable to attachment, levy or seizure by or under any legal or equitable process whatsoever except to pay a debt of the official or employee concerned to the private benefit plan or that arising from liability imposed in a criminal action;'\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\nAnd rightly so, by virtue of the raison d'etre behind the creation of employees' trusts. Employees' trusts or benefit plans normally provide economic assistance to employees upon occurrence of certain contingencies, particularly, old age retirement, death, sickness, or disability. It provides security against certain hazards to which members of the Plan may be exposed. It is an independent and additional source of protection for the working group. What is more, it is established for their exclusive benefit and for no other purpose.\n\nThe tax advantage in R.A. No. 1983, Section 56(b), was conceived in order to encourage the formation and establishment of such private plans for the benefit of laborers and employees outside of the Social Security Act. Enlightening is a portion of the explanatory note to H.B. No. 6503, now R.A. 1983, reading:\n\n'Considering that under Section 17 of the Social Security Act, all contributions collected and payments of sickness, unemployment, retirement, disability and death benefits made thereunder together with the income of the pension trust are exempt from any tax, assessment, fee, or charge, it is proposed that a similar system providing for retirement, etc. benefits for employees outside the Social Security Act be exempted from income taxes.' (Congressional Record, House of Representatives, Vol. IV, Part 2, No. 57, p. 1859, May 3, 1957; cited in Commissioner of Internal Revenue vs. Visayan Electric Co., et al., G.R. No. L-22611, May 27, 1968, 23 SCRA 715).\n\nIt is evident that tax exemption is likewise to be enjoyed by the income of the pension trust. Otherwise, taxation of those earnings would result in a diminution of accumulated income and reduce whatever the trust beneficiaries would receive out of the trust fund. This would run afoul of the very intent of the law.\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\nThere can be no denying either that the final withholding tax is collected from income in respect of which employees' trusts are declared exempt (Sec. 56(b), now Sec. 53 (b), Tax Code). The application of the withholding system to interest on bank deposits or yield from deposit substitutes is essentially to maximize and expedite the collection of income taxes by requiring its payment at the source. If an employees' trust like the GCL enjoys a tax-exempt status from income, we see no logic in withholding a certain percentage of that income which it is not supposed to pay in the first place.\n\nxxx xxx xxx\"\n\nConsidering that PERAA is an employee's trust fund established for the exclusive benefit of its member-employees/officials and the corpus or income of the fund is not used for or diverted to purposes other than for the exclusive benefit of its member-employees/officials or their beneficiaries, this Office rules that the PERAA is considered an employees' trust and, therefore, income of the trust fund from its investments is exempt from income tax and consequently from withholding tax pursuant to Section 60 (B) of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended. Accordingly, the Deed of Absolute Sale dated March 12, 2015 executed by The Members of the Board of Trustees of PERAA, in their capacities as Trustees, in favor of RJOSEPH XII, INC. is not subject to income tax/CGT/withholding tax pursuant to Section 60 (B) of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended.\n\nHowever, it is to be noted that a retirement fund or pension trust is only entitled to exemption from income tax under Section 60 (B) of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended. Thus, it may still be subject to other applicable taxes imposed under other provisions of the same Code. In this case at hand, based on Tax Declaration No. E-027-04695 which was issued by the City Assessor of Makati City, the actual use of the subject property is for commercial purpose. Accordingly, the sale of the subject property to RJOSEPH XII, INC. is subject to value-added tax (VAT) pursuant to Section 106 of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended.\n\nLastly, it is also subject to the documentary stamp taxes (DST) imposed in Section 188 and Section 196 of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended.\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be disclosed that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R.

Joint Ventures Not Taxable as Corporations. \u2014 A joint venture or consortium formed for the purpose of undertaking construction projects which is not considered as corporation under Section 22 of the NIRC of 1997 as amended, should be:\n\n(1) for the undertaking of a construction project; and\n\n(2) should involve joining or pooling of resources by licensed local contractors; that is, licensed as general contractor by the Philippine Contractors Accreditation Board (PCAB) of the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI);\n\n(3) the local contractors are engaged in construction business; and\n\n(4) the Joint Venture itself must likewise be duly licensed as such by the Philippine Contractors Accreditation Board (PCAB) of the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI).\n\nJoint ventures involving foreign contractors may also be treated as a non-taxable corporation only if the member foreign contractor is covered by a special license as contractor by the Philippine Contractors Accreditation Board (PCAB) of the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI);and the construction project is certified by the appropriate Tendering Agency (government office) that the project is a foreign financed/internationally-funded project and that international bidding is allowed under the Bilateral Agreement entered into by and between the Philippine Government and the foreign/international financing institution pursuant to the implementing rules and regulations of Republic Act No. 4566 otherwise known as Contractor's License Law.\n\nAbsent any one of the aforesaid requirements, the joint venture or consortium formed for the purpose of undertaking construction projects shall be considered as taxable corporations. In addition, the tax-exempt joint venture or consortium as herein defined shall not include those who are mere suppliers of goods, services or capital to a construction project.\n\nThe members to a Joint Venture not taxable as corporation shall each be responsible in reporting and paying appropriate income taxes on their respective share to the joint ventures profit.\"\n\nSuch being the case, the Joint Venture formed by 3K Rock Engineering and DD Likigan Construction for the purpose of undertaking the project: Improvement/Upgrading of Poblacion-Aba-Bacarri Provincial Road, (000+008 to 004+000) is considered a joint venture not taxable as a corporation for having complied with the conditions provided under RR No. 10-2012, i.e., (1) the JV is for the undertaking of construction project; (2) the JV involves joining or pooling of resources by licensed local contractors (licensed as general contractor by the PCAB); (3) the local contractors are engaged in construction business; and (4) the JV itself is duly licensed by PCAB; and therefore not subject to the corporate income tax under Section 27 (A) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended (BIR Ruling Nos. 176-14 dated June 9, 2014 and 0503-2019 dated September 6, 2019).\n\nFurthermore, the gross payments to the joint venture are, likewise, not subject to the 2% creditable withholding tax prescribed under Section 57 (B) of the same Code, as implemented by RR No. 2-98, as amended by RR No. 14-2002. (Section 4 (B) (5) of RR No. 14-2002 dated September 9, 2002) as amended.\n\nThe Provincial Government of Mountain Province being a government entity shall, before making payment on account of each purchase of goods and services which shall be subject to the value-added tax imposed in Sections 106 and 108 of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, deduct and withhold a final value-added tax at the rate of five percent (5%) of the gross payment thereof pursuant to Section 114 (C) of the same Code (BIR Ruling No. 013-2018 dated January 10, 2018).\n\nThe herein Joint Venture being exempt from corporate income tax is not required to file quarterly and final adjustment returns but the co-venturers are separately subject to the regular corporate income tax imposed under Section 27 (A) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, on their taxable income during each taxable year respectively derived by them from the aforesaid construction project (BIR Ruling No. 1243-2018 dated October 12, 2018).\n\nIt should be emphasized that the respective net income of the co-venturers derived from the JV Project is subject to the creditable withholding tax imposed under Section 57 of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, and implemented by RR No. 2-98. as amended. Thus, before the Joint Venture distributes the net income to 3K Rock Engineering and DD Likigan Construction pursuant to their agreed profits/income sharing, it shall withhold the tax based on the net income of its co-venturers. (BIR Ruling No. 0503-2019 dated September 6, 2019)\n\nFinally, 3K Rock Engineering and DD Likigan Construction are required to enroll themselves to the Bureau of Internal Revenue's Electronic Filing and Payment System (EFPS).The enrollment should be done at the Revenue District Office (RDO) where they are registered as taxpayers. (Section 4 of RR No. 10-2012)\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be ascertained that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered as null and void.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R.

Macasaet\nPresident and General Manager\n\nGentlemen :\n\nThis refers to your letter dated February 16, 2021 requesting for a ruling on whether to remit to the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR),the documentary stamp tax (DST) collected on non-life insurance policies issued by the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) to the agencies of the National Government (national agencies) in taxable year 2018.\n\nYour letter mentioned that by virtue of BIR Ruling No. 554-2017 dated December 4, 2017, GSIS decided to refund to the national agencies the DST collected by GSIS on the non-life insurance policies GSIS issued to these national agencies. However, it is claimed that BIR Ruling No. 140-2019 dated January 29, 2019, issued to the Bureau of Treasury (BTr) stating that the parametric insurance it procured from GSIS is subject to DST under Section 184 of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended (Tax Code), has impliedly revoked the earlier BIR Ruling No. 554-2017 issued to GSIS.\n\nThus, GSIS is contemplating to remit to the BIR the DST it collected on the insurance policies issued to the national agencies in 2018, instead of refunding the said DST to the said national agencies, and requests that no surcharge or interest be imposed, as GSIS relied in good faith on BIR Ruling No. 554-2017.\n\nIn reply, we quote the relevant portion of BIR Ruling No. 554-2017 which states that the certificates are exempt from DST, as follows:\n\n\"In reply, please be informed that Section 173 of the Tax Code, as amended, provides that there shall be levied, collected, and paid upon documents, instruments and papers evidencing the act done or transaction had or the agreement or contract has been perfected, DST. On the other hand, Section 184 of the same Code provides that DST shall be based on the amount of premium charged. DST shall be due upon the issuance of the insurance policy and the premium charged on the estimated insurance coverage, as it is reflected on the face of the policy, and which shall be the amount on which the DST due shall be based. aDSIHc\n\nHowever, Section 199 of the Tax Code, as amended, and as implemented by Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 13-04 dated December 23, 2004, provides that that certificates placed upon documents, instruments and papers for the national government, made at the instance and for the sole use of some other branch of the national government, are exempt from documentary stamp tax \u2014\n\n'SEC. 199. Documents and Papers Not Subject to Stamp Tax.\u2014 The provisions of Section 173 to the contrary notwithstanding, the following instruments, documents and papers shall be exempt from the documentary stamp tax:\n\n(a) Policies of insurance or annuities. ..\n\n(b) Certificates of oaths administered to any government official in his official capacity or of acknowledgment by any government official in the performance of his official duties, written appearance in any court by any government official, in his official capacity; certificates of the administration of oaths to any person as to the authenticity of any paper required to be filed in court by any person or party thereto, whether the proceedings be civil or criminal; papers and documents filed in courts by or for the national, provincial, city or municipal governments; affidavits of poor persons for the purpose of proving poverty; statements and other compulsory information required of persons or corporations by the rules and regulations of the national, provincial, city or municipal governments exclusively for statistical purposes and which are wholly for the use of the bureau or office in which they are filed, and not at the instance or for the use or benefit of the person filing them; certified copies and other certificates placed upon documents, instruments and papers for the national, provincial, city, or municipal governments, made at the instance and for the sole use of some other branch of the national, provincial, city or municipal governments;...'\n\nIn view of the foregoing, the certificates of insurance policy that will be issued by GSIS to the Bureau of Internal Revenue, being certificates for an agency under the Executive branch of the national government, made at its instance and for its sole use, and for the account of the Bureau of Internal Revenue are exempt from the DST.\" (Underscoring supplied)\n\nIn short, the DST that BIR Ruling No. 554-2017 was referring to, as the one exempt pursuant to Sec. 199 (b) of the Tax Code, was the DST applicable for certificates or Section 188 of the same Tax Code which states:\n\n\"SEC. 188. Stamp Tax on Certificates.\u2014 On each certificate of damages or otherwise, and on every certificate or document issued by any customs officer, marine surveyor, or other person acting as such, and on each certificate issued by a notary public, and on each certificate of any description required by law or by rules or regulations of a public office, or which is issued for the purpose of giving information, or establishing proof of a fact, and not otherwise specified herein, there shall be collected a documentary stamp tax of Fifteen pesos (P15.00).\" [1]\n\nBIR Ruling No. 554-2017, however, was silent on whether the insurance policy itself, and not just the Certificate of insurance policy that was issued, was subject to DST under Section 184 of the Tax Code.\n\nThis was finally clarified in BIR Ruling No. 140-2019 which stated that:\n\n\"In reply, please be informed that Section 184 of the 1997 Tax Code, as amended, provides:\n\n'SEC. 184. Stamp Tax on Policies of Insurance upon Property.\u2014 On all policies of insurance or other instruments by whatever name the same may be called, by which insurance shall be made or renewed upon property of any description, including rents or profits, against peril by sea or on inland waters, or by fire or lightning, there shall be collected a documentary stamp tax of Fifty centavos (P0.50) on each Four pesos (P4.00),or fractional part thereof, of the amount of premium charged: Provided, however, That no documentary stamp tax shall be collected on reinsurance contracts or on any instrument by which cession or acceptance of insurance risks under any reinsurance agreement is effected or recorded.'\n\nBased on the above-quoted provision, an insurance policy by which insurance is made or renewed upon property is subject to DST on the amount of the premium charged.Hence, the insurance policy to be issued by GSIS in favor of the BTr, in the absence of a law expressly exempting said transaction from DST, is subject to the DST imposed under the above provision.\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\nIt must be emphasized that the exemption from DST found in Section 199 (b) of the 1997 Tax Code, as amended, covers only DST on certified true copies and other certificates placed upon documents, instruments and papers for the national, provincial, city or municipal governments, made at the instance and for the sole use of other branch of government, and does not include DST on insurance policy which is specifically covered by Section 184 of the same Code.\" (Underscoring supplied)\n\nBIR Ruling No. 140-2019 did not revoke BIR Ruling No. 554-2017. They are complementary.\n\nIn summary, a regular insurance policy is subject to DST under Section 184 of the Tax Code which is based on the amount of premium charged. Once such insurance policy is issued, it is also subject to DST on certificates under Section 188 of the same Tax Code. ETHIDa\n\nApplying the above in the instant case, an insurance policy procured by a national agency from GSIS which is a tax-exempt party by virtue of Section 39 of Republic Act No. 8291, [2] once issued, is exempt from the DST on certificates under Section 188 of the Tax Code, pursuant to Section 199 (b) of the Tax Code, but is liable for DST on the amount of premium charged under Section 184 of the Tax Code.\n\nBased on the foregoing, GSIS, relying in good faith on BIR Ruling No. 554-2017 which was silent on the DST on Section 184 of the Tax Code, is immediately enjoined to remit to the BIR the DST it collected on non-life insurance policies it issued to the national agencies in taxable year 2018, without surcharge and interest.\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be disclosed that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void.\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R.

Polished and/or husked rice, corn grits, raw cane sugar and molasses, and ordinary salt shall be considered in their original state.\n\n(B) Sale or importation of fertilizers; seeds, seedlings and fingerlings; fish, prawn, livestock and poultry feeds, including ingredients, whether locally produced or imported, used in the manufacture of finished feeds (except specialty feeds for race horses, fighting cocks, aquarium fish, zoo animals and other animals generally considered as pets);\n\nxxx xxx xxx\"\n\nThe words \"ingredients\" and \"feeds\" are defined in Section 3 of Republic Act (RA) No. 1556 (An Act to Regulate and Control the Manufacture, Importation, Labelling, Advertising, and Sale of Livestock and Poultry Feeds), otherwise known as the \"Livestock and Poultry Feeds Act,\" as amended by Presidential Decree (PD) No. 7, as follows:\n\n\"Section 3.

Racela\nExecutive Director\n\nGentlemen :\n\nThis refers to your letter dated July 13, 2020 requesting confirmation that payments to AAA (the \"Consultant\"),a non-resident, foreign service provider, for services rendered outside the Philippines are not subject to Philippine income tax, and consequently, to the withholding tax and value-added tax (VAT).\n\nBackground\n\n1. The Consultant is a _________ resident, with office address at ______________________________.\n\n2. The Philippines underwent the Third Round Mutual Evaluation (ME) [1] process in 2018 to 2019. Based on the ME results, the Philippines meet the ICRG [2] referral criteria. Jurisdictions who meet the criteria enter a twelve (12)-month observation period. The 12-month observation period, which started in October 2019, is an opportunity for the Philippines to remedy the identified shortcomings in the ME report.\n\n3. On June 10, 2020, the Anti-Money Laundering Council (AMLC) entered into a Consultancy Agreement [3] with the Consultant, wherein it was agreed that the following services are to be provided:\n\n\"1. Nature of Services\n\n1.1. The Consultant shall provide strategic Anti-Money Laundering/Counter-Terrorism Financing (AML/CTF) expertise and technical advice to the AMLC in support of the International Cooperation Review Group (ICRG) process, the Twelve-month Observation Period and overall improvements to the Philippines' AML/CTF system in line with the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Standards.\n\n1.2. Services will be provided both through desk-based review and in-country missions, as broadly agreed by the Parties, and in accordance with the Terms of Reference (TOR) (Annex A),which is made an integral part hereof.\n\n1.3. Conference calls and email communications shall take place to plan, coordinate and discuss the tasks being carried out by the Consultant and the relevant government ministries and agencies of the Philippines and in line with the demand from the project.\"\n\n4. The Consultancy Services Agreement is valid for a period of nine (9) months, starting June 10, 2020 and ends on February 28, 2021, renewable at the option of the AMLC, subject to the execution of another Agreement. The main outputs of the consultant will be the inputs on the reports and documents relative to the ME Post Observation requirements. Guidance and advice can likewise be delivered through emails and conference calls. Workshops are conducted to assist the Philippines in organizing and writing reports. [4]\n\n5. Given the global pandemic, all the services are rendered outside of the Philippines such as the desk-based reviews and the in-country missions/workshops which shall be delivered online or remotely.

Tax on Nonresident Alien Individual.\u2014\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(B) Nonresident Alien Individual Not Engaged in Trade or Business within the Philippines. \u2014 There shall be levied, collected and paid for each taxable year upon the entire income received from all sources within the Philippines by every nonresident alien individual not engaged in trade or business within the Philippines as ...salaries, wages, ...compensation, remuneration, ...a tax equal to twenty-five percent (25%) of such income. ...\"\n\nIn relation to the above provisions, Section 42 (A) (3) and (C) (3) of the Tax Code states that compensation for labor or personal services is derived from sources within the Philippines if the services are performed therein, and outside if the services are performed outside the Philippines, to wit:\n\n\"SEC. 42. Income from Sources within the Philippines.\u2014\n\n(A) Gross Income from Sources within the Philippines. \u2014 The following items of gross income shall be treated as gross income from sources within the Philippines:\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(3) Services. \u2014 Compensation for labor or personal services performed in the Philippines;\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(C) Gross Income from Sources without the Philippines. \u2014 The following items of gross income shall be treated as income from sources without the Philippines:\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(3) Compensation for labor or personal services performed without the Philippines;\"\n\nPursuant to the above provisions, non-resident alien individuals are subject to income tax only on income derived from all sources within the Philippines. Conversely, they are not subject to income tax on income derived from sources outside the Philippines.\n\nThis Office explained in BIR Ruling No. 212-12 dated March 23, 2012:\n\n\"The situs of tax for services is the place where the service is rendered. Under the Philippine source of income rules for income tax purposes, service income will be considered Philippine source income only if the services are rendered in the Philippines. Conversely, if the services are rendered outside the Philippines, the service income will be considered as foreign source income. x x x\n\n\"The rule in this jurisdiction regarding tax situs is: the source of an income is the property, activity or service that produced the income; the test of taxability is the source, and the source of an income is that activity which produced the income (CIR v. British Overseas Airways Corporation, G.R. Nos. 65773-74, April 30, 1987).Stated differently, the situs of the income derived from labor or personal services is determined solely by the place where service is rendered (CIR v. Japan Airlines, Inc.,G.R. No. 60714, March 6, 1991).Compensation from services performed abroad is, therefore, considered income from sources without the Philippines and thus not subject to Philippine income tax.\" (Emphasis supplied.)\n\nApplying the foregoing provisions, since AAA is a non-resident alien individual not doing business in the Philippines and her professional fees or compensation constitute income derived from sources outside the Philippines, it can be said that the same are not subject to income tax, and consequently, to the withholding tax.\n\nOn the other hand, Section 108 (A) of the Tax Code clearly reads that the sale or exchange of services subject to VAT include only those services that are performed in the Philippines, viz.:\n\n\"SEC. 108. Value-Added Tax on Sale of Services and Use or Lease of Properties.\u2014\n\n(A) Rate and Base of Tax.\u2014 There shall be levied, assessed and collected, a value-added tax equivalent to twelve percent (12%) of gross receipts derived from the sale or exchange of services, including the use or lease of properties.\n\nThe phrase 'sale or exchange of services' means the performance of all kinds of services in the Philippines for others for a fee, remuneration of consideration. ..\"\n\nAccordingly, the service fees to be paid by AMLC to AAA,to the extent that the subject services are not performed in the Philippines, are exempt from VAT. AScHCD\n\nIN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, this Office hereby CONFIRMS your opinion that the income payments made for services rendered abroad or outside the Philippines by AAA to AMLC are NOT subject to Philippine income tax, withholding tax, and VAT.\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be disclosed that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R.

(DLAI) for reconsideration of BIR Ruling No. 727-2019 dated December 5, 2019 denying its request for renewal of its tax exemption.\n\nThe pertinent portion of the aforesaid Ruling provides:\n\n\"The payment of salaries and other incentives to members of the Board of Trustees is considered a distribution of the equity (including the net income) of DIVINE LIGHT ACADEMY, INC. This is a form of private inurement which the law prohibits in the organization and operation of a non-stock, non-profit corporation. This act is not in accordance with the definition of 'non-profit' that 'no net income or asset accrues to or benefits any member or specific person, with all the net income or assets devoted to the institution's purposes and all its activities conducted not for profit.' Thus, DIVINE LIGHT ACADEMY, INC. cannot be qualified as a non-profit educational institution under Section 30 (H) of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended.\"\n\nIt is argued that there was no misrepresentation in the sworn certification issued by the treasurer of DLAI that its trustees do not receive any amount of income, compensation, salaries, per diem or any emoluments from the school since the Alpha List for the year 2013 shows that BBB, CCC, and DDD received compensation income as officers of the company and not by reason of their being members of the board of trustees. While it is true that the aforesaid Trustees are receiving compensations or emoluments, they do so not as Trustees of DLAI but as officers of the corporation.\n\nIn reply, please be informed that the Supreme Court, in the case of Western Institute of Technology, Inc., et al. vs. Ricardo T. Salas, et al.,G.R. No. 113032, August 21, 1997, held:\n\n\"The pertinent section of the Corporation Code provides:\n\nSec. 30. Compensation of directors. \u2014 In the absence of any provision in the by-laws fixing their compensation, the directors shall not receive any compensation, as such directors except for reasonable per diems: Provided however, That any such compensation (other than per diems) may be granted to directors by the vote of the stockholders representing at least a majority of the outstanding capital stock at a regular or special stockholders' meeting. In no case shall the total yearly compensation of directors, as such directors, exceed ten (10%) percent of the net income before income tax of the corporation during the preceding year. ICHDca\n\nThere is no argument that directors or trustees, as the case may be, are not entitled to salary or other compensation when they perform nothing more than the usual and ordinary duties of their office. This rule is founded upon the presumption that directors/trustees render service gratuitously, and that the return upon their shares adequately furnishes the motives for service, without compensation. Under the foregoing section, there are only two (2) ways by which members of the board can be granted compensation apart from reasonable per diems: (1) when there is a provision in the by-laws fixing their compensation;and (2) when the stockholders representing a majority of the outstanding capital stock at a regular or special stockholders' meeting agree to give it to them.\n\nThis proscription, however, against granting compensation to directors/trustees of a corporation is not a sweeping rule. Worthy of note is the clear phraseology of Section 30 which states: '...[T]he directors shall not receive any compensation, as such directors, ....' The phrase 'as such directors' is not without significance for it delimits the scope of the prohibition to compensation given to them for services performed purely in their capacity as directors or trustees. The unambiguous implication is that members of the board may receive compensation, in addition to reasonable per diems, when they render services to the corporation in a capacity other than as directors/trustees.\" (Emphasis provided)\n\nThe High Court in the above decision categorically ruled that corporate officers who are at the same time directors or trustees of the corporation are entitled to additional compensation other than reasonable per diems. [1]\n\nWe note that in a resolution of the Board of Trustees dated December 7, 2013, it was adopted and approved that the Chairman, President, Vice-President, Treasurer, and Secretary shall be compensated or remunerated fairly, reasonably, and equitably. For such purpose, it was resolved that an Ad Hoc Compensation Committee be designated to formulate the reasonable compensation for each of the above corporate positions. BBB, CCC, and DDD (former Trustee) were duly elected officers of DLAI who were receiving their compensations as such officers of the corporation. [2]\n\nSections 1 to 5 of Article IV of the By-laws enumerate the corresponding duties of the abovementioned officers. Clearly, BBB, CCC, and DDD received compensation not in their capacity as members of the board, but rather as officers of the corporation as authorized by the corporation's By-laws.\n\nSuch being the case, your request for reconsideration of the ruling denying DLAI's request for renewal of its tax exemption is GRANTED and BIR Ruling No. 727-2019 is hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE.\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be ascertained that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void. TCAScE\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R.

[1] All income not expressly excluded or exempted from the class of taxable income, irrespective of the voluntary action of the taxpayer in producing the income, and regardless of the source of income, is taxable. [2] Likewise, any economic benefit to the employee that increases his net worth; whatever may have been the mode by which it is effected, is taxable. [3]\n\nIt is very clear that the basis of considering backwages within the ambit of gross taxable income is the broad scope of its definition. Unless a statute provides otherwise, the inclusion thereof is inevitable.\n\nThe reliance on the case entitled American Power Conversion Corporation, et al. vs. Jayson Lim [4] is misplaced. In said case, the Supreme Court, pro hac vice, granted the claim of the respondent for backwages despite the bizarre circumstances surrounding the case. However, there was nothing in the said case that categorically justifies the exclusion of backwages from the scope of gross taxable income.\n\nPlease take note that \"[a] tax exemption represents a loss of revenue to the State and must therefore not be lightly granted or inferred. When claimed, it must be strictly construed against the taxpayer, who must prove that he comes under the exemption rather than the rule that everyone must contribute his just share in the maintenance of the government.\" [5] \"He who claims tax exemptions must be able to justify his claim or right.\" [6]\n\nIn establishing tax exemptions, it should be borne in mind that taxation is the rule, exemption is the exception. Accordingly, statutes granting tax exemptions must be construed in strictissimi juris against the taxpayer and liberally in favor of the taxing authority. One who claims an exemption from tax payments rests the burden of justifying the exemption by words too plain to be mistaken and too categorical to be misinterpreted. [7] It cannot be over-emphasized that tax exemption represents a loss of revenue to the government and must, therefore, not rest on vague inference. Exemption from taxation is never presumed. For tax exemption to be recognized the grant must be clear and express; it cannot be made to rest on doubtful implications. [8]\n\nIn view of the foregoing, this Office hereby rules to deny your request for reconsideration. Consider this as our final resolution on the matter.\n\nPlease be guided accordingly.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R. DULAY\nCommissioner of Internal Revenue\n\n1.

                                    "Details": "Section 32 (A) and 32 (B) (6), Tax Code, as amended;\nRMC No. 39-2012; BIR Ruling No. OT-700-2020\n\nAAA\n____________________\n\nSir :\n\nThis refers to your letter dated January 29, 2021 seeking reconsideration of BIR Ruling No. OT-700-2020 dated December 29, 2020, denying your previous request for a policy ruling that categorically exclude backwages awarded from a judgement of illegal dismissal from the ambit of gross taxable income.\n\nIn reply, please be informed that the National Internal Revenue Code (Tax Code) of 1997, as amended, defined gross income as all income derived from whatever source. [1] All income not expressly excluded or exempted from the class of taxable income, irrespective of the voluntary action of the taxpayer in producing the income, and regardless of the source of income, is taxable. [2] Likewise, any economic benefit to the employee that increases his net worth; whatever may have been the mode by which it is effected, is taxable. [3]\n\nIt is very clear that the basis of considering backwages within the ambit of gross taxable income is the broad scope of its definition. Unless a statute provides otherwise, the inclusion thereof is inevitable.\n\nThe reliance on the case entitled American Power Conversion Corporation, et al. vs. Jayson Lim [4] is misplaced. In said case, the Supreme Court, pro hac vice, granted the claim of the respondent for backwages despite the bizarre circumstances surrounding the case. However, there was nothing in the said case that categorically justifies the exclusion of backwages from the scope of gross taxable income.\n\nPlease take note that \"[a] tax exemption represents a loss of revenue to the State and must therefore not be lightly granted or inferred. When claimed, it must be strictly construed against the taxpayer, who must prove that he comes under the exemption rather than the rule that everyone must contribute his just share in the maintenance of the government.\" [5] \"He who claims tax exemptions must be able to justify his claim or right.\" [6]\n\nIn establishing tax exemptions, it should be borne in mind that taxation is the rule, exemption is the exception. Accordingly, statutes granting tax exemptions must be construed in strictissimi juris against the taxpayer and liberally in favor of the taxing authority. One who claims an exemption from tax payments rests the burden of justifying the exemption by words too plain to be mistaken and too categorical to be misinterpreted. [7] It cannot be over-emphasized that tax exemption represents a loss of revenue to the government and must, therefore, not rest on vague inference. Exemption from taxation is never presumed. For tax exemption to be recognized the grant must be clear and express; it cannot be made to rest on doubtful implications. [8]\n\nIn view of the foregoing, this Office hereby rules to deny your request for reconsideration. Consider this as our final resolution on the matter.\n\nPlease be guided accordingly.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R. DULAY\nCommissioner of Internal Revenue\n\n1.

(\"the Company\") from First-In, First-Out (FIFO) method to Moving Average method effective January 1, 2019.\n\nAs represented, DAMOSA LAND, INC., with Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) 000-000-000-00000, is a corporation duly organized and existing under Philippine laws, with office address at Damosa Corporate Center, Lanang, Davao City 8000. It is primarily engaged in the business of acquiring by purchase, lease, donation or otherwise, and owning, using, improving, developing, subdividing, selling, mortgaging, exchanging, leasing and holding for investment or otherwise, real estate of all kinds, whether improve, manage or otherwise dispose of buildings, houses, apartments and other structures of whatever kind, together with their appurtenances.\n\nFrom the time of its incorporation, the company has consistently adopted the FIFO method in costing its raw materials. In order to facilitate its cost accounting and optimize the use of its computerized system, the Company will install computerized cost accounting system. The computerized accounting system to be adopted is Systems Applications and Products (SAP) Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Software which recognizes the Moving Average method for raw materials.\n\nThe Bureau of Internal Revenue issued a Permit to Use (PTU) Computerized Accounting System in favor of the Company on December 28, 2018. The PTU is valid from January 7, 2019 to January 6, 2024.\n\nConsequently, per Corporate Secretary's Certificate, the Board of Directors approved and authorized the Company to change its inventory costing method for raw materials from FIFO costing method under Microsoft GP ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) Software to Moving Average costing method under SAP (Systems Applications and Products) ERP Software: HESIcT\n\nFrom\n\nTo\n\nRaw Materials\n\nFIFO\n\nMoving Average\n\nIn reply, please be informed that Section 41 of the Tax Code, as amended, provides:\n\n\"Section 41. Inventories. \u2014 Whenever in the judgment of the Commissioner, the use of inventories is necessary in order to determine clearly the income of any taxpayer, inventories shall be taken by such taxpayer upon such basis as the Secretary of Finance, upon the recommendation of the Commissioner, may, by rules and regulations, prescribe as conforming as nearly as may be to the best accounting practice in the trade or business and as most clearly reflecting the income.\n\nIf a taxpayer, after having complied with the terms and conditions prescribed by the Commissioner, uses a particular method of valuing its inventory for any taxable year, then such method shall be used in all subsequent taxable years unless:\n\n(i) with the approval of the Commissioner, a change to a different method is authorized; or AcICHD\n\n(ii) the Commissioner finds that the nature of the stock on hand (e.g., its scarcity, liquidity, marketability and price movements) is such that inventory gains should be considered realized for tax purposes and, therefore, it is necessary to modify the valuation method for purposes of ascertaining the income, profits, or loss in a more realistic manner: Provided, however, That the Commissioner shall not exercise its authority to require a change in inventory method more often than once every three (3) years: Provided, further, That any change in an inventory valuation method must be subject to approval by the Secretary of Finance.\" (Emphasis provided.)\n\nIn relation to the above Section of the Tax Code, as amended, Section 145 of Revenue Regulations No. 2 states:\n\n\"Section 145. Valuation of Inventories. \u2014 The law provides two tests to which each inventory must conform. \u2014 (1) it must conform as nearly as possible to the best accounting practice in the trade or business, and (2) it must clearly reflect the income. It follows, therefore, that inventory rules can not be uniform but must give effect to trade customs which come within the scope of the best accounting practice in the particular trade or business. In order to clearly reflect income, the inventory practice of a taxpayer should be consistent from year to year, and greater weight is to be given to consistency than to any particular method of inventory or basis of valuation, as long as the method or basis used is substantially in accord with these regulations, an inventory that can be used under the best accounting practice in a balance sheet showing the financial position of the taxpayer is, as a general rule, regarded as clearly reflecting his income.\"\n\nSince the change in the Company's accounting method will best conform to the accounting practice applicable in the trade or business of the Company and that said valuation will clearly reflect its income and financial position, DAMOSA LAND, INC. is hereby granted permission to change its accounting method from FIFO method to Moving Average method in valuing its raw materials pursuant to the provision of Section 41 of the Tax Code, as amended, effective January 1, 2019.\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be ascertained that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R.

[1]\n\nIn reply, please be informed that Section 3 of Republic Act (RA) No. 8367 otherwise known as \"An Act Providing for the Regulation of the Organization and Operation of Non-Stock Savings and Loan Associations\" defines non-stock savings and loan associations (NSSLAs) as \"a non-stock, non-profit corporation engaged in the business of accumulating the savings of its members and using such accumulations for loans to members to service the needs of households by providing long term financing for home building and development and for personal finance.\" Section 4 thereof provides that NSSLA shall confine its membership to a well-defined group of person and shall not transact business with the general public.\n\nSection 4101S.1 of BSP Manual of Regulation for NSSLA enumerates membership for NSSLAs as a well-defined group which consist of employees, officers, and directors of one company, including member-retirees; government employees belonging to the same department, branch, office; including member-retirees; and; immediate members of the families of the abovementioned, up to the second degree of consanguinity or affinity. Likewise, Section 4101S of the BSP Manual requires that a NSSLA shall accept deposit from and grant loans to its members only and shall not transact business with the general public. SDAaTC\n\nR.A. No. 8367 also provides tax exemption to NSSLAs as provided under Section 5, to wit:\n\n\"SECTION 5. TAX EXEMPTION. \u2014 An Association shall be exempt from payment of tax in respect to income it receives, including interest on its deposits with any bank: Provided, however, that income derived from any of its properties, real or personal, or any activity conducted for profit, regardless of the disposition thereof, is subject to the corresponding internal revenue taxes imposed under the National Internal Revenue Code. Interest earnings on deposits of members with Associations as well as the shares of its members from the net income of the Associations shall be exempt from income tax.\"\n\nAccordingly, Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) Revenue Memorandum Circular (RMC) No. 9-2016 was issued to clarify the taxability of NSSLAs for purposes of income tax, gross receipts tax and documentary stamp tax. The said RMC provides that NSSLAs are under the direct supervision and regulation of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) and, for regulatory purposes, they are classified as Non-Bank Financial Intermediaries (NBFIs) under the BSP Manual of Regulations. Hence, NSSLA is generally subject to GRT on income derived from its operations, unless otherwise exempted under special rules. The GRT imposed is under Section 122 of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) of 1997, as amended, i.e.,tax on other NBFIs.\n\nRelative thereto, Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 9-2004, entitled \"Implementing Certain Provisions of Republic Act No. 9238, Re-Imposing the Gross Receipts Tax (GRT) on Banks and Non-Bank Financial Intermediaries Performing Quasi-Banking Functions and Other Non-Bank Financial Intermediaries Beginning January 1, 2004\" defines NBFIs as follows:\n\n\"2.3. Non-bank Financial Intermediaries \u2014 shall refer to persons or entities whose principal functions include the lending, investing or placement of funds or evidences of indebtedness or equity deposited with them, acquired by them or otherwise coursed through them either for their own account or for the account of others. This includes all entities regularly engaged in the lending of funds or purchasing of receivables or other obligations with funds obtained from the public through the issuance, endorsement or acceptance of debt instruments of any kind for their own account, or through the issuance of certificates of assignment or similar instruments with recourse, trust certificates, or of repurchase agreements, whether any of these means of obtaining funds from the public is done on a regular basis or only occasionally.\"\n\nFurther, in the case of City of Davao and Bella Linda N. Tanjili vs. Randy Allied Ventures, Inc.,G.R. No. 241697, July 29, 2019, the Supreme Court held that:\n\n\"In order to be considered as an NBFI under the National Internal Revenue Code, banking laws, and pertinent regulations, the following must concur:\n\na. The person or entity is authorized by the BSP to perform quasi-banking functions;\n\nb. The principal functions of said person or entity include the lending, investing or placement of funds or evidences of indebtedness or equity deposited to them, acquired by them, or otherwise coursed through them, either for their own account or for the account of others; and\n\nc. The person or entity must perform any of the following functions on a regular and recurring, not on an isolated basis, to wit:\n\n1. Receive funds from one (1) group of persons, irrespective of number, through traditional deposits, or issuance of debt or equity securities; and make available/lend these fund to another person or entity, and in the process acquire debt or equity securities;\n\n2. Use principally the funds received for acquiring various types of debt or equity securities;\n\n3. Borrow against, or lend on, or buy or sell debt or equity securities.\"\n\nClearly, the imposition of GRT is on NBFIs engaged in the lending of funds or purchasing of receivables or obligations with funds obtained from the public. On the other hand, RA No. 8367 and the BSP Manual of Regulations for NSSLA mandate that a NSSLA shall accept deposit from and grant loans to its members only and shall not transact business with the general public. Not only that, NSSLAs must be organized and operated exclusively for the mutual benefit of its members. RA No. 8367 requires that all funds received from members are accumulated to be utilized for the common benefit of the members by providing long term financing for home building and development and for personal finance. acEHCD\n\nBased thereon, since FABSLAI showed that it is a NSSLA, a non-profit organization, which obtains funds exclusively from its members and does not transact business with the general public, it is our considered view that GRT imposed under RMC No. 9-2016 on its lending activities is not warranted for as long as such transactions do not fall under the contemplated activities of a NBFI as defined by law and its rules and regulations.\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be disclosed that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R. DULAY\nCommissioner of Internal Revenue\n\n1.Amended Articles of Incorporation of the Armed Forces and Police Savings & Loan Association, Inc.",

Floirendo, Panabo City\n\nAttention: AAA\n_______________\n\nGentlemen :\n\nThis refers to your letter dated October 4, 2019 requesting for authority, pursuant to Section 41 of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended (Tax Code), to change the accounting method on inventory costing of DAVAO PACKAGING CORPORATION (\"the Company\") from First-In, First-Out (FIFO) method to Moving Average method for raw materials inventory, and from Average Production Cost method to Standard Price method for work-in-process inventory and finished goods inventory effective January 1, 2019.\n\nAs represented, DAVAO PACKAGING CORPORATION (TIN: 000-000-000-000) is a corporation duly organized and existing under Philippine laws, with office address at Purok 9, Block 1, A.O. Floirendo, Panabo City.\n\nThe Company is engaged in the business of manufacturing, producing and processing paper and pulp, cartons, corrugated cardboard, plastic products, boxes, paper or cardboard containers, packaging materials and other allied or similar products for sale, whether in domestic or foreign markets and, for this purpose, sell, purchase, import, export, trade in, barter, or deal with, such materials, paper, pulp, machineries, equipment and tools necessary to effect the same.\n\nThe Large Taxpayers Service of the BIR issued a Permit to Use (PTU) Computerized Accounting System in favor of the Company on November 26, 2018. The PTU is valid from December 3, 2018 to December 2, 2023.\n\nConsequently, per Corporate Secretary's Certificate dated 5 August 2019, the Board of Directors approved and authorized the Company to change its inventory costing method for the following items from their respective previous costing methods under Microsoft GP ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) Software to its new costing methods under SAP (Systems Applications and Products) ERP Software:\n\nFrom\n\nTo\n\nRaw Materials\n\nFIFO\n\nMoving Average\n\nWork in Process\n\nAverage Production Cost\n\nStandard Price\n\nFinished Goods\n\nAverage Production Cost\n\nStandard Price\n\nFrom the time of its incorporation, the company has consistently adopted the FIFO method in costing its raw materials, and Average Production cost method in costing its work in process and finished goods. In order to facilitate its cost accounting and optimize the use of its computerized system, the Company will install computerized cost accounting system. The computerized accounting system to be adopted is Systems Applications and Products (SAP) Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Software which recognizes the (1) Moving Average method for raw materials and the (2) Standard Price method for work in process and finished goods. Correspondingly, the Moving Average method for valuing its raw materials and Standard Price method for work in process and finished goods will be a more effective costing method for all the respective inventories and will best conform to its accounting practice as said valuation will clearly reflect the income of the Company. AIDSTE\n\nIn reply, please be informed that Section 41 of the Tax Code provides:\n\n\"Section 47. Inventories. \u2014 Whenever in the judgment of the Commissioner, the use of inventories is necessary in order to determine clearly the income of any taxpayer, inventories shall be taken by such taxpayer upon such basis as the Secretary of Finance, upon the recommendation of the Commissioner, may, by rules and regulations, prescribe as conforming as nearly as may be to the best accounting practice in the trade or business and as most clearly reflecting the income.\n\nIf a taxpayer, after having complied with the terms and conditions prescribed by the Commissioner, uses a particular method of valuing its inventory for any taxable year, then such method shall be used in all subsequent taxable years unless:\n\n(i) with the approval of the Commissioner, a change to a different method is authorized;or\n\n(ii) the Commissioner finds that the nature of the stock on hand (e.g.,its scarcity, liquidity, marketability and price movements) is such that inventory gains should be considered realized for tax purposes and, therefore, it is necessary to modify the valuation method for purposes of ascertaining the income, profits, or loss in a more realistic manner: Provided, however, That the Commissioner shall not exercise its authority to require a change in inventory method more often than once every three (3) years: Provided, further, That any change in an inventory valuation method must be subject to approval by the Secretary of Finance.\" (Emphasis provided.)\n\nIn relation to the above section of the Tax Code, Section 145 of Revenue Regulations No. 2 states:\n\n\"Section 145. Valuation of Inventories. \u2014 The law provides two tests to which each inventory must conform. \u2014 (1) it must conform as nearly as possible to the best accounting practice in the trade or business, and (2) it must clearly reflect the income. It follows, therefore, that inventory rules can not be uniform but must give effect to trade customs which come within the scope of the best accounting practice in the particular trade or business. In order to clearly reflect income, the inventory practice of a taxpayer should be consistent from year to year, and greater weight is to be given to consistency than to any particular method of inventory or basis of valuation, as long as the method or basis used is substantially in accord with these regulations, an inventory that can be used under the best accounting practice in a balance sheet showing the financial position of the taxpayer is, as a general rule, regarded as clearly reflecting his income.\"\n\nConsidering that the change in the Company's accounting method will best conform to the accounting practice applicable in the trade or business of the Company and the new method of inventory valuation will clearly reflect the income and financial position of the Company, at any given time, DAVAO PACKAGING CORPORATION is hereby granted permission to change its accounting method from FIFO method to Moving Average method for raw materials inventory, and from Average Production Cost to Standard Price method for work in process inventory and finished goods inventory pursuant to the provision of Section 41 of the Tax Code.\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be ascertained that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void. AaCTcI\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R.

You were employed by the Land Bank of the Philippines (\"LBP\" or the \"Bank\") for twenty-five (25) years [1] until your retirement on April 1, 2019 at the age of sixty (60) years old. [2] The last position you held was Department Manager assigned in Pasay (Masagana) Branch.\n\n2. You were in the government service for twenty-eight (28) years until you availed of LBP's SIP pursuant to Landbank Executive Order No. 119, Series of 2016.\n\n3. The SIP allows LBP to enhance personnel demographics and improve overall work productivity and provide flexibility to retain key personnel and infuse fresh and critical talents by way of incentivizing the involuntary separation of employees with medical conditions and/or who are at least fifty-five (55) years of age and have been in the government service for at least twenty-five (25) years and with twenty (20) years of service with the Bank.\n\n4. However, at the time of your retirement on April 1, 2019, you were already qualified to avail of the early retirement under Republic Act (RA) No. 8291.\n\n5. Your application for retirement under RA No. 8291, effective on April 1, 2019 at age sixty (60) years, was approved by the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS). [3]\n\nIn reply, please be informed as follows:\n\nSeparation under the SIP\n\nSection 32 (B) (6) (b) of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997 (Tax Code), as amended, provides that any amount received by an official or employee or by his heirs from the employer as a consequence of separation of such official or employee from the service of the employer due to death, sickness or other physical disability or for any cause beyond the control of the said official or employee is exempt from taxes regardless of age or length of service. The phrase \"for any cause beyond the control of the said official or employee\" in effect connotes involuntariness on the part of the official or employee. The separation from the service of the official or employee must not be of his own making. [4]\n\nThus, the separation of the LBP officials and employees identified and recommended by LBP to have met the criteria for SIP is involuntary based on medical grounds, and is a consequence of the Bank's continuing efforts to rationalize its organizational structure. Therefore, any and all amounts to be received by them as a consequence of their involuntary separation from the service of LBP is not subject to income tax imposed under Section 24 (A) of the Tax Code, as amended, and consequently to the withholding tax on wages pursuant to Section 79 of the same Code.\n\nSeparation under RA No. 8291\n\nSection 32 (B) (6) (f) of the Tax Code, as amended, provides that benefits received from the GSIS under RA No. 8291, including retirement gratuity received by government officials and employees shall not be included in their gross income and shall be exempt from income tax. Under RA No. 8291 otherwise known as the \"Government Insurance System Act of 1997,\" a member who retires from the government service after rendering at least fifteen (15) years of service and is at least sixty (60) years of age upon retirement, shall be entitled to the retirement benefits provided therein. [5] Furthermore, Section 39 of RA No. 8291 provides that the benefits paid by the GSIS shall be exempt from all taxes. AcICHD\n\nYour application for retirement under the SIP has become irrelevant in view of your application for retirement under RA No. 8291. Considering that your application for retirement under RA No. 8291 was approved by the GSIS, the retirement benefits you received from the GSIS under RA No. 8291, after retiring from the service at age sixty (60) years old and after having rendered twenty-five (25) years of service in the LBP, shall be excluded from gross income and shall be exempt from income tax. Moreover, the terminal leave pay, i.e.,the monetization of the unused vacation and sick leaves, shall also be exempt from income tax.\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be ascertained that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R.

Meralco Ave.\nOrtigas Center, Pasig City\n\nAttention: AAA\n_______________\n\nGentlemen :\n\nThis refers to your letter dated January 7, 2020, requesting on behalf of your client, Tas Plan, Inc. (Tas Plan), for confirmation that its sales of services to the Head Office of Taisei Corporation (Taisei), are subject to zero percent (0%) value-added tax (VAT) pursuant to Section 108 (B) (2) of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) of 1997, as amended.\n\nIt is represented that Taisei is a foreign corporation organized and existing under the laws of Japan. It is engaged in construction business on projects outside of the Philippines. On May 11, 1994, Taisei was allowed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to establish a Representative Office in the Philippines under SEC Registration No. AF094-000030. Said Representative Office sought to conduct surveys and feasibility studies of possible project that may be undertaken by the head office in the Philippines; negotiate and finalize documentation of papers relative to head office project; and participate in international bidding for the head office.\n\nOn January 5, 1998, Taisei branched out in the Philippines under SEC Registration No. A199723628. Said Branch Office was formed to engage in and undertake, either alone or jointly with others, the construction, operation, and/or maintenance of infrastructure, irrigation, power, tourism, and other projects under any of the schemes allowed under the Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) law, as well as foreign funded projects covered by bilateral agreements between the government of the Philippines and foreign governments/financial institutions and generally to perform any and all acts connected with the business aforementioned or arising therefrom or incidental thereto as may be allowed by law, rules and regulations.\n\nOn August 10, 2004, Taisei's Certificate of Withdrawal of its license (SEC Registration No. AF094-000030) of a foreign corporation to transact business in the Philippines was issued by SEC.\n\nOn the other hand, Tas Plan (TIN: 000-000-000-000) is a corporation duly organized and existing under Philippine laws engaged in providing specialty, technical and consultation services to foreign or domestic projects. It is 99.9976% owned by Taisei. HEITAD\n\nTas Plan provides design and shop drawings, and estimation work for Taisei Head Office. These services are performed in the Philippines by Tas Plan and are delivered to Taisei in Japan. Taisei pays Tas Plan in Japanese yen which is inwardly remitted from Japan to Tas Plan's Mizuho Bank account in Makati City. These designs and shop drawings, and estimation work that Taisei buys from Tas Plan are used by the former for its construction projects outside of the Philippines.\n\nIn reply, please be informed that Section 108 (B) (2) of the NIRC of 1997, as amended provides that:\n\n\"Section 108. Value-Added Tax on Sale of Services and Use or Lease of Properties.\u2014\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(B) Transactions Subject to Zero Percent (0%) Rate. \u2014 The following services performed in the Philippines by VAT-registered persons shall be subject to zero percent (0%) rate:\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(2) Services other than those mentioned in the preceding paragraph rendered to a person engaged in business conducted outside the Philippines or to a nonresident person not engaged in business who is outside the Philippines when the services are performed,the consideration for which is paid for in acceptable foreign currency and accounted for in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP);\" (Emphasis supplied)\n\nIn Sitel Philippines Corporation v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue,[1] the Supreme Court, citing Burmeister case, clarified the essential condition to qualify for zero-rating under the above-cited provision, to wit:\n\n\"In Burmeister, the Court clarified that an essential condition to qualify for zero-rating under the aforequoted provision is that the service-recipient must be doing business outside the Philippines, to wit:\n\nThe Tax Code not only requires that the services be other than \"processing, manufacturing or repacking of goods\" and that payment for such services be in acceptable foreign currency accounted for in accordance with BSP rules. Another essential condition for qualification to zero-rating under Section 102(b)(2) is that the recipient of such services is doing business outside the Philippines.x x x\n\nThis can only be the logical interpretation of Section 102(b)(2). If the provider and recipient of the \"other services\" are both doing business in the Philippines, the payment of foreign currency is irrelevant. Otherwise, those subject to the regular VAT under Section 102(a) can avoid paying the VAT by simply stipulating payment in foreign currency inwardly remitted by the recipient of services. To interpret Section 102(b)(2) to apply to a payer-recipient of services doing business in the Philippines is to make the payment of the regular VAT under Section 102(a) dependent on the generosity of the taxpayer. The provider of services can choose to pay the regular VAT or avoid it by stipulating payment in foreign currency inwardly remitted by the payer-recipient. Such interpretation removes Section 102(a) as a tax measure in the Tax Code, an interpretation this Court cannot sanction. A tax is a mandatory exaction, not a voluntary contribution.\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\nThus, when Section 102(b)(2) speaks of \"[s]ervices other than those mentioned in the preceding subparagraph,\" the legislative intent is that only the services are different between subparagraphs 1 and 2. The requirements for zero-rating, including the essential condition that the recipient of services is doing business outside the Philippines, remain the same under both subparagraphs.\n\nSignificantly, the amended Section 108(b) [previously Section 102 (b)] of the present Tax Code clarifies this legislative intent. Expressly included among the transactions subject to 0% VAT are \"[s]ervices other than those mentioned in the [first] paragraph [of Section 108(b)] rendered to a person engaged in business conducted outside the Philippines or to a nonresident person not engaged in business who is outside the Philippines when the services are performed, the consideration for which is paid for in acceptable foreign currency and accounted for in accordance with the rules and regulations of the BSP.\"\n\nCorollary, in the case of Accenture, Inc. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue,[2] the Supreme Court emphasized that the taxpayer has the burden to prove not only that the recipient of the service is a foreign corporation but also that said corporation is doing business outside the Philippines: ATICcS\n\n\"Consequently, to come within the purview of Section 108(B)(2),it is not enough that the recipient of the service be proven to be a foreign corporation; rather, it must be specifically proven to be a nonresident foreign corporation.\n\nThere is no specific criterion as to what constitutes \"doing\" or \"engaging in\" or \"transacting\" business. We ruled thus in Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. British Overseas Airways Corporation.\n\nThere is no specific criterion as to what constitutes \"doing\" or \"engaging in\" or \"transacting\" business. Each case must be judged in the light of its peculiar environmental circumstances. The term implies a continuity of commercial dealings and arrangements, and contemplates, to that extent, the performance of acts or works or the exercise of some of the functions normally incident to, and in progressive prosecution of commercial gain or for the purpose and object of the business organization. \"In order that a foreign corporation may be regarded as doing business within a State, there must be continuity of conduct and intention to establish a continuous business, such as the appointment of a local agent, and not one of a temporary character.\"\n\nIt is worth noting that Republic Act (RA) No. 7042 or the Foreign Investments Act of 1991 provides the definition of \"doing business\" relative to foreign corporations:\n\nSEC. 3. Definitions. \u2014 As used in this Act:\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\nd) the phrase \"doing business\" shall include soliciting orders, service contracts, opening offices, whether called \"liaison\" offices or branches; appointing representatives or distributors domiciled in the Philippines or who in any calendar year stay in the country for a period or periods totaling one hundred eighty (180) days or more; participating in the management, supervision or control of any domestic business, firm, entity or corporation in the Philippines; and any other act or acts that imply a continuity of commercial dealings or arrangements, and contemplate to that extent the performance of acts or works, or the exercise of some of the functions normally incident to, and in progressive prosecution of, commercial gain or of the purpose and object of the business organization: Provided, however, That the phrase \"doing business\" shall not be deemed to include mere investment as a shareholder by a foreign entity in domestic corporations duly registered to do business, and/or the exercise of rights as such investor; nor having a nominee director or officer to represent its interests in such corporation; nor appointing a representative or distributor domiciled in the Philippines which transacts business in its own name and for its own account.\n\nSection 3 (d) of RA No. 7042 states that \"opening offices, whether called \"liaison\" offices or branches is considered as \"doing business.\" Also, the Implementing Rules and Regulations of RA No. 7042 qualifies that a \"branch\" office of a foreign company carries out the business activities of the head office and derives income from the host country.\n\nBased on the foregoing, it is deemed certain that this Office cannot sustain the position of Tas Plan because the factual antecedents surrounding their transaction runs contrary to the qualifications set forth by the above-cited jurisprudence. The mere existence of a branch of a foreign corporation negates the application of Section 108 (B) (2) of the NIRC of 1997. Hence, its transactions with Taisei Corporation cannot be treated as subject to zero percent (0%) VAT. TIADCc\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be disclosed that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R.

(the \"Company\") for ruling or approval to change its accounting method on inventory costing from Weighted Average Method to Standard Costing Method for its merchandise inventory starting August 01, 2019.\n\nAs represented, ALCON LABORATORIES (PHILIPPINES),INC.,with Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) ____________ is a corporation duly organized and existing under and by virtue of Philippine laws with office address at 801 8F, Tower 1, Rockwell, Business Center, Blk. 4, MERALCO Compound, Ortigas Avenue, Pasig City. It was registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on February 20, 1970, with SEC Certificate of Registration No. ________.\n\nThe Company was established \"to engage in manufacturing, marketing, selling and distributing drugs, medicines, chemical compounds, insecticides, chemical, medicinal and pharmaceutical preparations, compounds, food and food supplements, and materials of every kind and description, and all articles and products related thereto among others.\"\n\nThe Company has implemented a new Computerized Accounting System known as SAP ERP 6.0, upon which the current method of costing Merchandise Inventory, the Weighted Average Method, is no longer supported and instead uses the Standard Costing Method.\n\nMoreover, the Company has likewise been reorganized as a result of the global restructuring of its parent company, its subsidiaries and affiliates and as such, there is a need to align the Company's inventory costing method with its global organization.\n\nIn reply, please be informed that Section 41 of the National Internal Revenue Code (Tax Code) of 1997, as amended, provides:\n\n\"Section 41. Inventories. \u2014 Whenever in the judgment of the Commissioner, the use of inventories is necessary in order to determine clearly the income of any taxpayer, inventories shall be taken by such taxpayer upon such basis as the Secretary of Finance, upon the recommendation of the Commissioner, may, by rules and regulations, prescribe as conforming as nearly as may be to the best accounting practice in the trade or business and as most clearly reflecting the income.\n\nIf a taxpayer, after having complied with the terms and conditions prescribed by the Commissioner, uses a particular method of valuing its inventory for any taxable year, then such method shall be used in all subsequent taxable years unless:\n\n(i) with the approval of the Commissioner, a change to a different method is authorized;or\n\n(ii) the Commissioner finds that the nature of the stock on hand (e.g.,its scarcity, liquidity, marketability and price movements) is such that inventory gains should be considered realized for tax purposes and, therefore, it is necessary to modify the valuation method for purposes of ascertaining the income, profits, or loss in a more realistic manner: Provided, however, That the Commissioner shall not exercise its authority to require a change in inventory method more often than once every three (3) years: Provided, further, That any change in an inventory valuation method must be subject to approval by the Secretary of Finance.\" (Emphasis provided.)\n\nIn relation, to the above section of the Tax Code, Section 145 of Revenue Regulations No. 2 states: ETHIDa\n\n\"Section 145. Valuation of Inventories. \u2014 The law provides two tests to which each inventory must conform. \u2014 (1) it must conform as nearly as possible to the best accounting practice in the trade or business, and (2) it must clearly reflect the income. It follows, therefore, that inventory rules can not be uniform but must give effect to trade customs which come within the scope of the best accounting practice in the particular trade or business. In order to clearly reflect income, the inventory practice of a taxpayer should be consistent from year to year, and greater weight is to be given to consistency than to any particular method of inventory or basis of valuation, as long as the method of basis used is substantially in accord with these regulations, an inventory that can be used under the best accounting practice in a balance sheet showing the financial position of the taxpayer is, as a general rule, regarded as clearly reflecting his income.\"\n\nSince the change in ALCON LABORATORIES (PHILIPPINES),INC.'s accounting method is the result of its use of a new Computerized Accounting System known as SAP ERP 6.0, upon which the current method of costing Merchandise Inventory, the Weighted Average Method is no longer supported, and the Company's need to align its inventory costing method with its global organizations, the Company is hereby granted permission to use the Standard Costing Method of inventory provided that such method conforms to the best accounting practice in its trade or business and will clearly reflect the income of the Company pursuant to the provision of Section 41 of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended.\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be ascertained that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R.

Ortigas Jr. Road\nOrtigas Center, 1605 Pasig City, Metro Manila\n\nAttention: AAA\n\nGentlemen :\n\nThis refers to your letter dated August 5, 2019 requesting on behalf of your client, Cyanean Ventures Corporation for a ruling that the transfer and/or assignment of shares of stocks (\"Cyanean Shares\") by BBB, CCC and DDD (\"Assignors-Trustees\") in favor of the real beneficial owner thereof, EEE (\"EEE\"),is not subject to income tax, capital gains tax (CGT) and documentary stamp tax (DST).\n\nAs represented, the Assignors-Trustees executed on March 9, 2011 an Indemnity Agreement and Deed of Acknowledgment and Declaration of Trust with Deed of Assignment in favor of EEE for all Cyanean Shares registered in their respective names covered and evidenced by Stock Certificate Nos. _______, and _________. In said documents, the Assignors-Trustees manifested, acknowledged and confirmed that the capital and funds used to acquire the aforesaid shares belonged to EEE and that the said stock certificates were merely put in their names as trustees for the benefit of EEE. It further stated that Assignors-Trustees hold such stock certificates in trust for EEE who is the real beneficial owner of such stock certificates and they waive whatever rights, title and interest they may have over said certificates. Moreover, said document states that for and in consideration of the fact that the capital and funds used to acquire the said shares belonged to said beneficial owner and in the implementation of the trust reposed by said EEE, the Assignors absolutely assign, transfer, return and convey the said Stock Certificate Nos. _________, and _________ of Cyanean Ventures Corporation to EEE free from any lien and/or encumbrances of any nature whatsoever.\n\nIn reply, please be informed as follows:\n\n1. Section 24 (C) of the 1997 Tax Code, as amended, provides \u2014\n\n\"(C) Capital Gains from Sale of shares of Stock not Traded in the Stock Exchange. [1] \u2014 The provisions of Section 39(B) notwithstanding, a final tax at the rate of fifteen percent (15%) is hereby imposed upon the net capital gains realized during the taxable year from the sale, barter, exchange or other disposition of shares of stock in a domestic corporation, except shares sold, or disposed of through the stock exchange.\"\n\nIn several cases, this Office had occasion to rule that the transfer of shares of stocks in a domestic corporation held by a Trustee in favor of the Trustor without monetary consideration is not subject to income tax and CGT since the transfer is merely a confirmation of title/ownership in favor of the beneficial owner hence, not a sale, barter or exchange of the said shares of stock. [2]\n\nApplying the foregoing, the transfer of the Cyanean Shares from the Trustees, BBB, CCC and DDD to the Trustor, EEE, the real owner thereof, without monetary consideration and by virtue of the Indemnity Agreement and Deed of Acknowledgment and Declaration of Trust with Deed of Assignment is not subject to income tax and CGT.\n\n2. Well-settled in our jurisprudence is the fact that the essential elements of a valid donation are: (1) the reduction of the patrimony of the donor, (2) the increase in the patrimony of the donee; and (3) the intent to do an act of liberality (animus donandi).\n\nClearly, there is no intention on the part of BBB, CCC and DDD to donate to EEE the Cyanean Shares which the former held in trust for the latter as shown by the execution of the Indemnity Agreement and Deed of Acknowledgment and Declaration of Trust with Deed of Assignment. Thus, the aforesaid transfer and/or assignment of the subject shares will not be subject to gift tax since there is no intention to donate, and the transaction is merely to be treated as a continuation and confirmation of ownership in favor of the ultimate and real beneficiary of the Cyanean Shares. AIDSTE\n\n3. Under Section 191 of the Documentary Stamp Tax Regulations (Revenue Regulations No. 26), the conveyance of property to a trustee is exempt from DST. Section 191 of said Regulations provides:\n\n\"Section 191. Conveyance to trustees or from trustee to cestui que trust,without consideration. \u2014 Conveyances to a trustee without valuable consideration, or from a trustee to a cestui que trust without valuable consideration are not subject to tax.\"\n\nAccordingly, the transfer of the said Cyanean Shares is not subject to DST imposed under Section 176 of the 1997 Tax Code, as amended. However, the notarial acknowledgment is subject to the DST of P30.00 pursuant to Section 188 of the same Tax Code as amended by Republic Act No. 10963 or the TRAIN Law.\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be ascertained that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R. DULAY\nCommissioner of Internal Revenue\n\n1. The capital gains tax on sale of shares of stock not listed and not traded in a local stock exchange was increased from 5%/10% to 15% by RA 10963.\n\n2.

The revocation was authenticated by an Apostille in Florida, USA and as such, it can be used here in the Philippines since our country is a member of Apostille Convention.\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\nIt is the legal opinion of this Office that the 3 sets of Absolute Deed of Sale x x x, are considered null and void for lack of authority of AAA to represent BBB. Along this line, this Office, would recommend not to honor any transaction relative to these 3 sets of Deed of Sale. On the other hand, the Deed of Sale dated May 26, 2020 may be accepted and honored by the BIR since the authority of AAA was not yet revoked.\"\n\nBased on the documents submitted, the case owes its genesis to the Special Power of Attorney executed by BBB (BBB) authorizing AAA (AAA) to, among other things, cause the preparation and signing on the Deed of Absolute Sale/Deed of Donation, or to dispose by way of Sale/Donation BBB's paraphernal/exclusive properties located at Tandag City, Surigao del Sur; and sign, execute, deliver and process whatever documents/instruments necessary to carry into effect the transfer of ownership of BBB's properties from her name to that of the Buyer's/Donee's thereof.\n\nBy virtue of the said SPA, four Deeds of Absolute Sale were executed bearing the following dates: May 26, 2020; May 29, 2020 and September 7, 2020. Subsequently, AAA went to process the issuance of an electronic Certificate Authorizing Registration (eCAR) with the Revenue District Office No. 106-Tandag City.\n\nUnknown to AAA, BBB executed a revocation of Special Power of Attorney with Irrevocable Instructions to Convey Documents to CCC which was presented to OIC Revenue District Officer Lisa Tomaneng to stop the processing of the eCAR.\n\nOIC Revenue District Officer Tomaneng requested for a legal opinion from the Revenue Region on the validity of sale of parcels of land which was made by AAA. The Legal Division then issued the Subject Memorandum.\n\nHence this letter for reconsideration. acEHCD\n\nIn reply, please be informed that the guidelines in the processing and issuance of the Certificate Authorizing Registration (CAR) is well-grounded in Revenue Memorandum Order (RMO) No. 15-2003, \"Policies, Guidelines and Procedures in Processing and Monitoring of One-Time Transactions (ONETT) and the issuance of Certificates Authorizing Registration (CARs) Covering Transactions Subject to Final Capital Gains Tax on Sale of Real Properties Considered as Capital Assets as well as Capital Gains Tax on the Net Capital Gain on Sale, Transfer or Assignment of Stocks Not Traded on the Stock Exchange(s), Expanded Withholding Tax on Sale of Real Properties Considered as Ordinary Assets, Donor's Tax, Estate Tax and Other Taxes including Documentary Stamp Tax Related to the Sale/Transfer of Properties\" dated May 8, 2003.\n\nThe Bureau cannot turn blind on the principle that [t]ax laws are civil in nature. [1] In the case of Farida Yap Bitte, et al. vs. Spouses Fred and Rosa Jonas [2] the Supreme Court, speaking through Justice Jose Catral Mendoza, had the occasion to deliberate the legal consequences of a revoked agency insofar as third party is concerned, viz.:\n\n\"Basic is the rule that the revocation of an agency becomes operative, as to the agent, from the time it is made known to him. Third parties dealing bona fide with one who has been accredited to them as an agent, however, are not affected by the revocation of the agency, unless notified of such revocation. This refers to the doctrine of apparent authority. Under the said doctrine, acts and contracts of the agent within the apparent scope of the authority conferred on him, although no actual authority to do such acts or has been beforehand withdrawn, revoked or terminated, bind the principal. Thus, as to a third person, apparent authority, when present, trumps restrictions that the principal has privately imposed on the agent. The relevant appearance is that the principal has conferred authority on an agent. An actor may continue to possess apparent authority although the principal has terminated the actor's actual authority or the agency relationship between them. This is so because a third party may reasonably believe that the actor continues to act as an agent and within the scope of actual authority on the basis of manifestations previously made by the principal. Such a manifestation, once made, remains operative until the third party has notice of circumstances that make it unreasonable to believe that the actor continues to have actual authority. Hence, apparent authority may survive the termination of actual authority or of an agency relationship.\n\nTo persons who relied in good faith on the appearance of authority, no prejudice must be had by virtue of such reliance on what appeared to them as perfectly in accordance with the observable authority of an agent. It must not be disturbed unless it can be shown that they had been notified or became aware of the termination of the agency. Stated differently, a third party cannot be bound by a revocation unless he had notice or knowledge of such revocation.\n\nThe notice or knowledge may be actual or implied. In either case, there is no apparent authority to speak of and all contracts entered into by the former agent with a third person cannot bind the principal. The reason behind this is that a third person cannot feign ignorance of facts which should have put him on guard and which he had a means of knowing.\n\nApparent authority ends when it is no longer reasonable for the third party with whom an agent deals to believe that the agent continues to act with actual authority.\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\nUnder Article 1924 of the New Civil Code, \"an agency is revoked if the principal directly manages the business entrusted to the agent, dealing directly with third persons.\" Logic dictates that when a principal disregards or bypasses the agent and directly deals with such person in an incompatible or exclusionary manner, said third person is deemed to have knowledge of the revocation of the agency. They are expected to know circumstances that should have put them on guard as to the continuing authority of that agent. The mere fact of the principal dealing directly with the third person, after the latter had dealt with an agent, should be enough to excite the third person's inquiring mind on the continuation of his authority.\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\nIt is a basic axiom in civil law embodied in our Civil Code that no one may contract in the name of another without being authorized by the latter, or unless he has by law a right to represent him. A contract entered into in the name of another by one who has no authority or legal representation, or who has acted beyond his powers, shall be unenforceable, unless it is ratified, expressly or impliedly, by the person on whose behalf it has been executed, before it is revoked by the other contracting party. Considering that the sale was executed by an agent whose authority, be it actual or apparent, had been revoked, the transaction is unenforceable pursuant to Articles 1317 and 1403(1) of the Civil Code which read:\n\nArticle 1317.  No one may contract in the name of another without being authorized by the latter, or unless he has by law a right to represent him.\n\nA contract entered into in the name of another by one who has no authority or legal representation, or who has acted beyond his powers, shall be unenforceable, unless it is ratified, expressly or impliedly, by the person on whose behalf it has been executed, before it is revoked by the other contracting party. (1259a)\n\nArticle 1403.  The following contracts are unenforceable, unless they are ratified:\n\n(1) Those entered into the name of another person by one who has been given no authority or legal representation, or who has acted beyond his powers;\n\nxxx xxx xxx\"\n\nIn this case, the actual notice of revocation of agency executed by no less than the principal, BBB renders AAA's power of attorney inoperative insofar as this Bureau is concerned. The unenforceability of AAA's power of attorney constitutes a want on the mandatory requirements provided under RMO No. 15-2003 which warrants this Bureau to refrain from issuing the said CARs on the subject deeds of sale. SDHTEC\n\nIn the same vein, the apparent issue clouding the resolution of the controversy lies upon a determination which this Bureau is not accorded by law to take cognizance of. The concerned parties should submit their grievances to the appropriate Courts for proper adjudication.\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be disclosed that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R.

Exempt Transactions.\u2014 Exempt Transactions. \u2014\n\n(1) Subject to the provisions of Subsection (2) hereof, the following transactions shall be exempt from the value-added tax:\n\n(T) [1]  Sale, importation or lease of passenger or cargo vessels and aircraft, including engine, equipment and spare parts thereof for domestic or international transport operations;\"\n\nIn relation thereto, Section 4.109-1 (B) (1) (t) of the Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 16-2005, as amended by RR No. 15-2015, which implements the above-quoted provision, provides:\n\n\"SECTION 4.109-1. VAT-Exempt Transactions. \u2014\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(B) Exempt transactions. \u2014\n\n(1) Subject to the provisions of Subsection (2) hereof, the following transactions shall be exempt from VAT:\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(t) Sale, importation or lease of passenger or cargo vessels and aircraft, including engine, equipment and spare parts thereof for domestic or international transport operations; Provided, however, that the exemption from VAT on the importation and local purchase of passenger and/or cargo vessels shall be subject to the requirements on restriction on vessel importation and mandatory vessel retirement program of MARINA.\"\n\nIt is noted that LCT \"Lady Callista\" is a 2020-built, 1,221.00 GT, Deck Cargo Vessel and has been issued by MARINA with the required authority to be imported. Hence, the importation of the said cargo vessel by Kargamine Too, Inc. is deemed compliant with the requirements on restriction on vessel importation and mandatory vessel retirement program of MARINA. Accordingly, the importation by Kargamine Too, Inc. of LCT \"Lady Callista\" shall be exempt from VAT pursuant to Section 109 (1) (T) of the NIRC of 1997, as amended. The VAT exemption, however, shall be subject to the strict compliance of the conditions contained in the letter of approval issued by MARINA for the importation of the subject vessel. (BIR Ruling No. 260-19 dated May 7, 2019)\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be disclosed that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R.

Valero Sts.\nSalcedo Village, 1227, Makati City\n\nAttention: AAA\n_______________\n\nGentlemen :\n\nThis refers to your letter dated January 4, 2021, requesting on behalf of your client, Toyota Motor Philippines Savings & Loan Association, Inc. (\"TMP-SLAI\") for confirmation of your opinion that it is exempt from the imposition of income tax and value-added tax (VAT) pursuant to Republic Act (RA) No. 8367.\n\nDocuments show that TMP-SLAI, with Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) ____________ and with principal address at Toyota Santa Rosa Complex, Pulong Sta. Cruz, Santa Rosa, Laguna 4026, is a corporation organized under Philippine laws. It is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under Company Registration No. AN093-00340. It has been issued with Certificate of Authority No. NS-092 to operate as a non-stock savings and loan association by the Central Bank of the Philippines (now, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas).\n\nIn reply, please be informed as follows:\n\nIncome Tax\n\nSection 5 of RA No. 8367, otherwise known as the \"Revised Non-Stock Savings and Loan Act of 1997\" provides:\n\n\"SECTION 5. Tax Exemption. \u2014 An Association shall be exempt from payment of tax in respect to income it receives, including interest on its deposits with any bank; Provided, however, That income derived from any of its properties, real or personal, or any activity conducted for profit, regardless of the disposition thereof, is subject to the corresponding internal revenue taxes imposed under the National Internal Revenue Code.\n\nInterest earnings on deposits of members with Associations, as well as the shares of its members from the net income of the Associations shall be exempt from income tax.\"\n\nBased on the foregoing, TMP-SLAI shall be exempt from income tax with respect to income it receives. Also, interest income derived by it from its deposit and deposit substitutes are exempt from twenty percent (20%) final withholding tax.\n\nHowever, any income derived by TMP-SLAI from any of its properties, real or personal, or any activity conducted for profit, regardless of the disposition thereof, is subject to the applicable income tax and other internal revenue taxes imposed under National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended (Tax Code). It is subject to the applicable income tax depending on the classification of its properties as capital or ordinary asset. CAIHTE\n\nValue-Added Tax\n\nSection 109 (1) (V) of the Tax Code reads:\n\n\"SEC. 109. Exempt Transactions. \u2014\n\n(1) Subject to the provisions of Subsection (2) hereof, the following transactions shall be exempt from the value-added tax:\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(V) Services of bank, non-bank financial intermediaries performing quasi-banking functions, and other non-bank financial intermediaries;\"\n\nClearly, under the above provision of law, services of other non-bank financial intermediaries are exempt from VAT. Since TMP-SLAI is a non-stock savings and loan association considered as other non-bank financial intermediary, it therefore follows that its services falling under the contemplated definition of non-bank financial intermediary pursuant to law and its existing regulations are exempt from VAT.\n\nDocumentary Stamp Tax\n\nAs provided under Section 5 of RA No. 8367, a non-stock savings and loan association is exempt from income tax only. Thus, TMP-SLAI, as a non-bank financial intermediary, is subject to documentary stamp tax (DST) under the provisions of Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 13-2004 implementing Title VII of the Tax Code, particularly on loan agreements, mortgages, pledges, foreclosures and sales, among others.\n\nMoreover, pursuant to RR No. 9-2000, whenever TMP-SLAI is one of the parties to a taxable transaction, it shall be responsible for the remittance of the DST due regardless of who will bear the burden of paying the DST.\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be ascertained that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R. DULAY\nCommissioner of Internal Revenue",

Floirendo, Panabo City\nDavao 8105, Philippines\n\nAttention: AAA\n_______________\n\nGentlemen :\n\nThis refers to your letter dated October 18, 2019 requesting for ruling or approval to change its accounting method on inventory costing from First-In-First-Out (FIFO) to Moving Average Method for materials and supplies inventory starting January 1, 2019.\n\nAs represented, DAVAO AGRITECH, INC., with Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) 000-000-000-000, is a corporation duly organized and existing under and by virtue of Philippine laws with office address at Brgy. A.O. Floirendo, Panabo City, Davao 8105. It is engaged in the aerial application of insecticides, defoliants, fertilizer and seeds and other similar products over the agricultural lands as well as rain-making, cloud-seeding, reforestation, crop-dusting and crop-spraying, ranch top-dressing, aerial surveys, aerial photography, aerial photogrammerty and other agricultural, industrial and commercial activities by air including passenger and cargo air charter transport services.\n\nSince its incorporation, the Company has consistently adopted the FIFO method in costing its spare parts and supplies. In order to facilitate its cost accounting and optimize the use of its computerized system, the Company will install computerized cost accounting system. The Computerized Accounting System (CAS) to be adopted is Systems Applications and Products (SAP) Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Software which recognizes the Moving Average method for spare parts and supplies. Correspondingly, the Moving Average Method will be a more effective costing method for the valuation of inventories and will best conform to the Company's accounting practice as said valuation method will clearly reflect its income. EcTCAD\n\nConsequently, per its Corporate Secretary's Certificate, the Board of Directors approved and authorized the Company to change its inventory costing method for its Spare Parts and Supplies items from their respective previous costing methods under Microsoft GP ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) Software to their new costing methods under SAP (Systems Applications and Products) ERP Software. Hence, the request for a ruling providing for the approval to change accounting method on inventory costing, viz.:\n\nInventory\n\nFrom\n\nTo\n\nSpare Parts\n\nFIFO\n\nMoving Average\n\nSupplies\n\nFIFO\n\nMoving Average\n\nIn reply, please be informed that Section 41 of the National Internal Revenue Code (Tax Code) of 1997, as amended, provides:\n\n\"Section 41. Inventories. \u2014 Whenever in the judgment of the Commissioner, the use of inventories is necessary in order to determine clearly the income of any taxpayer, inventories shall be taken by such taxpayer upon such basis as the Secretary of Finance, upon the recommendation of the Commissioner, may, by rules and regulations, prescribe as conforming as nearly as may be to the best accounting practice in the trade or business and as most clearly reflecting the income.\n\nIf a taxpayer, after having complied with the terms and conditions prescribed by the Commissioner, uses a particular method of valuing its inventory for any taxable year, then such method shall be used in all subsequent taxable years unless:\n\n(i) with the approval of the Commissioner, a change to a different method is authorized; or\n\n(ii) the Commissioner finds that the nature of the stock on hand (e.g., its scarcity, liquidity, marketability and price movements) is such that inventory gains should be considered realized for tax purposes and, therefore, it is necessary to modify the valuation method for purposes of ascertaining the income, profits, or loss in a more realistic manner: Provided, however, That the Commissioner shall not exercise its authority to require a change in inventory method more often than once every three (3) years: Provided, further, That any change in an inventory valuation method must be subject to approval by the Secretary of Finance.\" (Emphasis provided.)\n\nIn relation, to the above section of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, Section 145 of Revenue Regulations No. 2 states:\n\n\"Section 145. Valuation of Inventories. \u2014 The law provides two tests to which each inventory must conform. \u2014 (1) it must conform as nearly as possible to the best accounting practice in the trade or business, and (2) it must clearly reflect the income. It follows, therefore, that inventory rules can not be uniform but must give effect to trade customs which come within the scope of the best accounting practice in the particular trade or business. In order to clearly reflect income, the inventory practice of a taxpayer should be consistent from year to year, and greater weight is to be given to consistency than to any particular method of inventory or basis of valuation, as long as the method or basis used is substantially in accord with these regulations, an inventory that can be used under the best accounting practice in a balance sheet showing the financial position of the taxpayer is, as a general rule, regarded as clearly reflecting his income.\"\n\nSince the change in DAVAO AGRITECH, INC.'s accounting method is in order to clearly reflect the income of the said corporation in line with its adoption of the Systems Applications and Products (SAP) Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Software which uses the moving average method rather than the FIFO method of inventory costing, DAVAO AGRITECH, INC. is hereby granted permission to change its accounting method from FIFO to Moving Average method starting January 1, 2019 pursuant to the provision of Section 41 of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, provided that such method conforms to the best accounting practice in its trade or business and will clearly reflect the income of the corporation.\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be ascertained that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void. HSAcaE\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R.

It is not registered as a corporation or as a partnership in the Philippines.\n\nThe Commissioner of Inland Revenue of the British Virgin Islands issued a Certificate of Tax Exemption certifying that AACF is not subject to any provisions of the Income Tax Ordinance and the Stamp Law pursuant to Section 242 (1) and (3) of the BVI Business Companies Act of 2004.\n\nAACF has shareholdings in offshore jurisdictions such as the Philippines, from which it receives recurring dividends from its investment in Universal Robina Corporation with office address at 43rd Floor, Robinsons Equitable Tower, ADB Avenue corner Poveda Street, Ortigas Center, Pasig City.\n\nOn April 18, 2013, the Board of Directors of Universal Robina Corporation approved the declaration of a regular cash dividend in the amount of One Peso and Fifty Centavos (P1.50) per share and a special cash dividend in the amount of Ninety Centavos (P.90) per share from the unrestricted retained earnings of the Corporation, to all stockholders of record as of May 10, 2013 and payable on June 6, 2013.\n\nYou now request for confirmation that the cash dividends to be received by AACF from Universal Robina Corporation are subject to the 15% preferential final withholding tax rate prescribed in Section 28 (B) (5) (b) of the Tax Code, as amended. CAIHTE\n\nIn reply thereto, please be informed that Section 28 (B) (5) (b) of the Tax Code, as amended, provides:\n\n\"(B) Tax on Nonresident Foreign Corporation. \u2014\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(5) Tax on Certain Incomes Received by a Nonresident Foreign Corporation. \u2014\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(b) Intercorporate Dividends. \u2014 A final withholding tax at the rate of fifteen percent (15%) is hereby imposed on the amount of cash and/or property dividends received from a domestic corporation, which shall be collected and paid as provided in Section 57(A) of this Code, subject to the condition that the country in which the non-resident foreign corporation is domiciled, shall allow a credit against the tax due from the non-resident foreign corporation taxes deemed to have been paid in the Philippines equivalent to twenty percent (20%),which represents the difference between the regular income tax of thirty-five percent (35%) and the fifteen percent (15%),on dividends as provided in this subparagraph; Provided, That effective January 1, 2009, the credit against the tax due shall be equivalent to fifteen percent (15%),which represents the difference between the regular income tax of thirty percent (30%) and the fifteen percent (15%) tax on dividends.\"\n\nBased on the foregoing Section, cash and/or property dividends received by a non-resident foreign corporation from a domestic corporation, collected and paid in accordance with Section 57 (A) of the Tax Code, as amended, are subject to a final tax rate of 15% of the total amount therefor, subject to the condition that the country in which the non-resident foreign corporation is domiciled allows a credit against the tax due from the non-resident foreign corporation taxes deemed to have been paid in the Philippines equivalent to the rate of fifteen percent (15%) beginning January 1, 2009 of such dividend. (BIR Ruling No. 494-12 dated July 31, 2012)\n\nIn the case of Commissioner of Internal Revenue vs. Wander Philippines, Inc., 160 SCRA 573 [1988] the Supreme Court had occasion to rule that exemption from taxes by the country of domicile of the non-resident corporate stockholder on dividends received, is sufficient basis for the applicability of the 15% tax rate. Thus:\n\n\"While it may be true that claims for refund are construed strictly against the claimant, nevertheless, the fact that Switzerland did not impose any tax on the dividends received by Glaxo from the Philippines should be considered as a full satisfaction of the given condition. For, as aptly stated by respondent court, to deny private respondent the privilege to withhold only 15% tax provided for under Presidential Decree No. 369 amending Section 24 (b) (1) of the Tax Code, would run counter to the very spirit and intent of said law and definitely will adversely affect foreign corporation's interest here and discourage them from investing capital in our country.\"\n\nThe above ruling was reiterated in the case of Caltex (Philippines), Inc. vs. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, CTA Case No. 4986 dated October 6, 1995, wherein it was held that the dividends remitted by a domestic corporation to a resident of Bermuda is subject to 15% withholding tax inasmuch as Bermuda does not impose any tax on dividends received by corporations domiciled therein, pursuant to the Exempted Undertaking Tax Protection Act of 1966.\n\nSince the International Business Companies Ordinance of the Territory of the British Virgin Islands under which AACF was incorporated does not impose any tax on dividends received from foreign sources, which would include those received from Philippine corporations by foreign corporations domiciled therein, then said cash dividends received by AACF from Universal Robina Corporation is subject only to the preferential withholding tax rate of 15% imposed under Section 28 (B) (5) (b) of the Tax Code, as amended. [1]\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be ascertained that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R.

Era\u00f1a\nSVP, Chief Finance Officer\n\nGentlemen :\n\nThis refers to your letter dated January 18, 2021 requesting on behalf of Petron Corporation (\"PETRON\") for a confirmatory ruling that PETRON, being a Freeport Area of Bataan (FAB) Registered Enterprise as shown by the Certificate of Registration No. 2021-077 with the supporting Certificate of Tax Incentives, both issued by the Authority of the Freeport Area of Bataan (AFAB) on December 28, 2020, is entitled to the following fiscal incentives pursuant to the provisions of Republic Act (RA) No. 9728, [1] also known as \"The Freeport Area of Bataan Act of 2009,\" as amended by RA No. 11453, [2] to wit: CAIHTE\n\na. Tax and duty-free importation of merchandise which include raw materials, capital equipment, machineries and spare parts;\n\nb. Exemption from export wharfage dues, export taxes, imposts, and fees; and\n\nc. VAT zero-rating of local purchases subject to compliance with the requirements of the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) and the Authority of the Freeport of Bataan (AFAB).\n\nIt is represented that PETRON (Tax Identification No. ________), is a domestic corporation organized and existing under the laws of the Philippines. It has a branch located at Alangan, Limay, Bataan, (hereinafter referred to as Petron Bataan Refinery) which was issued the following permits: (1) Permit to Operate No. ELTRD (P)-028-12-20-33871 and (2) Commingling Permit No. ELTRD (P)-028-12-20-33890 [3] both issued on December 22, 2020 and valid until December 31, 2021.\n\nIt is further represented that PETRON is engaged in the importation of crude oil through Petron Bataan Refinery. The crude oil is processed into a full range of petroleum products, such as gasoline, diesel, Jet A1 fuel, LPG, etc. In certain instances, PETRON resorts to importation of finished petroleum products, such as when the projected local production of specific petroleum products is not sufficient to supply the respective projected demand, or when Petron Bataan Refinery is on total plant shutdown due to repairs and maintenance. All finished petroleum products, both locally-produced and imported, are withdrawn from the Petron Bataan Refinery and are delivered either directly to domestic and foreign customers or to Petron's terminals in various locations throughout the country for eventual sale and delivery to various customers, including tax-exempt entities. In addition, PETRON imports various machinery, equipment, spare parts necessary for the Petron Bataan Refinery's operation, repair and maintenance.\n\nPursuant to the provisions of RA No. 9728, as amended by RA No. 11453, the AFAB has declared the Petron Bataan Refinery located at Limay, Bataan as a Freeport Area of Bataan (FAB) Expansion Area. Likewise, PETRON has been approved as a FAB Registered Enterprise within the FAB Expansion Area effective December 28, 2020, as evidenced by Certificate of Registration No. 2021-077 issued by the AFAB. The scope of PETRON's registered business activity is:\n\n\"operation of oil refinery facility with the primary purpose to purchase or otherwise acquire, store, hold, transport, use, experiment with, market, distribute, exchange, sell and otherwise dispose of, import, export, handle, trade and generally deal in, refine, treat, reduce, distill, manufacture and smelt any and all kinds of petroleum and petroleum products, oil, gas, and other volatile substance, ozokerite, sulphur, clays, bituminous substances, carbon, carbon black, hydrocarbon substances of all grades, kinds, forms, descriptions and combinations, and in general, sub oil products and subsurface deposits of every nature and description and the products and by-products which may be derived, produced, prepared, developed, compounded, made or manufactured therefrom and substances obtained by mixing any of the foregoing with other substances; and to purchase, create, generate or otherwise acquire, use, sell, supply or otherwise dispose of, electric current and electric steam and water power of every kind and description and to sell, supply or otherwise dispose of light, heat and power of every kind and description at the Freeport Area of Bataan (FAB).\"\n\nOn the basis of such registration, PETRON has been declared lawfully entitled to rights, privileges, benefits and/or incentives granted under RA No. 9728.\n\nIn reply thereto, please be informed as follows:\n\nTax and Duty-Free Importation of Merchandise\nwhich Include Raw Materials, Capital Equipment,\nMachineries and Spare Parts\n\nRA No. 9728, as amended by RA No. 11453 provides:\n\n\"Sec. 4. Governing Principles. \u2014 The FAB shall be managed and operated under the following principles:\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(e) The FAB shall be managed and operated as a separate customs territory ensuring free flow or movement of goods and capital within, into and out of its territory: x x x\n\n(f) The FAB shall provide incentives such as tax and duty-free importations of raw materials, capital and equipment to registered enterprises located therein. However, exportation or removal of goods from the territory of the FAB to the other parts of the Philippine territory shall be subject to customs duties and taxes under the Tariff and Customs Code of the Philippines, as amended, and the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) of 1997, as amended;\n\nxxx xxx xxx\" (Underscoring supplied)\n\nFurther, Section 55 of the Rules and Regulations implementing the provisions of RA No. 9728, as amended, provides: DETACa\n\n\"SECTION 55. Tax and Duty Exemption. \u2014 In general, all articles may be imported by FAB Registered Enterprises into the FAB free of customs and import duties and national internal revenue taxes, subject to pertinent laws, rules and regulations. x x x\n\nImportation to FAB\n\nWith regard to the importation of foreign articles, such as raw materials, capital equipment, machineries and spare parts, into the FAB, as long as the articles remain in the FAB or re-exported to another foreign jurisdiction, they shall continue to be tax-free.\n\nIn a case decided by the Supreme Court, it ruled that when goods are brought into a Freeport Zone, the goods remain to be in foreign territory and are not therefore goods introduced into Philippine customs territory subject to Philippine customs and tax laws. The Supreme Court further explained that \"stated differently, goods brought into and traded within a Freeport zone are generally beyond the reach of national internal revenue taxes and customs duties enforced in the Philippine customs territory. This is consistent with the incentive granted to Freeport Zones exempting the importation itself from taxes and duties.\" [Secretary of Finance Cesar B. Purisima and Commissioner of Internal Revenue Kim S. Jacinto-Henares vs. Representative Carmelo F. Lazatin and Economic Plastic Enterprises Corporation, G.R. No. 210588 (2016)]\n\nTherefore, under RA No. 9728, as amended by RA No. 11453, FAB is considered a customs territory separate and distinct from the Philippine customs territory. As long as the goods remain in the FAB or re-exported to another foreign jurisdiction, the importation shall continue to be tax-free. However, when goods are removed from the territory of the FAB and brought to other parts of the Philippine territory, they shall be subject to applicable taxes under the Tax Code of 1997, as amended. Thus, the act of bringing in goods into the FAB is not a taxable importation and shall not be subject to taxes imposed upon importations into the Philippine customs territory.\n\nSale, Barter, Exchange or Lease of Goods, Properties, and\nSale or Exchange of Services within the FAB/from FAB\nto Another Freeport Zone/for Direct Export\n\nAnent the sale, exchange, barter or lease of goods, properties and sale or exchange of services within the FAB or from the FAB to another freeport zone or for direct export, the same are not subject to value-added tax (VAT).\n\nTransactions within FAB\n\nRevenue Memorandum Circular (RMC) No. 50-2007 provides that:\n\n\"SECTION 3. CLARIFICATORY QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS. \u2014\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\nQ6: Since the Freeport Zones are considered as foreign soil and therefore, a separate tax jurisdiction, what is the VAT treatment of sale, exchange, barter or lease of goods, properties and/or services by a Freeport Zone-registered enterprise or Resident within the Freeport Zone?\n\nA6: Such sale, exchange, barter or lease of goods, properties and services within the subject Freeport Zones shall be exempt from VAT. The following transactions are covered under this exemption:\n\na. All transactions between and/or among two registered Freeport Zone Enterprises or Residents;\n\nb. Consumer goods purchased and consumed within the Freeport Zones;\n\nc. Sale/supply of services, including power or electricity, by a Freeport Zone-registered enterprise or resident within the Freeport Zone, regardless of whether or not the buyer or customer is a registered Freeport Zone enterprise or Zone Resident, provided that said power/electricity or services are rendered, used or consumed within the Freeport Zone; and\n\nd. The lease of properties owned by Freeport Zone-registered enterprises or Residents, provided that such properties are located within the subject Freeport Zones.\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\nQ9: What is the tax treatment of a sale of service or lease of properties (machineries and equipment) by Freeport Zone-registered enterprises to a customer or lessee from the Customs Territory? aDSIHc\n\nA9: The sale of service shall be exempt from VAT if the service is performed or rendered within the Freeport Zone.\n\nThe lease of properties, on the other hand, shall likewise be exempt from VAT if the property is located within the Freeport Zone. However, if the properties (machineries and equipment) leased by the Freeport Zone-registered enterprise is located outside of the Freeport Zone, payments to such enterprise will be considered as royalties and subject to the final withholding VAT of 12%.\n\nxxx xxx xxx\"\n\nIt is, thus, clear under RMC No. 50-2007 that the sale, exchange, barter or lease of goods, properties and services within the FAB shall be exempt from VAT subject to the following conditions, to wit:\n\na. For sale, barter or exchange of consumer goods, it must be purchased and consumed within the FAB;\n\nb. For sale of services, it must be rendered or performed within the FAB; and\n\nc. For lease of properties, including machineries and equipment, the property must be located within the FAB. (BIR Ruling No. 750-2018)\n\nTransactions from FAB to Another Freeport Zone and Direct Export\n\nThe Supreme Court reiterated the government's policy governing Freeport Zones under RA No. 7227 of \"converting into alternative productive uses, former military reservations and their extensions, as well as providing them incentives to enhance the benefits that would be derived from them in promoting economic and social development.\" These Freeport Zones therefore, by legal fiction, are regarded as foreign territories. This legal fiction is necessary to give meaningful effect to the policies of the special law creating the said Freeport Zone. (CIR vs. Seagate Technology (Philippines), G.R. No. 153866, February 11, 2005 and CIR vs. Toshiba Information Systems (Philippines), Inc., G.R. No. 150154, August 9, 2005)\n\nIn pursuance to said policy, as long as the goods remain within the freeport zone or exported to foreign countries or to other freeport zone regarded as a foreign territory, the same shall not be subject to VAT.\n\nExemption from Export Wharfage Dues,\nExport Taxes, Imposts, and Fees\n\nThe powers and duties of Bureau of Internal Revenue only comprehend the assessment and collection of national internal revenue taxes, fees, and charges. Hence, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue has no power to interpret the provisions relating to export wharfage dues, export taxes, impost and fees, which is vested with the Commissioner of Customs. Hence, we suggest to address the matter to the Bureau of Customs.\n\nVAT Zero-Rating of Purchases from the Customs Territory into the FAB\n\nAs regards local purchases by FAB registered entities from the customs territory, please be informed that the Philippine VAT system adheres to the \"cross border doctrine,\" which basically means that no VAT shall be imposed to form part of the cost of goods destined for consumption outside the territorial border of the Philippine customs territory.\n\nThe Supreme Court has consistently ruled that (u)nder the cross border principle of the VAT system being enforced by the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR), no VAT shall be imposed to form part of the cost of goods destined for consumption outside of the territorial border of the taxing authority. If exports of goods and services from the Philippines to a foreign country are free of the VAT, then the same rule holds for such exports from the national territory \u2014 except specifically declared areas \u2014 to an Ecozone, or in this case, a Freeport Zone. (CIR vs. Seagate and CIR vs. Toshiba; ibid.)\n\nMoreover, Section 108 (B) (3) of the NIRC, as amended, states that:\n\n\"Section 108. Lease of Properties. \u2014 Value-Added Tax on Sale of Services and Use or Lease of Properties. \u2014\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(B) Transactions Subject to Zero Percent (0%) Rate. \u2014 The following services performed in the Philippines by VAT-registered persons shall be subject to zero percent (0%) rate:\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(3) Services rendered to persons or entities whose exemption under special laws or international agreements to which the Philippines is a signatory effectively subjects the supply of such services to zero percent (0%) rate\";\n\nRevenue Regulations (RR) No. 16-2005, as amended, implementing the above-quoted provision states:\n\n\"SECTION 4.108-5. (a) Zero-Rated Sale of Services. \u2014\n\n(a) Zero-Rated Sale of Services. \u2014 In general. \u2014 A zero-rated sale of service (by a VAT-registered person) is a taxable transaction for VAT purposes, but shall not result in any output tax. However, the input tax on purchases of goods, properties or services related to such zero-rated sale shall be available as tax credit or refund in accordance with these Regulations.\n\n(b) Transactions Subject to Zero Percent (0%) VAT Rate. \u2014 The following services performed in the Philippines by a VAT-registered person shall be subject to zero percent (0%) VAT rate:\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(3) Services rendered to persons or entities whose exemption under special laws or international agreements to which the Philippines is a signatory effectively subjects the supply of such services to zero percent (0%) rate\";\n\nFurthermore, RMC No. 50-2007 also provides:\n\n\"SECTION 3. CLARIFICATORY QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS. \u2014\n\nQ1: How will the sale, barter or exchange of goods or properties into the Freeport Zone by suppliers/contractors from the Customs Territory be considered?\n\nA1: Such transactions shall be considered as export sales in accordance with RA No. 7227, as amended by RA No. 9400, which provides that the Freeport Zones shall be operated and managed as a separate customs territory.\n\nMoreover, Executive Order (EO) No. 226 provides that sales from the Customs Territory to export processing zones are considered \"export sales.\"\n\nQ2: What will be the treatment of sale, barter, exchange or lease of goods, properties and sale or exchange of services to a registered Freeport Zone enterprise by sellers/contractors from the Customs Territory?\n\nA2: If the seller is a VAT taxpayer, such sale, barter or exchange shall be subject to VAT at zero (0%) percent. If the seller is a non-VAT taxpayer, the transaction shall be exempt from VAT.\n\nQ3: What is meant by a \"zero-rated\" sale and an \"exempt\" sale?\n\nA3: A zero-rated sale of goods, properties and/or services (by a VAT-registered person) is a taxable transaction for VAT purposes, but shall not result in any output tax. However, the input tax on purchases of goods, properties or services, related to such zero-rated sale, shall be available as tax credit or refund in accordance with existing regulations. Under this type of sale, no VAT shall be shifted or passed-on by VAT-registered sellers/suppliers from the Customs Territory on their sale, barter or exchange of goods, properties or services to the subject registered Freeport Zone enterprises.\n\nA VAT-exempt transaction, on the other hand, refers to the sale of goods, properties or services or the use or lease of properties that is not subject to VAT (output tax) under Section 109 of the Tax Code of 1997, and the seller/supplier is not allowed any tax credit of VAT (input tax) on purchases related to such exempt transaction. TIADCc\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\nQ5: What is the coverage of VAT zero-rating?\n\nA5: The zero-rating will cover sale, barter, exchange or lease of all goods, properties and/or services by a VAT-registered seller/contractor from the Customs Territory to a Freeport Zone-registered enterprise and shall include, among others, the following:\n\na. The sale/supply of ordinary cars, vehicles, automobiles, specialized vehicles or other transportation equipment, provided that these are used exclusively within the subject special Freeport Zones;\n\nb. The lease of properties by VAT-registered lessors, provided that such properties are located within the subject Freeport Zones;\n\nc. The sale/supply of electricity by the National Power Corporation (\"NPC\") or by any other VAT-registered seller/supplier from the Customs Territory, to any registered Freeport Zone enterprise engaged in the distribution of power or electricity within the subject Freeport Zones; and\n\nd. The sale/supply of services, provided such services are rendered or performed within the Freeport Zone.\"\n\nBased on the foregoing, if the seller from the customs territory is a VAT registered taxpayer, the sale, barter, exchange, lease of goods, properties and sale or exchange of services into the FAB shall be subject to VAT at rate of zero (0%) percent. However, if the seller is registered as a non-VAT taxpayer, the transaction shall be exempt from VAT.\n\nTransactions from FAB into the Customs Territory\nare Subject to Applicable Taxes\n\nRA No. 9728, as amended by RA No. 11453 provides:\n\n\"Sec. 4. Governing Principles. \u2014 The FAB shall be managed and operated under the following principles:\n\n(f) The FAB shall provide incentives such as tax and duty-free importations of raw materials, capital and equipment to registered enterprises located therein. However, exportation or removal of goods from the territory of the FAB to the other parts of the Philippine territory shall be subject to customs duties and taxes under the Tariff and Customs Code of the Philippines, as amended, and the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) of 1997, as amended;\n\nxxx xxx xxx\" (Emphasis supplied)\n\nMoreover, Section 57 of the Rules and Regulations implementing RA No. 9728, as amended, provides as follows:\n\n\"SECTION 56. Articles Removed or Withdrawn from FAB. \u2014 Notwithstanding the above-mentioned tax and duty exemptions, foreign articles removed, withdrawn or otherwise disposed of from the FAB into the Customs Territory, shall be subject to the payment of customs duties and internal revenue taxes as ordinary importations in accordance with the provisions of the Tariff and Customs Code of the Philippines, as amended, and the National Internal Revenue Code, as amended, and other applicable laws.\n\nArticles entered or introduced from the FAB into the Customs Territory will be presumed to be foreign unless there is sufficient evidence presented to satisfy customs officials that they are domestic articles as defined in these Rules.\"\n\nIn relation thereto, RMC 50-2007 provides:\n\n\"SECTION 3. CLARIFICATORY QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS. \u2014\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\nQ8: What is the tax treatment of sale, barter or exchange of goods and properties by Freeport Zone-registered enterprises to a buyer from the customs territory? (i.e., from the Freeport Zone into the Customs Territory)\n\nA8: The sale, barter or exchange shall be treated as a technical importation made by the buyer in the customs territory. The buyer shall be treated as the importer and shall be imposed the corresponding import taxes and duties prior to release of the goods or merchandise from Customs custody. Any unpaid taxes thereon, aside from being the prime liability of the buyer-importer, shall constitute a lien on such goods or merchandise imported from the Freeport Zone. AIDSTE\n\nQ9: What is the tax treatment of a sale of service or lease of properties (machineries and equipment) by Freeport Zone-registered enterprises to a customer or lessee from the Customs Territory?\n\nA9: The sale of service shall be exempt from VAT if the service is performed or rendered within the Freeport Zone.\n\nThe lease of properties, on the other hand, shall likewise be exempt from VAT if the property is located within the Freeport Zone. However, if the properties (machineries and equipment) leased by the Freeport Zone-registered enterprise is located outside of the Freeport Zone, payments to such enterprise will be considered as royalties and subject to the final withholding VAT of 12%.\n\nxxx xxx xxx\"\n\nBased on the above-mentioned provisions, once the goods are withdrawn from the territory of the FAB and brought into the customs territory, they cease to enjoy the tax privileges accorded to FAB registered entities. It shall then be considered as an importation subject to all applicable national internal revenue taxes. However, with respect to sale of services, even if the customer is from the customs territory but the service is performed or rendered within the FAB, the transaction is exempt from VAT. Also, in case of lease of properties, as long as the property leased by FAB-registered enterprise to a lessee from customs territory is located within the Freeport Zone, it shall likewise be exempt from VAT.\n\nGoods from FAB in Transit to\nCustoms Territory for Outright Exportation\n\nFinally, PETRON contends that in instances wherein goods are withdrawn from the FAB and are admitted to the customs territory for outright exportation to another foreign jurisdiction, the same shall not be subject to payment of taxes pursuant to Section 61 of the Implementing Rules and Regulations of RA No. 9728, as amended which states that:\n\n\"SECTION 61. Transit of Articles by Carriers. \u2014 Carriers that undertake to transship articles from the FAB to designated freeport areas, special economic zones, export processing zones and bonded warehouses within the Customs Territory shall be bonded in an amount to be determined by the AFAB which in no case shall be less than FIFTY THOUSAND PESOS (P50,000.00), Philippine currency, conditioned that the carrier shall transport and deliver the articles, without delay, and in accordance with applicable rules and regulations, to the Collector of Customs at the port of destination or export. The provisions of the Tariff and Customs Code, as amended, and its implementing regulations, in respect of transshipment of articles from the ports in the Customs Territory to the FAB shall govern cases of transshipment.\"\n\nAs earlier discussed, for so long as the goods are exported outright to a foreign country or to other freeport zone deemed as foreign territory such as designated freeport areas, special economic zones, export processing zones and bonded warehouses within the customs territory, the same shall not be subject to VAT. In the same manner, goods withdrawn from the FAB and transported in transit to another Port of Entry for outright exportation to another foreign territory shall not be subject to the payment of taxes, provided that it fully complies with the conditions as well as with the necessary security imposed by the Bureau of Customs, the FAB and the BIR on goods transported for outright exportation. This tax-free transit of goods within customs territory is governed by RA No. 1066, existing rules and regulations of the Bureau of Customs such as the Customs Administrative Order (CAO) No. 15-2019 as properly cited by PETRON, the fuel marking guidelines and other applicable revenue issuances by the BIR imposing, among others, a permit for the shipment, posting of surety bond and proof of exportation. Non-compliance with the aforesaid conditions shall subject the goods withdrawn from FAB to the payment of applicable taxes and duties, including penalties, surcharges and interests.\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the facts and documents as represented and submitted. However, if upon investigation, the BIR ascertains that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R.

(\"BDO Life Holdings\"), as the absorbed corporation, and BDO Life Assurance Company, Inc. (\"BDO Life\"), as the surviving corporation, is a tax-free transfer/exchange pursuant to Section 40 (C) (2) in relation to Section 40 (C) (6) (b) of the National Internal Revenue Code, as amended (the \"Tax Code\").\n\nBackground\n\nBDO Life Holdings is a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the Philippines with Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Company Registration No. A199909579 and Tax Identification Number (TIN) 000-000-000-000, having its principal place of business at BDO Corporate Center, 7899 Makati Avenue, Makati City. BDO Life Holdings is engaged in the business of acquiring, purchasing, exchanging, assigning, gifting, and selling, assigning, transferring, exchanging, leasing, letting, developing, mortgaging, pledging, dealing, or otherwise operating, enjoying and disposing of all properties of every kind, and description, real, personal or otherwise, and wherever situated.\n\nBDO Life, on the other hand, is a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the Philippines with SEC Company Registration No. A199910386 and TIN 000-000-000-000, having its principal place of business at BDO Corporate Center, 7899 Makati Avenue, Makati City. BDO Life is engaged in the business of carrying on the business of life insurance in all its branches.\n\nBDO Life Holdings and BDO Life deemed it necessary and advisable to merge the corporations into one, with BDO Life as the surviving corporation, in order that greater efficiency and economy in the management and operations of the corporations may be achieved to their and their stockholders' advantage and welfare, since the corporations own, hold, and manage various assets for the same beneficial owner.\n\nThe Plan of Merger was approved by a majority of the Board of Directors of BDO Life Holdings at its special meeting held on November 24, 2016, and was approved by a majority of the Board of Directors of BDO Life at its special meeting held on November 24, 2016. CAIHTE\n\nThe Plan of Merger was approved by the stockholders of BDO Life Holdings (\"BDO Life Holdings Shareholders\") representing at least 2/3 of its outstanding capital stock at a special stockholders' meeting held on December 3, 2016, and was approved by the stockholders of BDO Life (\"BDO Life Shareholders\") representing at least 2/3 of its outstanding capital stock at a special stockholders' meeting held on December 3, 2016.\n\nThe SEC approved the Articles and Plan of Merger on September 4, 2017, by virtue of which the SEC issued a Certificate of Filing of the Articles and Plan of Merger. Under the approved Articles and Plan of Merger, the merger shall become effective on the date when the Certificate of Merger shall have been issued and released by the SEC. Accordingly, the merger took effect on September 4, 2017 (\"Effective Date of Merger\").\n\nPursuant to the Plan of Merger, BDO Life will issue a total of 15,931,324 shares to the BDO Life Holdings Shareholders, which shares are composed of the 15,150,505 shares reacquired by BDO Life as a consequence of the merger, and 780,819 shares from the unissued authorized capital stock of BDO Life.\n\nBDO Life Holdings (Prior to the Effective Date of Merger)\n\nType of Share\n\nAuthorized\n\nIssued and Outstanding\n\nPar Value\n\nNo. of Shares\n\nAmount\n\nCommon\n\n400,000 shares\n\n100,002 shares\n\nP_____\n\n100,002\n\nP__________\n\nPreferred\n\n3,300,000 shares\n\n2,983,800 shares\n\nP_____\n\n2,983,800\n\nP__________\n\nBDO Life (Prior to the Effective Date of Merger)\n\nType of Share\n\nAuthorized\n\nIssued and Outstanding\n\nPar Value\n\nNo. of Shares\n\nAmount\n\nCommon\n\n10,000,000 shares\n\n2,500,002 shares\n\nP_____\n\n2,500,002\n\nP__________\n\nPreferred\n\n14,000,000 shares\n\n12,650,503 shares\n\nP_____\n\n12,650,503\n\nP__________\n\nBeginning on the Effective Date of Merger, the authorized capital stock and issued and outstanding capital stock of BDO Life are as follows:\n\nBDO Life (Beginning the Effective Date of Merger)\n\nType of Share\n\nAuthorized\n\nIssued and Outstanding\n\nPar Value\n\nNo. of Shares\n\nAmount\n\nCommon\n\n10,000,000 shares\n\n2,525,319 shares\n\nP_____\n\n2,525,319\n\nP__________\n\nPreferred\n\n14,000,000 shares\n\n13,406,005 shares\n\nP_____\n\n13,406,005\n\nP__________\n\nBased on the foregoing representations, you now request for your confirmation that:\n\n1. The statutory merger of BDO Life and BDO Life Holdings qualifies for non-recognition of gain or loss for income tax purposes in accordance with Sections 40 (C) (2) in relation to 40 (C) (6) (b) of the Tax Code. Therefore, no gain or loss shall be recognized by BDO Life and BDO Life Holdings on the transfer of all assets and assumption of liabilities pursuant to the Articles and Plan of Merger, and neither BDO Life and BDO Life Holdings will be subject to income tax, withholding tax, or capital gains tax on the transfer. HEITAD\n\n2. The transfer of assets by BDO Life Holdings to BDO Life pursuant to the merger is not subject to DST under Sections 199 (e) and (m) of the Tax Code.\n\n3. The surrender by the BDO Life Holdings Shareholders of their BDO Life Holdings shares pursuant to the merger is not subject to DST.\n\n4. The DST at the rate of P1.00 on each P200 par value, or fractional part thereof, shall be imposed on the following: (a) original issuance of BDO Life shares in favor of the BDO Life Holdings Shareholders as a consequence of the merger; and (b) issuance of BDO Life shares that were previously owned by BDO Life Holdings and were reacquired by BDO Life as a consequence of the merger, in favor of the BDO Life Holdings Shareholders.\n\n5. The transfer of assets by BDO Life Holdings to BDO Life will not be considered as a transfer of property for an insufficient consideration subject to Donor's Tax since there is no intention to donate on the part of BDO Life Holdings and that the merger was undertaken purely for legitimate business purposes.\n\n6. The transfer of assets by BDO Life Holdings to BDO Life pursuant to the merger is not subject to value-added tax (VAT).\n\n7. Since the legal and beneficial ownership of excess creditable withholding taxes were effectively transferred to BDO Life as a consequence of the merger, BDO Life as the surviving corporation is now entitled to exercise all the attributes of ownership over them. Hence, BDO Life is entitled to carry forward and apply these excess creditable withholding taxes as credit against its Minimum Corporate Income Tax (MCIT) or regular corporate income tax liabilities.\n\nIn reply thereto, please be informed as follows:\n\n1. The foregoing merger of BDO Life and BDO Life Holdings is a merger within the contemplation of Section 40 (C) (2), in relation to Section 40 (C) (6) (b) of the Tax Code, as amended, because BDO Life shall acquire/assume all the assets and liabilities of BDO Life Holdings and the same is necessary and advisable and is to the advantage and welfare of the merging corporations and their respective stockholders since the corporations own, hold, and manage various assets for the same beneficial owner. Hence, the merger of BDO Life and BDO Life Holdings is being undertaken for a bona fide business purpose and not for the purpose of escaping the burden of taxation.\n\nThe merger of BDO Life and BDO Life Holdings qualifies for non-recognition of gain or loss for income tax purposes in accordance with Section 40 (C) (2) of the Tax Code, as amended, in that no gain or loss shall be recognized by BDO Life Holdings, as the transferor of all assets and liabilities, to BDO Life pursuant to the Articles and Plan of Merger.\n\nAccordingly, no gain or loss shall be recognized by BDO Life, as the transferee, on its receipt of the assets and liabilities of BDO Life Holdings pursuant to and as a consequence of the merger.\n\nThe basis of the shares of stocks to be received by Shareholders of BDO Life Holdings upon the exchange shall be the same as the basis of the properties, stocks or securities exchanged, decreased by (1) the money received, and (2) the fair market value of the other property/ies received and increased by (a) the amount treated as dividend of the shareholders and (b) the amount of any gain that was recognized in the exchange. (Sec. 40 (C) (5) (a) of the Tax Code) ATICcS\n\nThe basis of the property transferred in the hands of the transferee (BDO Life), listed in Annex \"A\" hereof, shall be the same as it would be in the hands of the transferor (BDO Life Holdings) increased by the amount of the gain, if any, recognized to the transferor on the transfer. (Sec. 40 (C) (5) (b), supra)\n\nIf the amount of the liabilities assumed plus the amount of the liabilities to which the property is subject exceed the total of the adjusted basis of the property transferred pursuant to such exchange, then such excess shall be considered as a gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset or of property which is not a capital asset, as the case may be. (Sec. 40 (C) (4) (b), supra)\n\nThe substituted bases of the properties transferred by BDO Life Holdings to BDO Life should strictly comply with the rule that cash and other cash items will be excluded from the computation of the adjusted bases of the properties transferred for purposes of determining whether liabilities assumed and to which the property is subject do not exceed the adjusted basis of the property transferred, pursuant to No. IV (A) (2) of Revenue Memorandum Ruling (RMR) No. 2-2002 dated June 10, 2002. ETHIDa\n\nAccordingly, the allocated shares and the substituted basis of the properties transferred by BDO Life Holdings shall be as follows:\n\nAssets\n\nAmount\n\nAllocated Liabilities\n\nAllocated Shares\n\nSubstituted Basis\n\nCash in bank\n\n__________\n\n2,121\n\n__________\n\nAvailable-for-sale financial assets-net\n\n__________\n\n_____\n\n1,790,920\n\n__________\n\nAccrued income\n\n__________\n\n_____\n\n311\n\n__________\n\nInvestments in subsidiaries\n\n__________\n\n_____\n\n14,137,972\n\n__________\n\nTotal\n\n__________ [1]\n\n_____\n\n15,931,324\n\n__________\n\nLiabilities\n\nAmount\n\nTrade and other liabilities\n\n__________\n\nTotal\n\n__________\n\n2. No DST is due on the transfer of assets, consisting mainly financial assets, of BDO Life Holdings to BDO Life pursuant to the Articles and Plan of Merger under Section 199 (m) of the Tax Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 9243, in relation to Section 40 (C) (2) of the Tax Code, as amended.\n\nFurthermore, no DST is due on the transfer of shares of stock listed and traded through the local stock exchange that are legally and beneficially owned by BDO Life Holdings to BDO Life pursuant to the merger under Section 199 (e) of the Tax Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 9648.\n\n3. No DST is due on the surrender by the BDO Life Holdings Shareholders of their BDO Life Holdings shares of stock for cancellation pursuant to the merger under Section 199 (m) of the Tax Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 9243, in relation to Section 40 (C) (2) of the Tax Code, as amended.\n\n4. Pursuant to Section 174 of the Tax Code, as amended, DST at the rate of P1.00 on each P200 par value, or fractional part thereof, shall be imposed on the following: (a) original issuance of BDO Life shares in favor of the BDO Life Holdings Shareholders as a consequence of the merger; and (b) issuance of BDO Life shares that were previously owned by BDO Life Holdings and were reacquired by BDO Life as a consequence of the merger, in favor of the BDO Life Holdings Shareholders.\n\n5. Well-settled in our jurisprudence is the fact that the essential elements of a valid donation are: (1) the reduction of the patrimony of the donor; (2) the increase in the patrimony of the donee; and (3) the intent to do an act of liberality (animus donandi).\n\nClearly, there is no intention on the part of any of the parties to the merger \u2014 BDO Life Holdings to donate to BDO Life its assets since the transaction is purely for a legitimate business purpose. Thus, the merger will not be subject to donor's tax since there is no intention to donate, and the transaction is a bona fide merger effected solely for business reasons.\n\n6. The transfer of assets/properties of BDO Life Holdings to BDO Life as a consequence of merger is not subject to value-added tax (VAT) pursuant to Section 105 of the Tax Code, as amended. The transfer of assets/properties to effectuate a merger is not made in the course of business but by operation of law pursuant to the merger. cSEDTC\n\n7. The excess and unutilized creditable withholding taxes (CWT) of the absorbed corporation, BDO Life Holdings, as of the effective date of the merger, which form part of the assets to be transferred by the absorbed corporation to BDO Life as a consequence of the merger, may be applied as a tax credit by BDO Life against its income tax due for the taxable year 2017, the effective date of the merger being September 4, 2017, and in the succeeding taxable years, or may be the subject of a claim for refund or issuance of a tax credit certificate (TCC).\n\n8. It is to be emphasized, however, that the net operating loss carry-over (NOLCO), under Section 34 (D) (3) of the Tax Code, and as implemented by RR No. 14-2001, of the Tax Code, of the Absorbed Corporation, if any, is not one of the assets of the latter that can be transferred and absorbed by the surviving corporation, as this privilege or deduction can be availed of by the absorbed corporation only. Accordingly, the tax-free merger between BDO Life Holdings and BDO Life does not cover the NOLCO of the former.\n\nHowever, in order that the above-described reorganization can be considered as merger under Section 40 (C) (2) and (6) (b) of the Tax Code, the parties to the merger should comply with the following requirements set forth under Revenue Regulations No. 18-2001:\n\nA. The plan of reorganization should be adopted by each of the corporations, parties thereto, the adoption being shown by the acts of its duly constituted responsible officers and appearing upon the official records of the corporation. Each corporation, which is a party to the reorganization, shall file, as part of its return for the taxable year within which the reorganization occurred a complete statement of all facts pertinent to the non-recognition of gain or loss in connection with the reorganization, including:\n\n1. A copy of the plan of reorganization, together with a statement executed under the penalties of perjury, showing in full the purposes thereof and in detail all transactions incident to, or pursuant to the plan;\n\n2. A complete statement of all cost or other basis of all property, including all stocks or securities, transferred incident to the plan;\n\n3. A statement of the amount of stock or securities and other property or money received from the exchange, including a statement of all distribution or other disposition made thereof. The amount of each kind of stock or securities and other property received shall be stated on the basis of the fair market value thereof at the date of the exchange;\n\n4. A statement of the amount and nature of any liabilities assumed upon the exchange, and the amount and nature of any liabilities to which any of the property acquired in the exchange is subject.\n\nB. Every taxpayer, other than a corporation, party to the reorganization, who received stock or securities and other property or money upon a tax-free exchange in connection with a corporate reorganization shall incorporate in his income tax return for the taxable year in which the exchange takes place a complete statement of all facts pertinent to the non-recognition of gain or loss upon such exchange, including:\n\n1. A statement of the cost or other basis of the stock or securities transferred in the exchange; and\n\n2. A statement in full of the amount of stock or securities and other property or money received from the exchange, including any liabilities assumed upon the exchange, and any liabilities to which property received is subject. The amount of each kind of stock or securities and other property (other liabilities assumed upon the exchange) received shall be set forth upon the basis of the fair market value thereof at the date of the exchange.\n\nC. Records in substantial form shall be kept by every taxpayer who participates in a tax-free exchange in connection with a corporate reorganization showing the cost or other basis of the transferred property or money received (including any liabilities assumed on the exchange, or any liabilities to which any of the properties received were subject), in order to facilitate the determination of gain or loss from subsequent disposition of such stock or securities and other property received from the exchange. SDAaTC\n\nIn addition to the foregoing requirements, the parties shall enclose with their respective income tax returns for the taxable year in which the tax-free exchange occurred a copy of the request for ruling filed with, and the corresponding ruling issued by the Bureau of Internal Revenue, both duly stamped received by the appropriate office of the Bureau of Internal Revenue. Such persons shall include as a note to their respective audited financial statements for the taxable year in which the exchange occurred a statement to the effect that they hold such assets/shares acquired in a tax-free exchange and the year in which such exchange occurred, and in the taxable years until the subject properties are subsequently transferred to another transferee.\n\nMoreover, the shareholders of both BDO Life Holdings and BDO Life shall record in their respective books of accounts the mandatory accounting entries stated in Annex \"B\" hereof, pursuant to Revenue Memorandum Order No. 17-2016.\n\nThe parties shall cause to annotate at the back of the Transfer Certificates of Title and Certificates of Stock, as the case may be, the date the deed of exchange was executed, the original or historical cost of acquisition of the properties or shares of stock involved, and the fact that no gain or loss was recognized as a result of such exchange; provided however, that any violation by the Corporate Secretary of this condition shall be penalized under Section 275 of the same Code. It is further required that within ninety (90) days from receipt of this ruling, the parties to the transaction must submit to the Law and Legislative Division, Bureau of Internal Revenue, certified true copies by the Corporate Secretary, of duly annotated Certificates of Stock, in respect of the shares of stock of transferee corporation, including the allocation of shares and computation of the substituted bases of the properties which shall be in accordance with RMR No. 2-2002.\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be disclosed that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R. DULAY\nCommissioner of Internal Revenue",

Gil Puyat Avenue\nSan Antonio, Makati City\n\nAttention: AAA\n\nMadam :\n\nThis refers to your letter dated January 21, 2021 requesting, on behalf of your client BBB, clarification relative to a Joint \"Or\" Bank Account with Survivor Agreement at the United Coconut Planters Bank (UCPB) particularly on the following:\n\n1. Whether the Bank is bound to honor the Survivorship Agreement, as stated in the signed Account Information Card issued by UCPB; and\n\n2. Whether BBB is entitled to transact with the Joint \"or\" Account; or just half of the deposited amount.\n\nIt is represented that BBB and CCC had Joint Bank Account with Survivor Agreement with UCPB. The Survivorship Agreement specifically states that:\n\n\"x x x ...all moneys, which may hereafter deposited by us, or either of us, ...shall be received and withheld by the Bank with the understanding and upon the condition that money so deposited, ...shall be the property of all/both of us as joint owners, and shall be payable and collectible by either of us during our lifetime, and upon the death of any of us, shall be payable to the surviving accountholders.\n\n\"This Joint Account Agreement with the right of survivorship shall be binding on each and all of us, our heirs, executors, administrators and assigns. ..No change or modification of this agreement shall be effective unless done in writing and signed by all of us and by the bank.\"\n\nOn April 20, 2014, CCC died.\n\nOn May 29, 2014, Revenue District Officer (RDO) Rosemarie V. Ramos-Ragasa of Revenue District Office No. 40-Cubao issued a Tax Clearance pertaining to the subject Joint \"Or\" Account.\n\nHence, this request for clarification.\n\nPrefatorily, it is worth noting that the prevailing provisions of the National Internal Revenue Code (Tax Code) of 1997, as amended during the death of the decedent applies to this peculiar situation. DETACa\n\nThus, please be informed that Section 97 of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, provides that:\n\n\"Section 97. Payment of Tax Antecedent to the Transfer of Shares, Bonds or Rights. \u2014\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\nIf a bank has knowledge of the death of a person, who maintained a bank deposit account alone, or jointly with another, it shall not allow any withdrawal from the said deposit account, unless the Commissioner has certified that the taxes imposed thereon by this Title have been paid: Provided, however, That the administrator of the estate or any one (1) of the heirs of the decedent may, upon authorization by the Commissioner, withdraw an amount not exceeding Twenty thousand pesos (P20,000) without the said certification. For this purpose, all withdrawal slips shall contain a statement to the effect that all of the joint depositors are still living at the time of withdrawal by any one of the joint depositors and such statement shall be under oath by the said depositors.\"\n\nA joint account is one that is held jointly by two or more natural persons, or by two or more juridical persons or entities. Under such setup, the depositors are joint owners or co-owners of the said account, and their share in the deposits shall be presumed equal unless the contrary is provided. [1] The nature of joint accounts is governed by the rule on co-ownership embodied in Article 485 of the Civil Code, to wit:\n\n\"Art. 485. The share of the co-owners, in the benefits as well as in the charges, shall be proportional to their respective interests. Any stipulation in a contract to the contrary shall be void.\n\nThe portions belonging to the co-owners in the co-ownership shall be presumed equal, unless the contrary is proved.\"\n\nIn the Survivorship Agreement, the joint depositors cannot withdraw any portion of the said deposit account without the consent of the other. However, upon death of any of them, the whole amount of the funds shall belong to the surviving co-depositors, and may forthwith be withdrawn by the latter. The said provision contained in the agreement is valid and binding between the joint depositors but it has an effect of a gift or donation mortis causa made by the deceased co-depositor during his lifetime but effective upon death because the acquisition by the survivor of the share of the decedent in the joint account is considered to be acquired by bequest and hence subject to estate tax under Section 84 of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended. [2]\n\nThe transfer therefore of the share of the decedent co-depositor to the surviving co-depositor upon death of the former pursuant to their Survivorship Agreement is deemed by law, a transfer made in contemplation of death as provided under Section 85 (B) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, viz.:\n\n\"Section 85. Gross Estate. \u2014 The value of the gross estate of the decedent shall be determined by including the value at the time of his death of all property, real or personal, tangible or intangible, wherever situated: Provided, however, That in the case of nonresident decedent who at the time of his death was not a citizen of the Philippines, only that part of the entire gross estate which is situated in the Philippines shall be included in his taxable estate.\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(B) Transfer in Contemplation of Death. \u2014 To the extent of any interest therein of which the decedent has at any time made a transfer, by trust or otherwise, in contemplation of or intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after death, or of which he has at any time made a transfer, by trust or otherwise, under which he has retained for his life or for any period which does not in fact end before his death (1) the possession or enjoyment of, or the right to the income from the property, or (2) the right either alone or in conjunction with any person, to designate the person who shall possess or enjoy the property or the income therefrom; except in case of a bona fide sale for an adequate and full consideration in money or money's worth.\"\n\nIn view of the foregoing, the funds in the joint deposit account cannot be withdrawn by the surviving co-depositors unless the Commissioner has certified that the taxes imposed thereon by Title III of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended have been paid; Provided, however, That the administrator of the estate or any one (1) of the heirs of the deceased co-depositor may, upon the authorization by the Commissioner, withdraw an amount not exceeding Twenty thousand Pesos (P20,000) without the said certification. [3]\n\nInsofar as to whether or not the UCPB is bound to honor the Survivorship Agreement, the Bureau inhibits to take cognizance of the matter as it is beyond its jurisdiction.\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the facts and documents as represented and submitted. However, if upon investigation, the BIR ascertains that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R.

(MMI), for a confirmatory ruling that MMI, which is directly and indirectly owned by a publicly-held corporation, is exempt from Improperly Accumulated Earnings Tax (IAET) pursuant to Section 29 of the 1997 National Internal Revenue Code of 1997 (Tax Code), as amended, and implemented by Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 2-2001.\n\nBackground\n\nMMI is a domestic corporation duly organized and existing under and by virtue of the laws of the Philippines, with its registered office and its principal place of business at 908 Quezon Avenue corner Dr. Garcia, Paligsahan, Quezon City. Likewise, MMI's primary purpose, as per its Articles of Incorporation (AOI) approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on February 2007 and was amended on January 24, 2018, to wit: \"to buy, sell, barter, trade, lease out, manufacture, import, export or otherwise acquire, dispose of, and deal with any kind of goods, wares, and merchandise such as spare parts of replacement parts and/or complete assemblies of agricultural, industrial or commercial machineries, automobiles, buses, trucks, tractors or other motor vehicles and/or related machineries and equipment of every kind and description including consumables and incidentals necessary in the proper operation of the goods, wares and merchandise, and to conduct and carry out high standard of services that are necessary and desirable in such business as manufacturers, wholesaler, importers, exporters, as indentor, commission merchant, except the manufacture of food, drugs and cosmetics including rendering after sales service repair, maintenance and enhancement.\"\n\nIt is further represented that MMI's shares of stocks is owned by the following corporate stockholders, to wit: Seventy Two Percent (72%) owned by Marubeni Corporation (Marubeni),a publicly-held corporation duly listed in the Tokyo Stock Exchange with office address at 4-2 Ohtemachi 1-chome, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo, Japan; Twenty Four Percent (24%) owned by Maxwealth Capital Resources, Inc. (Maxwealth),a domestic corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the Philippines, with office address at 908 Quezon Avenue corner Dr. Garcia, Paligsahan, Quezon City; and Four Percent (4%) by Marubeni Philippines Corporation (MPC),a domestic corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the Philippines with office address at 8th & 9th Floors, L.V. Locsin Building, Ayala Avenue corner Makati Avenue, Makati City. ATICcS\n\nIn reply, please be informed that Section 29 (A) and (B) (2) (a) of the Tax Code on the imposition of IAET, states that \u2014\n\n\"SEC. 29. Imposition of Improperly Accumulated Earnings Tax.\u2014\n\n(A) In General. \u2014 In addition to other taxes imposed by this Title, there is hereby imposed for each taxable year on the improperly accumulated taxable income of each corporation described in Subsection B hereof, an improperly accumulated earnings tax equal to ten percent (10%) of the improperly accumulated taxable income.\n\n(B) Tax on Corporations Subject to Improperly Accumulated Earnings Tax. \u2014\n\n(1) In General. \u2014 The improperly accumulated earnings tax imposed in the preceding Section shall apply to every corporation formed or availed for the purpose of avoiding the income tax with respect to its shareholders or the shareholders of any other corporation, by permitting earnings and profits to accumulate instead of being divided or distributed.\n\n(2) Exceptions. \u2014 The improperly accumulated earnings tax as provided for under this Section shall not apply to:\n\n(a) Publicly-held corporations;\n\n(b) Banks and other non-bank financial intermediaries; and\n\n(c) Insurance companies.\" (Emphasis supplied)\n\nThis kind of tax is being imposed in the nature of a penalty to the corporation for the improper accumulation of its earnings, and as a form of deterrent to the avoidance of tax upon shareholders who are supposed to pay dividends tax on the earnings distributed to them by the corporation. However, the IAET shall not apply to, among others, publicly-held corporations.\n\nFurthermore, Section 4 of Revenue Regulations No. 2-2001, \"Implementing the Provision on Improperly Accumulated Earnings Tax under Section 29 of the Tax Code of 1997,\" provides:\n\n\"For purposes of these Regulations, closely-held corporations are those corporations at least fifty-percent (50%) in value of the outstanding capital stock or at least fifty percent (50%) of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote is owned directly or indirectly by or for not more than twenty (20) individuals. Domestic corporations not falling under the aforesaid definition are, therefore, publicly-held corporations.\"\n\nFor purposes of determining whether the corporation is a closely-held corporation, it is provided that stock owned directly or indirectly by or for a corporation, partnership, estate or trust shall be considered as being owned proportionately by its shareholders, partners or beneficiaries.\n\nThus, in BIR Ruling No. 025-2002 dated June 25, 2002, this Office ruled that such shares will be considered as being owned proportionately by the shareholders. The ownership of a domestic corporation for purposes of determining whether it is closely-held corporation or a publicly-held corporation is ultimately traced to the individual shareholders of the parent company. Accordingly, where at least 50% of the outstanding capital or at least 50% of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote in a corporation is owned directly or indirectly by at least 21 or more individuals, the corporation is considered publicly-held corporation as the term is defined in RR No. 2-2001.\n\nFurthermore, in BIR Ruling No. 094-2013 dated March 18, 2013,this Office also ruled that to determine whether a corporation is publicly-held or not, is to ultimately trace to the individual shareholders of the parent company. In this BIR Ruling, the corporation involved was owned by another corporation which is wholly owned by the parent corporation. In resolving whether the corporation is a publicly-held corporation or not, this office ultimately traced the shareholdings of the individual shareholders of the parent company.\n\nSUCH BEING THE CASE, the ownership of a domestic corporation (like MMI) for purposes of determining whether it is a closely-held corporation or a publicly-held corporation is ultimately traced to the individual shareholders of the ultimate parent-company. Since MMI is 72% owned by Marubeni Corporation, a publicly-held corporation duly listed in the Tokyo Stock Exchange, MMI shall be considered as being owned by Marubeni Corporation shareholders.\n\nIn applying the foregoing principle, this Office holds that, MMI is exempt from the imposition of IAET even if it is not directly owned by Marubeni Corporation considering that for purposes of determining whether it is a closely-held corporation or a publicly-held corporation, exempt from IAET, is ultimately traced to the individual shareholders of the ultimate parent company. Considering that Marubeni Corporation owns 72% of the shares of MMI, a corporation where at least fifty percent (50%) of the outstanding capital stock or at least 50% of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote is owned directly or indirectly by more than twenty (20) individuals, the corporation is considered publicly-held corporation as the term is defined in RR No. 2-2001. (BIR Ruling No. 1398-2018 dated November 19, 2018)\n\nWHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, this Office holds that MMI is considered a publicly-held corporation, and therefore, is exempt from the imposition of IAET under Section 29 (B) (2) (a) of the Tax Code, as amended. TIADCc\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be disclosed that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R. DULAY\nCommissioner of Internal Revenue",

Ortigas, Jr. Road\nOrtigas Center, Pasig City\n\nAttention: AAA\n_______________\n\nGentlemen :\n\nThis refers to your letter dated March 6, 2017 requesting for confirmation that the merger of CIP Corporation (\"CIPCOR\"), as the absorbed corporation and CEPALCO Energy Services Corporation (\"CESCO\") [Formerly: CEPALCO Energy Services and Trading Corporation (\"CESTCO\"), qualifies as a tax-free merger under Section 40 (C) (2) of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997 (NIRC), as amended.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n1. CIPCOR is a corporation duly organized and existing under Philippine laws with principal office at 8th Floor, Strata 100 Building, F. Ortigas, Jr. Road, Ortigas Center, Pasig City. It has an authorized capital of _______________ Pesos (P__________) divided into One Million Two Hundred Thousand (1,200,000) shares at _____ Pesos (P_____) par value of which the amount of _________________________ Pesos (P__________) has been subscribed and paid. CIPCOR's primary purpose is to operate, conduct, manage, maintain and carry on the business of an ice plant, to sell, distribute or otherwise deal in block ice and its allied products. CIPCOR, being the absorbed corporation is 83.06% owned by its subsidiary Cagayan Electric Power & Light Company, Inc.\n\n2. CESCO is likewise a corporation duly organized and existing under Philippine laws with principal office at No. 44 Don Toribio Chaves Street, Cagayan de Oro City. As of June 30, 2010, it has an authorized capital of ____________________ Pesos (P__________) divided into Two Million (2,000,000) shares at __________ Pesos (P_____) par value of which the amount of _________________________ Pesos (P__________) has been subscribed and the amount of _________________________ (P__________) has been paid. CESCO is engaged in the business of general trading including but not limited to importing, buying or otherwise acquiring, holding, storing & bartering, selling in wholesale or retail of various electrical materials and equipment, etc. and to engage in rendering energy services since its incorporation on June 19, 1974. CESCO is 98.16% owned by its subsidiary Cagayan Electric Power & Light Company, Inc. SDHTEC\n\n3. CIPCOR and CESCO have agreed that a merger between them will be mutually advantageous and will result in specific benefits to them, such as but not limited to increased financial strength through pooling of resources, a more diversified and stable capital base, increased operating economies and efficiencies, and reduction of overall business expenses. Thus, pursuant to the provisions of Section of the Corporation Code of the Philippines and the relevant rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC),CIPCOR and CESCO have each adopted and executed the Articles of Merger, as approved by the majority of the Board of Directors and Stockholders representing two thirds (2/3) of the outstanding capital of each of the corporation, for the purpose of merging CIPCOR with CESCO as the surviving corporation.\n\n4. The Merger of CIPCOR and CESCO was approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of December 29, 2010.\n\n5. Pursuant to the Articles and Plan of Merger, CIPCOR will convey, assign and transfer to CESCO all its assets and liabilities existing as of June 30, 2010, while CESCO will issue a total of Ninety-Three Thousand Five Hundred Seventy-Nine (93,579) shares to the existing stockholders of CIPCOR.\n\nIn reply thereto, please be informed, as follows:\n\n1. The foregoing merger of CIPCOR and CESCO is a merger within the contemplation of Section 40 (C) (2) (a) in relation to 40 (C) (6) (b) of the NIRC, as amended, because the acquisition and assumption by CESCO of all the assets and liabilities of CIPCOR will result to an increased financial strength of the parties through pooling of resources, a more diversified and stable capital base, increased operating economies and efficiencies, and reduction of overall business expenses. Hence, the merger of CIPCOR and CESCO is being undertaken for a bona fide business purpose and not for the purpose of escaping the burden of taxation.\n\nThe merger of CIPCOR and CESCO qualifies for non-recognition of gain or loss for income tax purposes in accordance with Section 40 (C) (2) of the NIRC, as amended, that no gain or loss shall be recognized by CIPCOR, as the transferor of all assets and liabilities, to CESCO pursuant to the Plan of Merger.\n\nAccordingly, no gain or loss shall be recognized by CESCO, as the transferee, on its receipt of the assets and liabilities of CIPCOR pursuant to and as a consequence of the merger.\n\nOn the other hand, the bases of the shares of stocks to be received by the shareholders of CIPCOR upon the exchange shall be the same as the bases of the properties, stocks or securities exchanged, decreased by (1) the money received, and (2) the fair market value of the other property/ies received and increased by (a) the amount treated as dividend of the shareholders and (b) the amount of any gain that was recognized in the exchange. (Sec. 40 (C) (5) (a) of the NIRC, as amended)\n\nThe basis of the properties transferred in the hands of the transferee (CESCO) shall be the same as it would be in the hands of the transferor (CIPCOR) increased by the amount of the gain, if any, recognized to the transferor (CIPCOR) on the transfer. (Sec. 40 (C) (5) (b),supra)\n\nFinally, if the amount of the liabilities assumed plus the amount of the liabilities to which the property is subject exceed the total of the adjusted basis of the properties transferred pursuant to such exchange, then such excess shall be considered as a gain, on the part of the transferor, from the sale or exchange of a capital asset or of property which is not a capital asset, as the case may be. (Sec. 40 (C) (4) (b),supra)\n\nThe substituted basis of the properties transferred by CIPCOR to CESCO shall comply with the rule that cash and other cash items will be excluded from the computation of the adjusted basis of the properties transferred for purposes of determining whether liabilities assumed and to which the property is subject do not exceed the adjusted basis of the property transferred pursuant to No. IV (A) (2) of Revenue Memorandum Ruling (RMR) No. 2-2002 dated June 10, 2002.\n\nAccordingly, the allocated shares and liabilities, and the substituted basis of the assets transferred by CIPCOR to CESCO, based on CIPCOR's audited financial statements as of June 30, 2010 shall be as follows:\n\nAmount\n(in Php)\n\nAllocated Liabilities\n\nAllocated Shares\n\nSubstituted Basis (in Php)\n\nNon-Current Assets\n\n_________\n\n__________\n\n93,579\n\n__________\n\nTOTAL\n\n_________\n\n93,579\n\n__________\n\nLiabilities\n\nAmount (in Php)\n\nNon-current liabilities\n\n_______________\n\nTOTAL\n\n_______________\n\n2. Well-settled in our jurisprudence is the fact that the essential elements of a valid donation are: (1) the reduction of the patrimony of the donor, (2) the increase in the patrimony of the donee, and (3) the intent to do an act of liberality (animus donandi).\n\nClearly, there is no intention on the part of any of the parties to the merger \u2014 CIPCOR to donate to CESCO its assets since the transaction is purely for legitimate business purpose. Thus, the aforesaid merger will not be subject to gift tax since there is no intention to donate, and the transaction is a bonafide merger effected solely for business reasons. HESIcT\n\n3. No DST is due on the transfer of assets made pursuant to the Plan of Merger under Section 199 (m) of the NIRC, as amended by Republic Act No. 9243, in relation to Section 40 (C) (2) of the Tax Code, as amended. (BIR Ruling No. S40-0427-2020 dated July 30, 2020)\n\nHowever, a DST at the rate of P1.00 [1] on each P200 par value, or fractional part thereof, shall be imposed on the original issuance of shares by CESCO to the stockholders of CIPCOR as a consequence of the merger as provided under Section 174 of the NIRC, as amended.\n\n4. The transfer of properties of CIPCOR to CESCO as a consequence of the merger shall not be subject to any output tax, pursuant to Section 4.106-8 (b) (3) of Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 16-2005, as amended by RR No. 4-2007 and as further amended by RR No. 10-2011. The conveyance of properties to effectuate a merger is not made in the course of business but by operation of law pursuant to the merger. Thus, any unused input tax as of the effective date of merger will be absorbed by CESCO, as the surviving corporation pursuant to Section 4.106-8 (b) (3) of RR No. 16-2005, as amended by RR Nos. 4-2007 and 10-2011.\n\n5. Any excess and unutilized creditable withholding taxes (CWT),if any, which form part of the assets to be transferred by CIPCOR as of the effective date of the merger, shall be transferred to and vested in CESCO, as the surviving corporation, and such excess CWT may be utilized by the latter against its income tax liabilities for 2010 and succeeding years or may be the subject of a claim for refund or issuance of a tax credit certificate (TCC).(BIR Ruling No. 100-2017 dated March 2, 2017)\n\n6. The excess and unexpired Minimum Corporate Income Tax (MCIT), of the absorbed corporation, CIPCOR, as of the effective date of the merger, shall be carried forward and credited against the normal income tax due of the surviving corporation, CESCO, for the three (3) immediately succeeding taxable years pursuant to Section 27 (E) (2) of the NIRC, as amended. Since the excess and unexpired MCIT of CIPCOR, is among the rights, privileges, property and/or interest of CIPCOR, the excess and unexpired MCIT of the latter shall be transferred to and vested in CESCO on the effective date of the merger. Thus, CIPCOR's excess and unexpired MCIT, if any, shall be carried forward and credited against the normal corporate income tax of CESCO subject to the three-year-carry-forward period reckoned from the date of payment of CIPCOR of its MCIT.\n\n7. It is to be emphasized, however, that the net operating loss carry-over (NOLCO) under Section 34 (D) (3) of the NIRC, as amended, and as implemented by RR No. 14-2001, of CIPCOR, if any, is not one of the assets that can be transferred and absorbed by the surviving corporation, CESCO, as this privilege or deduction can be availed of by CIPCOR only. Accordingly, the tax-free merger between CIPCOR and CESCO does not cover the NOLCO of the former.\n\nIn order that the above-described reorganization can be considered as merger under Section 40 (C) (2) and (6) (b) of the NIRC, as amended, the parties to the merger should comply with the following requirements set forth under RR No. 18-2001:\n\nA. The plan of reorganization should be adopted by each of the corporations, parties thereto, the adoption being shown by the acts of its duly constituted responsible officers and appearing upon the official records of the corporation. Each corporation, which is a party to the reorganization, shall file, as part of its return for the taxable year within which the reorganization occurred a complete statement of all facts pertinent to the non-recognition of gain or loss in connection with the reorganization, including: caITAC\n\n1. A copy of the plan of reorganization, together with a statement executed under the penalties of perjury, showing in full the purposes thereof and in detail all transactions incident to, or pursuant to the plan;\n\n2. A complete statement of all cost or other basis of all property, including all stocks or securities, transferred incident to the plan;\n\n3. A statement of the amount of stock or securities and other property or money received from the exchange, including a statement of all distribution of other disposition made thereof. The amount of each kind of stock or securities and other property received shall be stated on the basis of the fair market value thereof at the date of the exchange;\n\n4. A statement of the amount and nature of any liabilities assumed upon the exchange, and the amount and nature of any liabilities to which any of the property acquired in the exchange is subject.\n\nB. Every taxpayer, other than a corporation, party to the reorganization, who received stock or securities and other property or money upon a tax-free exchange in connection with a corporate reorganization shall incorporate in his income tax return for the taxable year in which the exchange takes place a complete statement of all facts pertinent to the non-recognition of gain or loss upon such exchange, including:\n\n1. A statement of the cost or other basis of the stock or securities transferred in the exchange; and\n\n2. A statement in full of the amount of stock or securities and other property or money received from the exchange, including any liabilities assumed upon the exchange, and any liabilities to which property received is subject. The amount of each kind of stock or securities and other property (other liabilities assumed upon the exchange) received shall be set forth upon the basis of the fair market value thereof at the date of the exchange.\n\nC. Records in substantial form shall be kept by every taxpayer who participates in a tax-free exchange in connection with a corporate reorganization showing the cost or other basis of the transferred property or money received (including any liabilities assumed on the exchange, or any liabilities to which any of the properties received were subject),in order to facilitate the determination of gain or loss from subsequent disposition of such stock or securities and other property received from the exchange.\n\nIn addition to the foregoing requirements, the parties shall enclose with their respective income tax returns for the taxable year in which the merger occurred a copy of the request for ruling filed with, and the corresponding ruling issued by, the Bureau of Internal Revenue, both duly stamp-received by the appropriate office of the Bureau of Internal Revenue.\n\nSuch parties shall include as a note to their respective audited financial statements for the taxable year in which the merger occurred a statement to the effect that they hold such assets/shares acquired in a merger and the year in which such merger occurred, and in the taxable years until the subject properties are subsequently transferred to another transferee. ICHDca\n\nMoreover, the shareholders of the absorbed/dissolving corporation and the surviving/transferee corporation shall record in their respective books of accounts the mandatory accounting entries stated in Annex \"A\" hereof, pursuant to Revenue Memorandum Order (RMO) No. 17-2016.\n\nThe parties shall cause to annotate at the back of the Transfer Certificates of Title and Certificates of Stock, the date the merger was executed, the original/historical/adjusted costs of acquisition of the properties or shares of stock involved, and the fact that no gain or loss was recognized as a result of such merger; provided however, that any violation by the Corporate Secretary of this condition shall be penalized under Section 275 of the same Code. It is further required that within ninety (90) days from receipt of this ruling, the parties to the transaction must submit to the Legal and Legislative Division, Bureau of Internal Revenue, proof of annotation of the original/historical/adjusted bases of the properties and/or real properties involved in the transfer and certified true copies by the Corporate Secretary, of duly annotated Certificates of Stock, in respect of the shares of stock of the transferee corporation, including the revised allocation of shares and re-computation of the substituted bases of the properties which shall be in accordance with RMR No. 2-2002.\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be disclosed that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R.

(\"MICO\"), as the surviving corporation, with The First Nationwide Assurance Corporation (\"FNAC\") and Bankers Assurance Corporation (\"BAC\"), as the absorbed corporations, is a tax-free exchange pursuant to Section 40 (C) (2) of the National Internal Revenue Code (Tax Code) of 1997, as amended.\n\nBackground:\n\nMICO, with Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Company Registration No. 4218, is a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of Philippines, with principal office address at 4/F Yuchengco Tower I, No. 500 Quintin Paredes St., Binondo, Manila, Philippines. It is engaged in the business of insurance and reinsurance.\n\nOn the other hand, FNAC, with SEC Company Registration No. 27346, is a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of Philippines, with principal office address at 4/F Yuchengeo Tower II, No. 111 LP Leviste St. corner Gallardo St., Belair, Makati City, Philippines; while BAC, with SEC Company Registration No. 10212, is a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of Philippines, with principal office address at 4/F Yuchengeo Tower I, No. 500 Quintin Paredes St., Binondo, Manila, Philippines. Both are also engaged in the business of insurance and reinsurance.\n\nPursuant to the provisions of Sections 76 to 80 of the Revised Corporation Code of the Philippines, the respective Boards of Directors and corresponding stockholders of MICO, FNAC and BAC deemed it advisable to merge into a single corporation since a merger will: (1) help improve their competitiveness by consolidating capital and revenue and (2) reduce costs through a more efficient and productive use of common resources. Thus, the majority of the members of the respective Board of Directors of MICO, FNAC and BAC, in their respective meetings held on June 27, 2019, wherein a quorum was present and all throughout, have separately and unanimously approved the Plan of Merger. Likewise, the respective stockholders of MICO, FNAC and BAC, each representing at least two-thirds (2/3) of the outstanding capital stock of each of MICO, FNAC and BAC, in their respective meeting all held on June 27, 2019, have separately and unanimously approved the Plan of Merger. CAIHTE\n\nWhen the Plan of Merger was approved during the respective stockholders' meeting of MICO, FNAC and BAC, the number of outstanding shares of each of MICO, FNAC and BAC are as follows:\n\nMICO\n\nNo. of Shares\n\nAmount\n\nAuthorized Capital Stock\n\n10,000,000 Common Shares 5,000 Preferred Shares\n\n_______________\n\nSubscribed and Outstanding\n\n8,452,925 Common Shares\n\n_______________\n\nFNAC\n\nNo. of Shares\n\nAmount\n\nAuthorized Capital Stock\n\n2,500,000 Common Shares\n\n______________\n\nSubscribed and Outstanding\n\n2,500,000 Common Shares\n\n______________\n\nBAC\n\nNo. of Shares\n\nAmount\n\nAuthorized Capital Stock\n\n40,000,000 Common Shares\n\n_______________\n\nSubscribed and Outstanding\n\n35,000,000 Common Shares\n\n_______________\n\nThe assets, liabilities and equity of MICO, FNAC and BAC as of the agreed cut-off date of March 31, 2019 (\"Cut-off Date\") are summarized as follows:\n\nMICO\n\nAmount\n\nAmount\n\nAssets\n\n_____________\n\nLiabilities\n\n__________________\n\nEquity\n\n__________________\n\nTotal\n\n_____________\n\n-\n\n__________________\n\nFNAC\n\nAmount\n\nAmount\n\nAssets\n\n___________\n\nLiabilities\n\n_____________\n\nEquity\n\n_____________\n\nTotal\n\n___________\n\n-\n\n_____________\n\nBAC\n\nAmount\n\nAmount\n\nAssets\n\n___________\n\nLiabilities\n\n___________\n\nEquity\n\n___________\n\nTotal\n\n___________\n\n-\n\n___________\n\nOn October 30, 2019, the SEC approved the Plan and Articles of Merger. Under the approved Plan and Articles of Merger, the merger shall become effective on the first date of the month immediately following the issuance of the Certificate of Filing of the Articles and Plan of Merger by the SEC (\"Effective Date of Merger\"). DETACa\n\nAlso, pursuant to the approved Plan and Articles of Merger, upon the Effective Date of Merger, all the rights, privileges, businesses and assets of each of FNAC and BAC as of the Cut-off Date, including but not limited to real and personal properties, contractual rights, licenses, claims, receivables due on whatever account, subscriptions to shares and other choses of action, bank deposits, supplies and equipment, shall be deemed conveyed, assigned and transferred to MICO, without need for any further act or deed. Any other assets that may be acquired by each of FNAC and BAC after the Cut-off Date until the Effective Date of Merger shall also be deemed conveyed, assigned and transferred to MICO.\n\nMoreover, upon the Effective Date of Merger, MICO shall be responsible and liable for all the liabilities and obligations of each of FNAC and BAC as of the Cut-off Date, in the same manner as if MICO had itself incurred such liabilities or obligations; and any pending claim, action or proceeding by or against each of FNAC and BAC may be prosecuted by or against MICO. Any other liabilities and obligations that may be incurred by each of FNAC and BAC after the Cut-off Date until the Effective Date of Merger shall also be assumed by MICO. All the rights of the creditors of MICO, FNAC and BAC shall not be impaired by the merger.\n\nFurthermore, upon the Effective Date of Merger, the shares of each of FNAC and BAC then outstanding in the hands of its respective stockholders shall be exchanged solely for shares in MICO on the basis of the net book value of the assets of FNAC and BAC as of the Cut-off Date, as follows:\n\nNet Asset Value\n\nFNAC\n\n_______________\n\nBAC\n\n_______________\n\nBased on the above net book values, and given the net book value of MICO of P_______________, 1 MICO share shall be issued in exchange for every 4 FNAC shares, and 1 MICO share shall be issued in exchange for every 48 BAC shares. Consequently, and eliminating fractional shares, MICO shall issue a total of 1,338,419 common shares as follows:\n\na. 611,859 MICO common shares to the stockholders of FNAC, and\n\nb. 726,560 MICO common shares to the stockholders of BAC.\n\nOf the above-said shares, 1,061,331 common shares, which are to be issued to MICO in exchange for its shares in FNAC and BAC, shall be held in treasury. The shares to be issued shall be taken from the unissued shares of capital stock of MICO.\n\nIn view of the foregoing, you now request for confirmation of the following:\n\n1. the merger of MICO, as the surviving corporation, with FNAC and BAC, as the absorbed corporations, qualifies as a tax-free exchange pursuant to Section 40 (C) (2) in relation to Section 40 (C) (6) (b) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended;\n\n2. the basis of the assets and liabilities of FNAC and BAC in the hands of MICO shall be the same as it would be in the hands of FNAC and BAC;\n\n3. the resulting ownership by MICO of the properties of FNAC and BAC is not subject to income tax, capital gains tax (CGT), or donor's tax;\n\n4. the exchange by the shareholders of FNAC and BAC of their shares of stock for MICO shares and the transfer of assets of FNAC and BAC to MICO pursuant to the merger will not be subject to any output value-added tax (VAT); aDSIHc\n\n5. the unused input VAT of FNAC and BAC shall be absorbed and can be utilized by MICO; and\n\n6. the exchange by the shareholders of FNAC and BAC of their shares of stock for MICO shares is not subject to documentary stamp tax (DST); however, the issuance by MICO of its shares of stock to the stockholders of FNAC and BAC pursuant to the merger shall be subject to DST under Section 174 of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended.\n\nIn reply thereto, please be informed as follows:\n\n1. The merger of MICO with FNAC and BAC is a merger within the contemplation of Section 40 (C) (2), in relation to Section 40 (C) (6) (b) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, because MICO shall acquire/assume all the assets and liabilities of FNAC and BAC and the same is necessary and advisable since it will help improve their competitiveness by consolidating capital and revenue and reduce costs through a more efficient and productive use of common resources. Hence, said merger is being undertaken for a bona fide business purpose and not for the purpose of escaping the burden of taxation.\n\nThe merger of MICO with FNAC and BAC qualifies for non-recognition of gain or loss for income tax purposes in accordance with Section 40 (C) (2) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, and that no gain or loss shall be recognized by FNAC and BAC, as the transferors of all assets and liabilities, to MICO pursuant to the Articles and Plan of Merger.\n\nAccordingly, no gain or loss shall be recognized by MICO, as the transferee, on its receipt of the assets and liabilities of FNAC and BAC pursuant to and as a consequence of the merger.\n\nThe basis of the shares of stocks to be received by shareholders of the FNAC and BAC upon the exchange shall be the same as the basis of the properties, stocks or securities exchanged, decreased by (1) the money received, and (2) the fair market value of the other property/ies received and increased by (a) the amount treated as dividend of the shareholders and (b) the amount of any gain that was recognized in the exchange. [1]\n\nThe basis of the property transferred in the hands of the transferee (MICO) shall be the same as it would be in the hands of the transferors (FNAC and BAC) increased by the amount of the gain, if any, recognized to the transferor on the transfer. [2]\n\nIf the amount of the liabilities assumed plus the amount of the liabilities to which the property is subject exceed the total of the adjusted basis of the property transferred pursuant to such exchange, then such excess shall be considered as a gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset or of property which is not a capital asset, as the case may be. [3]\n\nThe substituted basis of the properties transferred by FNAC and BAC to MICO should strictly comply with the rule that cash and other cash items will be excluded from the computation of the adjusted basis of the properties transferred for purposes of determining whether liabilities assumed and to which the property is subject do not exceed the adjusted basis of the property transferred, pursuant to No. IV (A) (2) of Revenue Memorandum Ruling (RMR) No. 2-2002 dated June 10, 2002. ETHIDa\n\nAccordingly, the allocated shares and the substituted basis of the properties transferred by FNAC and BAC based on their respective Audited Financial Statements as of March 31, 2019 shall be as follows:\n\nFNAC\n\nAssets\n\nAmount\n\nAllocated Liabilities\n\nAllocated Shares\n\nSubstituted Basis\n\nCash and cash equivalents\n\n__________\n\n64,884\n\n__________\n\nShort-term investments\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\n935\n\n__________\n\nInsurance receivables\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\n69,061\n\n__________\n\nFinancial assets:\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\nFinancial assets at fair value through profit and loss (FVTLP)\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\n8,714\n\n__________\n\nFinancial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\n259,878\n\nInvestment asset at amortized cost\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\n131,504\n\n__________\n\nLoans and receivables\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\n25,717\n\n__________\n\nAccrued Income\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\n2,283\n\n__________\n\nDeferred acquisition costs \u2014 net\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\n9,486\n\n__________\n\nReinsurance assets\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\n23,200\n\n__________\n\nProperty and equipment\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\n10,260\n\n__________\n\nDeferred tax assets\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\n2,595\n\n__________\n\nOther assets\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\n3,342\n\n__________\n\nTotal\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\n611,859\n\n__________\n\nLiabilities\n\nAmount\n\nInsurance contract liabilities\n\n____________\n\nInsurance payables\n\n____________\n\nAccounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities\n\n____________\n\nDeferred reinsurance commission\n\n____________\n\nNet pension obligation\n\n____________\n\nIncome tax payable\n\n____________\n\nTotal\n\n____________\n\nBAC\n\nAssets\n\nAmount\n\nAllocated Liabilities\n\nAllocated Shares\n\nSubstituted Basis\n\nCash and cash equivalents\n\n__________\n\n42,048\n\n__________\n\nInsurance receivables\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\n92,173\n\n__________\n\nFinancial assets:\n\nFinancial assets at fair value through profit and loss (FVTPL)\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\n1,600\n\n__________\n\nFinancial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\n345,839\n\n__________\n\nInvestment asset at amortized cost\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\n169,557\n\n__________\n\nLoans and receivables \u2014 net\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\n31,274\n\n__________\n\nAccrued Income\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\n3,546\n\n__________\n\nDeferred acquisition costs\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\n20,092\n\n__________\n\nReinsurance assets\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\n7,373\n\n__________\n\nProperty and equipment\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\n925\n\n__________\n\nDeferred tax assets\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\n2,084\n\n__________\n\nOther assets\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\n10,049\n\n__________\n\nTotal\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\n726,560\n\n__________\n\nLiabilities\n\nAmount\n\nInsurance contract liabilities\n\n____________\n\nInsurance payables\n\n____________\n\nAccounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities\n\n____________\n\nDeferred reinsurance commission\n\n____________\n\nNet pension obligation\n\n____________\n\nIncome tax payable\n\n____________\n\nTotal\n\n____________\n\n2. Well-settled in our jurisprudence is the fact that the essential elements of a valid donation are: (1) the reduction of the patrimony of the donor; (2) the increase in the patrimony of the donee; and (3) the intent to do an act of liberality (animus donandi). TIADCc\n\nClearly, there is no intention on the part of FNAC and BAC to donate to MICO their assets since the transaction is purely for a legitimate business purpose. Thus, the merger will not be subject to donor's tax since there is no intention to donate, and the transaction is a bona fide merger effected solely for business reasons.\n\n3. The transfer of assets/properties of FNAC and BAC to MICO as a consequence of the merger is not subject to VAT pursuant to Section 105 of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended. The transfer of assets/properties to effectuate a merger is not made in the course of business but by operation of law pursuant to the merger.\n\nFurthermore, the assets/properties transferred by FNAC and BAC to MICO do not include goods or properties that are used in business, that are held for sale or for lease by the transferors, that are originally intended for sale or for use in the course of business, nor that are of any character or nature subject to VAT.\n\n4. The excess and unutilized creditable withholding taxes (CWT) of FNAC and BAC as of the effective date of the merger, which form part of the assets to be transferred by FNAC and BAC to MICO as a consequence of the merger, may be applied as a tax credit by MICO against its income tax due for the taxable year 2019, the effective date of the merger being November 01, 2019, and in the succeeding taxable years, or may be the subject of a claim for refund or issuance of a tax credit certificate (TCC).\n\n5. No DST is due on the surrender by the shareholders of FNAC and BAC of their shares in FNAC and BAC for cancellation pursuant to the merger under Section 199 (m) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended by Republic Act (RA) No. 9243, in relation to Section 40 (C) (2) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended.\n\nOn the other hand, pursuant to Section 174 of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, DST at the rate of P2.00 on each P200.00, or fractional part thereof, shall be imposed on the original issuance of shares by MICO in favor of the shareholders of FNAC and BAC as a consequence of the merger.\n\n6. It is to be emphasized, however, that the net operating loss carry-over (NOLCO) under Section 34 (D) (3) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, and as implemented by RR No. 14-2001, of FNAC and BAC, if any, is not one of their assets that can be transferred and absorbed by the surviving corporation, MICO, as this privilege or deduction can be availed of merely by FNAC and BAC. Accordingly, the tax-free merger does not cover the NOLCO of FNAC and BAC that can be transferred and absorbed by MICO.\n\nHowever, in order that the above-described reorganization can be considered as merger under Section 40 (C) (2) and (6) (b) of the Tax Code of 1997, the parties to the merger should comply with the following requirements set forth under RR No. 18-2001: AIDSTE\n\nA. The plan of reorganization should be adopted by each of the corporations, parties thereto, the adoption being shown by the acts of its duly constituted responsible officers and appearing upon the official records of the corporation. Each corporation, which is a party to the reorganization, shall file, as part of its return for the taxable year within which the reorganization occurred a complete statement of all facts pertinent to the non-recognition of gain or loss in connection with the reorganization, including:\n\n1. A copy of the plan of reorganization, together with a statement executed under the penalties of perjury, showing in full the purposes thereof and in detail all transactions incident to, or pursuant to the plan;\n\n2. A complete statement of all cost or other basis of all property, including all stocks or securities, transferred incident to the plan;\n\n3. A statement of the amount of stock or securities and other property or money received from the exchange, including a statement of all distribution of other disposition made thereof. The amount of each kind of stock or securities and other property received shall be stated on the basis of the fair market value thereof at the date of the exchange;\n\n4. A statement of the amount and nature of any liabilities assumed upon the exchange, and the amount and nature of any liabilities to which any of the property acquired in the exchange is subject.\n\nB. Every taxpayer, other than a corporation, party to the reorganization, who received stock or securities and other property or money upon a tax-free exchange in connection with a corporate reorganization shall incorporate in his income tax return for the taxable year in which the exchange takes place a complete statement of all facts pertinent to the non-recognition of gain or loss upon such exchange, including:\n\n1. A statement of the cost or other basis of the stock or securities transferred in the exchange; and\n\n2. A statement in full of the amount of stock or securities and other property or money received from the exchange, including any liabilities assumed upon the exchange, and any liabilities to which property received is subject. The amount of each kind of stock or securities and other property (other liabilities assumed upon the exchange) received shall be set forth upon the basis of the fair market value thereof at the date of the exchange.\n\nC. Records in substantial form shall be kept by every taxpayer who participates in a tax-free exchange in connection with a corporate reorganization showing the cost or other basis of the transferred property or money received (including any liabilities assumed on the exchange, or any liabilities to which any of the properties received were subject), in order to facilitate the determination of gain or loss from subsequent disposition of such stock or securities and other property received from the exchange. AaCTcI\n\nIn addition to the foregoing requirements, the parties shall enclose with their respective income tax returns for the taxable year in which the tax-free exchange occurred a copy of the request for ruling filed with, and the corresponding ruling issued by the Bureau of Internal Revenue, both duly stamped received by the appropriate office of the Bureau of Internal Revenue. Such parties shall include as a note to their respective audited financial statements for the taxable year in which the exchange occurred a statement to the effect that they hold such assets/shares acquired in a tax-free exchange and the year in which such exchange occurred, and in the taxable years until the subject properties are subsequently transferred to another transferee.\n\nMoreover, the absorbed/dissolving corporation/s, its shareholders and the surviving/transferee corporation shall record in their respective books the mandatory accounting entries stated in Annex \"A\" hereof, pursuant to Revenue Memorandum Order (RMO) No. 17-2016.\n\nFurthermore, the parties shall cause to annotate at the back of the Transfer Certificates of Title (TCT) and/or Certificates of Stock, the date the merger was executed, the original or historical cost of acquisition of the properties or shares of stock involved, and the fact that no gain or loss was recognized as a result of such merger; provided however, that any violation by the Register of Deeds or by the Corporate Secretary of this condition shall be penalized under Section 269 or 275, as the case may be, of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended. acEHCD\n\nFinally, it is required that within ninety (90) days from receipt of this ruling, the parties to the transaction must submit to the Law and Legislative Division, Bureau of Internal Revenue, certified true copies by the Corporate Secretary, of duly annotated Certificates of Stock, in respect of the shares of stock of the transferee corporation, including the revised allocation of shares and re-computation of the substituted bases of the properties which shall be in accordance with RMR No. 2-2002.\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be disclosed that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R. DULAY\nCommissioner of Internal Revenue",

(\"RSBI\"), as the absorbed corporation, is a tax-free exchange pursuant to Section 40 (C) (2) in relation to Section 40 (C) (6) (b) of the National Internal Revenue Code (Tax Code) of 1997, as amended.\n\nBackground:\n\nRCBC, with Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Company Registration No. 17514, is a universal banking corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the Republic of the Philippines, with principal place of business at Yuchengco Tower, RCBC Plaza, 6819 Ayala Avenue corner Sen. Gil J. Puyat Avenue, Makati City. It is authorized to engage in the business of expanded commercial banking; to have and exercise, subject to, and in accordance with the provisions of applicable laws, rules and regulations, all powers, rights, privileges and attributes of an expanded commercial bank; to engage in and carry on the business of a trust company; exercise the powers of investment houses as provided in pertinent laws; and have the power and authority to invest in the equity of allied and non-allied corporations, business, or undertakings, in addition to the general powers incident to corporations.\n\nOn the other hand, RSBI, with SEC Company Registration No. ASO96-00449, is a thrift banking corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the Republic of the Philippines, with principal place of business at RCBC Savings Bank Corporate Center, 26th and 25th Streets, Bonifacio Global City, Taguig City.

ATICcS\n\nRCBC and RSBI deemed it necessary and advisable to merge the corporation into a single corporation, with RCBC as the surviving corporation, as the merger will advance both corporations' long term strategic business interests. Thus, the Plan of Merger dated November 27, 2018 was approved by the majority vote of each of the board of directors of RCBC and RSBI at the meetings duly called for the purpose on November 26, 2018 and November 27, 2018, respectively. Also, at a special meeting of the stockholders of RCBC held on February 26, 2019 at Makati City, at which quorum was present and acting throughout, the stockholders owning 1,877,696,027 shares, representing 96.9% of its total issued and outstanding capital stock voted and approved the Plan of Merger, and no stockholder present at such meeting voted against it. Likewise, at a special meeting of the stockholders of RSBI held on February 18, 2019 at Makati City, at which quorum was present and acting throughout, the stockholders owning 30,872,162 common shares representing 100% of its outstanding capital stock voted and approved the Plan of Merger.\n\nOn July 22, 2019, the SEC approved the Plan and Articles of Merger. Under the approved Plan and Articles of Merger, the merger shall become effective on July 1, 2019 following the issuance by the SEC of a Certificate of Merger and subject to the approval of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) and the Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation (PDIC).\n\nAlso, pursuant to the Plan of Merger, as of the effective date, the shares of RSBI shall, without any other action on the part of the respective holders of the shares, become and be converted into the common shares of RCBC, as follows:\n\n1. RSBI shall transfer its net assets to RCBC in exchange for the common shares of RCBC. The number of RCBC common shares that will be issued pursuant to the merger shall be determined using the respective Net Asset Value (NAV) per common share of RCBC and RSBI as of December 31, 2018 as reflected in their respective Audited Financial Statements (AFS). The results of operations of RSBI from January 1, 2019 shall not affect the determination of the number of RCBC common shares that will be issued pursuant to the merger and adjustments shall not be made in the NAV per share of RCBC and RSBI after December 31, 2018. Any net income earned by RSBI from January 1, 2019 until the effective date shall be declared and paid as dividends to RCBC and any net loss incurred by RSBI during the same period shall be absorbed and for the account of RCBC.\n\n2. The procedure for determining the number of RCBC common shares that will be issued pursuant to the merger shall be as follows:\n\na. RCBC and RSBI shall determine the exchange ratio based on the following formula:\n\nRatio\n\n=\n\nRSBI NAV/No. of outstanding RSBI shares\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\nRCBC NAV/No. of outstanding RCBC shares\n\nb. The number of RCBC common shares to be issued is equivalent to the number of outstanding RSBI common shares multiplied by the Ratio.\n\nc. Any fractional shares resulting from the application of the formula shall be disregarded and rounded down to the nearest whole number of RCBC common shares.\n\n3. The RCBC common shares issued shall be acquired and recorded as treasury shares by RCBC in exchange for RCBC's investment in RSBI common shares. TIADCc\n\nFollowing the above-mentioned formula, the number of common shares to be issued by RCBC pursuant to the merger shall be 315,287,248 shares, computed based on the AFS of RCBC and RSBI as of December 31, 2018, as follows:\n\nRCBC\n\nEquity of RCBC\n\n_______________\n\nNumber of RCBC shares\n\n1,935,628,775\n\nBook value per share\n\n__________\n\nRSBI\n\nEquity of RSBI\n\n_______________\n\nNumber of RSBI shares\n\n30,872,163\n\nBook value per share\n\n__________\n\nShares to be issued\n\nBook value of RSBI shares\n\n__________\n\nBook value of RCBC shares\n\n__________\n\nRatio of shares to be issued\n\n10.21\n\nTotal RSBI issued shares\n\n30,872,163\n\nShares to be issued\n\n315,287,248\n\nAs of the date of the Articles of Merger, the respective authorized capital stock, total number of outstanding and issued shares, the par value of each share and the total paid-up capital for RCBC and RSBI are as follows:\n\nRCBC\n\nNumber of Shares\n\nAmount\n(at P_____ per share)\n\nAuthorized Capital Stock\n\n2,800,000,000\n\nP_______________\n\nOutstanding Capital Stock\n\n1,935,896,662\n\n_______________\n\nTotal Paid-up Capital\n\n1,935,896,662\n\n_______________\n\nRSBI\n\nNumber of Shares\n\nAmount\n(at P_____ per share)\n\nAuthorized Capital Stock\n\n50,000,000\n\nP_______________\n\nOutstanding Capital Stock\n\n30,872,163\n\n_______________\n\nTotal Paid-up Capital [1]\n\n30,872,163\n\n_______________\n\nBased on the foregoing representations, you now request for confirmation of the following:\n\n1. The merger of RCBC and RSBI qualifies as a tax-free exchange of property where no gain or loss shall be recognized under Section 40 (C) (2) in relation to Section 40 (C) (6) (b) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended;\n\n2. The basis of the assets and liabilities of RSBI in the hands of RCBC shall be the same as it would be in the hands of RSBI as the absorbed corporation;\n\n3. The transfer of any property pursuant to the merger is not subject to income tax, capital gains tax, or donors tax;\n\n4. The exchange by RSBI shareholders of their shares for RCBC shares and the transfer of assets of RSBI to RCBC pursuant to the merger is not subject to any output value-added tax (VAT); and\n\n5.

The merger of RCBC and RSBI is a merger within the contemplation of Section 40 (C) (2), in relation to Section 40 (C) (6) (b) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, because RCBC shall acquire/assume all the assets and liabilities of RSBI and the same is necessary and advisable and is to the advantage and welfare of the merging corporation and their respective stockholders since the corporation own, hold, and manage various assets for the same beneficial owner. Hence, the merger of RCBC and RSBI is being undertaken for a bona fide business purpose and not for the purpose of escaping the burden of taxation. SDAaTC\n\nThe merger of RCBC and RSBI qualifies for non-recognition of gain or loss for income tax purposes in accordance with Section 40 (C) (2) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, and that no gain or loss shall be recognized by RSBI, as the transferor of all its assets and liabilities, to RCBC pursuant to the Articles and Plan of Merger.\n\nAccordingly, no gain or loss shall be recognized by RCBC, as the transferee, on its receipt of the assets and liabilities of RSBI pursuant to and as a consequence of the merger.\n\nThe basis of the shares of stocks to be received by shareholders of RSBI upon the exchange shall be the same as the basis of the properties, stocks or securities they exchanged, decreased by (1) the money they received, and (2) the fair market value of the other property/ies they received and increased by (a) the amount treated as dividend of the shareholders and (b) the amount of any gain that was recognized in the exchange. [2]\n\nThe basis of the property transferred in the hands of the transferee (RCBC) shall be the same as it would be in the hands of the transferor (RSBI) increased by the amount of the gain, if any, recognized to the transferor on the transfer. [3]\n\nIf the amount of the liabilities assumed plus the amount of the liabilities to which the property is subject exceed the total of the adjusted basis of the property transferred pursuant to such exchange, then such excess shall be considered as a gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset or of property which is not a capital asset, as the case may be. [4] AaCTcI\n\nThe substituted basis of the properties transferred by RSBI to RCBC should strictly comply with the rule that cash and other cash items will be excluded from the computation of the adjusted basis of the properties transferred for purposes of determining whether liabilities assumed and to which the property is subject do not exceed the adjusted basis of the property transferred, pursuant to No. IV (A) (2) of Revenue Memorandum Ruling (RMR) No. 2-2002 dated June 10, 2002.\n\nAccordingly, the allocated shares and the substituted basis of the properties transferred by RSBI based on its AFS as of December 31, 2018 shall be as follows:\n\nAssets\n\nAmount\n\nAllocated Liabilities\n\nAllocated Shares\n\nSubstituted Basis\n\nCash and Other Cash Items\n\n__________\n\n-\n\n11,520,517\n\n__________\n\nDue from Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\n34,316,210\n\n__________\n\nDue from other banks\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\n3,226,589\n\n__________\n\nInterbank Call Loans\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\n157,903\n\n__________\n\nLoans and Receivable Arising From Reverse Repurchase Agreement\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\n13,534,536\n\n__________\n\nTrading and Investment Securities\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\n29,692,342\n\n__________\n\nLoans and Receivables\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\n211,091,154\n\n__________\n\nInvestments in Subsidiaries\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\n707,240\n\n__________\n\nBank Premises, Furniture, Fixtures, and Equipment\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\n2,296,345\n\n__________\n\nInvestment Properties\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\n3,262,447\n\n__________\n\nAssets Held-for-Sale and Disposal Group\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\n1,422,498\n\n__________\n\nDeferred Tax Assets\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\n2,054,129\n\n__________\n\nOther Resources\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\n2,005,337\n\n__________\n\nTotal\n\n_____________\n\n____________\n\n315,287,248\n\n____________\n\nLiabilities\n\nAmount\n\nDeposit Liabilities\n\n_____________\n\nManager's Check Payable\n\n_____________\n\nAccrued Interest, Taxes and Other Expenses\n\n_____________\n\nOther Liabilities\n\n_____________\n\nTotal\n\n_______________\n\n2. Well-settled in our jurisprudence is the fact that the essential elements of a valid donation are: (1) the reduction of the patrimony of the donor; (2) the increase in the patrimony of the donee; and (3) the intent to do an act of liberality (animus donandi).\n\nClearly, there is no intention on the part of any of the parties to the merger \u2014 RSBI to donate to RCBC their assets since the transaction is purely for a legitimate business purpose. Thus, the merger will not be subject to donor's tax since there is no intention to donate, and the transaction is a bona fide merger effected solely for business reasons.\n\n3. The transfer of assets/properties of RSBI to RCBC as a consequence of the merger is exempt from VAT pursuant to Section 109 (X) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended. The transfer of assets/properties to effectuate a merger is not made in the course of business but by operation of law pursuant to the merger.\n\n4. No DST is due on the transfer of assets made pursuant to the merger under Section 199 (m) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended by Republic Act (RA) No. 9243, in relation to Section 40 (C) (2) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended. Consequently, no DST is due on the surrender by RSBI shareholders of their RSBI shares for cancellation.\n\nOn the other hand, pursuant to Section 174 of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, DST at the rate of P2.00 on each P200 par value, or fractional part thereof, shall be imposed on the original issuance of shares by RCBC in favor of the shareholders of RSBI as a consequence of the merger.\n\n5. The excess and unutilized CWT of the absorbed corporation, RSBI, as of the effective date of the merger, which form part of the assets to be transferred by the absorbed corporation to RCBC as a consequence of the merger, may be applied as a tax credit by RCBC against its income tax due for the taxable year 2019, the effective date of the merger being July 22, 2019, and in the succeeding taxable years, or may be the subject of a claim for refund or issuance of a tax credit certificate (TCC). EcTCAD\n\n6. The excess and unexpired MCIT of the absorbed corporation, RSBI, as of the effective date of the merger shall be carried forward and credited against the regular corporate income tax due of the surviving corporation, RCBC, for the three (3) immediately succeeding taxable years pursuant to Section 27 (E) (2) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended. Since the excess and unexpired MCIT of RSBI are among the rights, privileges, property and/or interest of RSBI, their excess and unexpired MCIT shall be transferred to and vested in RCBC on the effective date of the merger. Thus, RSBI's excess and unexpired MCIT shall be carried forward and credited against the regular corporate income tax of RCBC subject to the three-year-carry-forward period reckoned from the date of payment of RSBI of their MCIT.\n\n7. It is to be emphasized, however, that the NOLCO under Section 34 (D) (3) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, and as implemented by Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 14-2001, of the absorbed corporation, RSBI, if any, is not one of their assets that can be transferred and absorbed by the surviving corporation, RCBC, as this privilege or deduction can be availed of merely by the absorbed corporation. Accordingly, the tax-free merger does not cover the NOLCO of RSBI that can be transferred and absorbed by RCBC.\n\n8. The retained earnings pertaining to the individual shareholders of RSBI, the absorbed corporation, are subject to the ten percent (10%) final withholding tax on dividends constructively received by its individual shareholders pursuant to Section 24 (B) (2) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended.\n\nHowever, in order that the above-described reorganization can be considered as merger under Section 40 (C) (2) and (6) (b) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, the parties to the merger should comply with the following requirements set forth under RR No. 18-2001:\n\nA. The plan of reorganization should be adopted by each of the corporation, parties thereto, the adoption being shown by the acts of its duly constituted responsible officers and appearing upon the official records of the corporation. Each corporation, which is a party to the reorganization, shall file, as part of its return for the taxable year within which the reorganization occurred a complete statement of all facts pertinent to the non-recognition of gain or loss in connection with the reorganization, including:\n\n1. A copy of the plan of reorganization, together with a statement executed under the penalties of perjury, showing in full the purposes thereof and in detail all transactions incident to, or pursuant to the plan;\n\n2. A complete statement of all cost or other basis of all property, including all stocks or securities, transferred incident to the plan;\n\n3. A statement of the amount of stock or securities and other property or money received from the exchange, including a statement of all distribution of other disposition made thereof. The amount of each kind of stock or securities and other property received shall be stated on the basis of the fair market value thereof at the date of the exchange;\n\n4. A statement of the amount and nature of any liabilities assumed upon the exchange, and the amount and nature of any liabilities to which any of the property acquired in the exchange is subject. HSAcaE\n\nB. Every taxpayer, other than a corporation, party to the reorganization, who received stock or securities and other property or money upon a tax-free exchange in connection with a corporate reorganization shall incorporate in his income tax return for the taxable year in which the exchange takes place a complete statement of all facts pertinent to the non-recognition of gain or loss upon such exchange, including:\n\n1. A statement of the cost or other basis of the stock or securities transferred in the exchange; and\n\n2. A statement in full of the amount of stock or securities and other property or money received from the exchange, including any liabilities assumed upon the exchange, and any liabilities to which property received is subject. The amount of each kind of stock or securities and other property (other liabilities assumed upon the exchange) received shall be set forth upon the basis of the fair market value thereof at the date of the exchange.\n\nC. Records in substantial form shall be kept by every taxpayer who participates in a tax-free exchange in connection with a corporate reorganization showing the cost or other basis of the transferred property or money received (including any liabilities assumed on the exchange, or any liabilities to which any of the properties received were subject), in order to facilitate the determination of gain or loss from subsequent disposition of such stock or securities and other property received from the exchange.\n\nIn addition to the foregoing requirements, the parties shall enclose with their respective income tax returns for the taxable year in which the tax-free exchange occurred a copy of the request for ruling filed with, and the corresponding ruling issued by the Bureau of Internal Revenue, both duly stamped received by the appropriate office of the Bureau of Internal Revenue. Such parties shall include as a note to their respective audited financial statements for the taxable year in which the exchange occurred a statement to the effect that they hold such assets/shares acquired in a tax-free exchange and the year in which such exchange occurred, and in the taxable years until the subject properties are subsequently transferred to another transferee.\n\nMoreover, the shareholders of the absorbed/dissolving corporation and the surviving/transferee corporation shall record in their respective books the mandatory accounting entries stated in Annex \"A\" hereof, pursuant to Revenue Memorandum Order (RMO) No. 17-2016.\n\nFurthermore, the parties shall cause to annotate at the back of the Transfer Certificates of Title (TCT) and Certificates of Stock, the date the merger was executed, the original or historical cost of acquisition of the properties or shares of stock involved, and the fact that no gain or loss was recognized as a result of such merger; provided however, that any violation by the Register of Deeds or by the Corporate Secretary of this condition shall be penalized under Section 269 or 275, as the case may be, of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended.\n\nFinally, it is required that within ninety (90) days from receipt of this ruling, the parties to the transaction must submit to the Law and Legislative Division, Bureau of Internal Revenue, certified true copies by the Corporate Secretary, of duly annotated Certificates of Stock, in respect of the shares of stock of the transferee corporation, including the revised allocation of shares and re-computation of the substituted bases of the properties which shall be in accordance with RMR No. 2-2002.\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be disclosed that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void. HESIcT\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R. DULAY\n\nCommissioner of Internal Revenue",

Schwartz, Ph.D.,City Registrar, on February 13, 2020, the Decedent died on __________ at 3:20 PM (New York, USA Time) or on __________ at 4:20 PM (Philippine Time).Also, it is represented that you are having difficulty retrieving all the requirements for the payment of the tax due because of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn reply thereto, please be informed that Section 90 (C) of the National Internal Revenue Code (Tax Code) of 1997, as amended, provides as follows:\n\n\"SEC. 90. Estate Tax Returns. \u2014\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(C) Extension of Time. \u2014 The Commissioner shall have authority to grant, in meritorious cases, a reasonable extension not exceeding thirty (30) days for filing the return.\"\n\nFurther, Section 91 (B) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, provides the allowable extension of time for the payment of the corresponding estate tax, to wit:\n\n\"SEC. 91. Payment of tax.\u2014\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(B) Extension of Time. \u2014 When the Commissioner finds that the payment on the due date of the estate tax or of any part thereof would impose undue hardship upon the estate or any of the heirs, he may extend the time for payment of such tax or any part thereof not to exceed five (5) years, in case the estate is settled through the courts, or two (2) years in case the estate is settled extrajudicially. In such case, the amount in respect of which the extension is granted shall be paid on or before the date of the expiration of the period of the extension, and the running of the Statute of Limitations for assessment as provided in Section 203 of this Code shall be suspended for the period of any such extension.\" TAIaHE\n\nBased on the foregoing representations, this Office finds justifiable reason to grant the requesting party an extension to file the estate tax return of thirty (30) days counted from February 11, 2021, which is the last day for the filing of the estate tax return of the Decedent. Considering that March 13, 2021 falls on a non-working day, the filing of the said estate tax return of the Decedent is hereby extended up to March 15, 2021.\n\nMoreover, the requesting party is also granted two (2) years, in case the estate is settled extrajudicially, or five (5) years, in case the estate is settled through the courts, within which to pay the estate tax, provided that the executor, or administrator, or beneficiary, shall furnish a bond in such amount, not exceeding double the amount of the tax and with such sureties as the Commissioner deems necessary, conditioned upon the payment of the said tax in accordance with the terms of the extension.\n\nIt shall be understood, however, that the estate shall be liable for the corresponding interest that shall have accrued thereon up to the time of payment of the estate tax due on the transmission by the said estate of its properties in favor of the heirs pursuant to Section 249 of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended.\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be disclosed that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R.

Valero Sts.\nSalcedo Village, 1227,\nMakati City, Philippines\n\nAttention: AAA\n\nSir :\n\nThis refers to your letter dated October 3, 2019 requesting on behalf of your client, Sumitomo Metal Mining Philippine Holdings Corporation (\"SMMPH\"), for confirmation that SMMPH is a publicly-held corporation and therefore exempt from the Improperly Accumulated Earnings Tax (IAET) pursuant to Section 29 of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997 (Tax Code), as amended, and implemented by Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 2-2001.\n\nIt is represented that SMMPH is a domestic corporation organized and existing under and by virtue of the laws of the Philippines, with office address at 25th Floor, NAC Tower, 32nd Street, Bonifacio Global City, Taguig City; that it is registered with the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) with Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) 000-000-000, and with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), bearing SEC Registration Number CS201009478; and that its primary purpose is to invest in, acquire by purchase, exchange, assignment or to hold, own, use for investment or otherwise, shares of capital stock, bonds, debentures, promissory notes or other securities or obligations created, negotiated or issued by any corporation, association, or other entities, whether foreign or domestic, as and to the extent permitted by law; to acquire by purchase, exchange, assignment and to sell, assign, transfer, exchange, lease, let, develop, mortgage, pledge, or otherwise deal in or operate, enjoy, dispose of, any and all properties of every kind, nature and description and wherever situated, except as may be prohibited by law, and while the owner, holder, or possessor thereof, to exercise all the rights, powers and privileges of ownership or any other interest therein, including the right to receive, collect and dispose of any and all rentals, dividends, interest and income, derived therefrom, and the right to vote on any propriety or other interest, on any shares of the capital stock and upon any bonds, debentures, or other securities having voting power, so owned or held; and that the corporation shall not engage in the business of an open-end or close-end investment company as defined in the Investment Company Act (Republic Act No. 2629), without first complying with the applicable provisions of said Act nor shall it act as broker or dealer in securities. HSAcaE\n\nIt is likewise represented that SMMPH is One Hundred percent (100%) owned by Sumitomo Metal Mining Co.,Ltd. of Japan (\"SMM\"),a corporation organized and existing under and by virtue of the laws of Japan.\n\nIt is further represented that SMM is a publicly-held company listed in the Tokyo Stock Exchange; that its stocks are owned and held by more than twenty (20) corporate and individual stockholders; and that as of 31 March 2019, the twenty (20) major shareholders of SMM own only 42.833% of its capital stock.\n\nIn reply thereto, please be informed that Section 29 (A) and (B) (2) (a) of the Tax Code on the imposition of IAET, states that:\n\n\"SEC. 29. Imposition of Improperly Accumulated Earnings Tax. \u2014\n\n\"(A) In General. \u2014 In addition to other taxes imposed by this Title, there is hereby imposed for each taxable year on the improperly accumulated taxable income of each corporation described in Subsection B hereof, an improperly accumulated earnings tax equal to ten percent (10%) of the improperly accumulated taxable income.\n\n(B) Tax on Corporations Subject to Improperly Accumulated Earnings Tax. \u2014\n\n(1) In General. \u2014 The improperly accumulated earnings tax imposed in the preceding Section shall apply to every corporation formed or availed for the purpose of avoiding the income tax with respect to its shareholders or the shareholders of any other corporation, by permitting earnings and profits to accumulate instead of being divided or distributed.\n\n(2) Exceptions. \u2014 The improperly accumulated earnings tax as provided for under this Section shall not apply to:\n\n(a) Publicly-held corporations;\n\n(b) Banks and other non-bank financial intermediaries; and\n\n(c) Insurance companies.\" (Emphasis supplied)\n\nThis kind of tax is being imposed in the nature of a penalty to the corporation for the improper accumulation of its earnings, as a form of deterrent to the avoidance of tax upon shareholders who are supposed to pay dividends tax on the earnings distributed to them by the corporation. However, the IAET shall not apply to, among others, publicly-held corporations.\n\nFurthermore, Section 4 of RR No. 2-2001, \"Implementing the Provision on Improperly Accumulated Earnings Tax under Section 29 of the Tax Code of 1997, provides:\n\n\"For purposes of these Regulations, closely-held corporations are those corporations at least fifty-percent (50%) in value of the outstanding capital stock or at least fifty percent (50%) of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote is owned directly or indirectly by or for not more than twenty (20) individuals. Domestic corporations not falling under the aforesaid definition are, therefore, publicly-held corporations.\"\n\nFor purposes of determining whether the corporation is a closely-held corporation, it is provided that stock owned directly or indirectly by or for a corporation, partnership, estate or trust shall be considered as being owned proportionately by its shareholders, partners or beneficiaries. HESIcT\n\nThus, in BIR Ruling No. 025-2002 dated June 25, 2002, this Office ruled that such shares will be considered as being owned proportionately by the shareholders. The ownership of a domestic corporation for purposes of determining whether it is closely-held corporation or a publicly-held corporation is ultimately traced to the individual shareholders of the parent company. Accordingly, where at least fifty percent (50%) of the outstanding capital or at least fifty percent (50%) of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote in a corporation is owned directly or indirectly by at least 21 or more individuals, the corporation is considered publicly-held corporation as the term is defined in RR No. 2-2001.\n\nFurthermore, in BIR Ruling No. 094-2013 dated March 18, 2013,this Office also ruled that to determine whether a corporation is publicly-held or not, the ownership of the domestic corporation must be ultimately traced to the individual shareholders of the parent company. In the aforesaid BIR Ruling, the corporation involved was owned by another corporation which is wholly owned by the parent corporation. In resolving whether the corporation is a publicly-held corporation or not, this Office ultimately traced the shareholdings of the individual shareholders of the parent company.\n\nSuch being the case, the ownership of a domestic corporation (like SMMPH) for purposes of determining whether it is a closely-held corporation or a publicly-held corporation is ultimately traced to the individual shareholders of the parent-company. Since SMMPH is one hundred (100%) owned by SMM, SMMPH shall be considered as being owned by SMM's shareholders. Since SMM is a corporation where at least fifty percent (50%) of the outstanding capital stock or at least fifty percent (50%) of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote is owned directly or indirectly by more than twenty (20) individuals, SMMPH is considered publicly-held corporation as the term is defined in RR No. 2-2001.\n\nIn view of the foregoing, this Office holds that SMMPH is considered a publicly-held corporation, and therefore, is exempt from the imposition of IAET under Section 29 (B) (2) (a) of the Tax Code, as amended.\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be disclosed that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and avoid.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R. DULAY\nCommissioner of Internal Revenue",

It is your position that such transfer will neither result in a taxable gain profit pursuant to Section 40 (C) (2) of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997 (Tax Code), as amended.\n\nIt appears that Dreftad Properties, Inc. is a corporation duly organized and existing under Philippine laws with principal office address at Lot 33, Block 1, Insular Village, Vicente Hizon, Davao City, Davao del Sur. It has an authorized capital stock consisting of Eighteen Thousand (18,000) shares with par value of _______________ Pesos (P________) per share, all of which are issued and outstanding. Out of the issued and outstanding shares of stocks, 4,320 shares were subscribed by AAA, one of the incorporators of Dreftad Properties, Inc. and sole owner of a parcel of land located at Lot 33, Block 1, Insular Village, Barangay Vicente Hizon, Davao City with Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. ________.\n\nOn April 12, 2017, a \"Deed of Assignment\" was executed by AAA for the assignment of TCT No. ________ in favor of Dreftad Properties, Inc. in compliance with her covenant to transfer the said properly in exchange for the 4,320 shares of stock that she subscribed.\n\nThe capital and shareholding structure of Dreftad Properties, Inc. as indicated in the Articles of Incorporated is shown below: EcTCAD\n\nIncorporator's Name\n\nNo. of Shares Subscribed\n\nAmount Subscribed (Php)\n\nPaid\n\nPercentage Ownership\n\nAAA\n\n4,320\n\n___________\n\n___________\n\n24%\n\nCCC\n\n4,320\n\n___________\n\n___________\n\n24%\n\nDDD\n\n4,320\n\n___________\n\n___________\n\n24%\n\nEEE\n\n4,320\n\n___________\n\n___________\n\n24%\n\nBBB\n\n720\n\n___________\n\n___________\n\n4%\n\nTOTAL\n\n18,000\n\n___________\n\n___________\n\n100%\n\nIn reply, please be informed that pursuant to Section 40 (C) (2) and (6) (c) of the Tax Code, as amended, no gain or loss shall be recognized if property is transferred to a corporation by a person, in exchange for stock in such a corporation of which as result of such exchange, said person, alone or together with others, not exceeding four persons, gains control of said corporation. The term \"control\" shall mean ownership of stocks in a corporation possessing at least 51% of the total voting power of all classes of stocks entitled to vote. Control is determined by the amount of stocks received i.e.,total subscribed by the transferors. In determining the 51% stock ownership, only those persons who transferred property for stocks in the same transaction may be counted up to a maximum of five.\n\nAAA, however, did not gain control of the transferee corporation since she only owns 24% of the company's total voting stocks. Consequently, gain or loss shall be recognized on her assignment/transfer of property in exchange for shares of stock of Dreftad Properties, Inc.\n\nIn view of the foregoing, this Office is of the opinion and hereby holds as follows:\n\na. The assignment of the real property by AAA does not qualify as a tax-free exchange under Section 40 (C) (2) of the Tax Code, as amended, hence, the gain or loss shall be recognized on such transaction under Section 39 and 40 (A). Capital gains tax as imposed by Section 24 (D) (1) of the same Tax Code shall be due from the transferor;\n\nb. Likewise, on the transfer of real properties, transferor shall be liable for documentary stamp tax under Section 196 of the Tax Code, as amended, based on the higher of: (i) the consideration contracted to be paid for such real property, and (ii) the fair market value as determined in accordance with Section 6 (E) of the same Tax Code;\n\nc. The original issuance of shares of Dreftad Properties, Inc. subscribed by AAA shall also be subject to documentary stamp tax imposed by Section 175 of the Tax Code, as amended; and\n\nd. AAA is not subject to Value-Added Tax (VAT) on the transfer of her residential property as it appears that the subject property is a capital asset.

(RCBN) to the Reverend Father Superior of the Order of Friars Minor Conventuals (OFMConv) is exempt from capital gains tax on the basis of Section 24 (D) (2) of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997 (1997 Tax Code), as amended.\n\nAs represented, RCBN is a religious organization duly organized and existing in accordance with the laws of the Philippines with principal address at St. Peter Parish, New Capitol Estates I, Commonwealth Ave.,Quezon City. It is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under SEC Registration No. CN200305075 on March 4, 2003 as a corporation sole.\n\nLikewise, Reverend Father Superior of the OFMConv is a religious corporation sole duly organized and existing in accordance with the laws of the Philippines with principal address at 32 John Paul St.,Multinational Village, Moonwalk, Para\u00f1aque City.\n\nOn July 7, 2017, a Deed of Absolute Sale was executed by and between RCBN and OFMConv whereby the former conveyed a parcel of land situated in Novaliches, Quezon City, identified as Lot 13, PCS-04-000420, with an area of 3,000 sq. m.,more or less, covered by Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. __________ of the Registry of Deeds of Quezon City (\"Subject Property\") in consideration of the sum of ______________.\n\nThe said proceeds deposited in Metro Bank Fairview Regalado branch under the account of RCBN-BAHAY PARI shall be used for the funding of the construction of the Novaliches Clergy Retreat and Retirement Home located at Visitation Parish, Sacred Heart Village, Novaliches, Quezon City. The building will be the primary residence of the retired Priest of RCBN.\n\nIn reply, please be informed that Section 24 (D) (2) of the 1997 Tax Code, as amended, provides:\n\n\"SEC. 24. Income Tax Rates.\u2014\n\n(D) Capital Gains from Sale of Real Property.\u2014\n\n(2) Exception. [1] \u2014 The provisions of paragraph (1) of this Subsection to the contrary notwithstanding, capital gains presumed to have been realized from the sale or disposition of their principal residence by natural persons,the proceeds of which is fully utilized in acquiring or constructing a new principal residence within eighteen (18) calendar months from the date of sale or disposition, shall be exempt from the capital gains tax imposed under this Subsection ...\"\n\nIn relation thereto, Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 13-99, as amended, implementing Section 24 (D) (2) of the 1997 Tax Code, as amended, defines \"natural person\" to mean:\n\n\"(1) 'Natural person.' \u2014 shall refer to a citizen or resident alien individual taxable under Sec. 24 of the Code. It does not include an estate or a trust,the provision of Sec. 60 of the Code to the contrary notwithstanding.\"\n\nDocuments show that RCBN is a corporation sole. Under Section 109 of the Corporation Code of the Philippines or Batas Pambansa Blg. 68, a corporation sole is considered as a trustee of the properties of the church:\n\n\"Sec. 110. Corporation sole. \u2014 For the purpose of administering and managing, as trustee,the affairs, property and temporalities of any religious denomination, sect or church, a corporation sole may be formed by the chief archbishop, bishop, priest, minister, rabbi or other presiding elder of such religious denomination, sect or church.\"\n\nThe case of The Roman Catholic Administrator of Davao, Inc. vs. The Land Registration Commission and The Register of Deeds of Davao City, G.R. No. L-8451, December 20, 1957 explains the doctrine of \"corporation sole\" as follows:\n\n\"A corporation sole consists of one person only, and his successors (who will always be one at a time),in some particular station, who are incorporated by law in order to give them some legal capacities and advantages, particularly that of perpetuity, which in their natural persons they could not have had.In this sense, the king is a sole corporation; so is a bishop, or dens, distinct from their several chapters (Reid vs. Barry, 93 Fla. 849, 112 So. 8416).x x x\n\nThat leaves no room for doubt that the bishops or archbishops, as the case may be, as corporations sole are merely administrators of the church properties that come to their possession, in which they hold in trust for the church.It can also be said that while it is true that church properties could be administered by natural persons, problems regarding succession to said properties can not be avoided to rise upon his death. Through this legal fiction, however, church properties acquired by the incumbent of a corporation sole pass, by operation of law, upon his death not his personal heirs but to his successor in office. It could be seen, therefore, that a corporation sole is created not only to administer the temporalities of the church or religious society where he belongs but also to hold and transmit the same to his successor in said office. x x x\"\n\nTherefore, although RCBN consists of the Bishop of Novaliches, it is not considered a \"natural person\" within the ambit of Section 24 (D) (2) of the 1997 Tax Code, as amended. Not being a natural person, RCBN is not qualified to avail of the tax exemption provided under Section 24 (D) (2) of the 1997 Tax Code, as amended.\n\nIt bears stressing that tax exemptions are construed in strictissimi juris against the taxpayer and liberally in favor of the taxing authority. The basic principle in the construction of laws granting tax exemptions has been very stable. He who claims an exemption from his share of the common burden of taxation must justify his claim by showing that the Legislature intended to exempt him by words too plain to be beyond doubt or mistake (City of Iloilo, et al. vs. Smart Communications, Inc.,G.R. No. 167260, dated February 27, 2009).\n\nIN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING, your request for tax exemption of the sale of a parcel of land by RCBN to OFMConv is hereby denied for lack of legal basis.\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be ascertained that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R. DULAY\nCommissioner of Internal Revenue\n\n1.See RR 13-99 (July 26, 1999) as amended by RR 14-2000 (November 20, 2000) and RR 17-2003 (March 31, 2003) for implementing guidelines on the tax exemption of sale of principal residence.",

Gil Puyat Ave.\nSan Antonio Village, Makati City\n\nAttention: AAA\n_______________\n\nGentlemen :\n\nThis refers to your letter dated April 27, 2018 requesting on behalf of BIO SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH LABORATORIES (I) PVT. LTD. (the \"Company\") for a confirmation of your opinion that the service fees to be received by the Company in connection with its delivery of services to Ajanta Pharma Philippines, Inc. (\"Ajanta\") are exempt from Philippine income tax, and consequently, from withholding tax.\n\nDocuments show that the Company is a corporation organized and existing under the laws of India with principal office at Plot No. 106/3, besides Aries Pharmaceuticals, Opp. Golden Chemicals, S.V. Road, Mira Road, Thane, Maharastra, India. It is not registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to engage in business in the Philippines.\n\nOn the other hand, Ajanta is a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the Philippines with office address at 710 AXA Life Center, 1286 Sen. Gil Puyat Ave.,San Antonio Village, Makati City, Metro Manila. It is engaged in the business of distributing, on a wholesale bases, pharmaceutical products. As part of the process for securing marketing authorizations with the Philippine Food and Drug Administration (\"PFDA\") Ajanta is required under PFDA Circular 2015-012 to perform bioequivalence studies for its new pharmaceutical products and/or existing pharmaceutical products requiring renewal (\"Bioequivalence Studies\").\n\nOn April 21, 2018, the Company and Ajanta entered into a Bioequivalent Agreement (\"Agreement\") whereby the Company will provide Bioequivalence Studies for Ajanta. The Company will perform the Bioequivalence Studies in Maharastra, India and the Bioequivalence Report will be sent to Ajanta in the Philippines.\n\nIn reply, please be informed that Sections 23 (F) and 28 (B) (1) of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended (Tax Code) by Republic Act No. 9337 provide: EcTCAD\n\n\"SECTION 23. General Principles of Income Taxation in the Philippines.\u2014 Except when otherwise provided in this Code:\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(F) A foreign corporation, whether engaged or not in trade or business in the Philippines, is taxable only on income derived from sources within the Philippines.\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\nSECTION 28. Rates of Income Tax on Foreign Corporations. \u2014\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(B) Tax on Nonresident Foreign Corporation. \u2014\n\n(1) In General. \u2014 Except as otherwise provided in this Code, a foreign corporation not engaged in trade or business in the Philippines shall pay a tax equal to thirty-five percent (35%) of the gross income received during each taxable year from all sources within the Philippines,such as interests, dividends, rents, royalties, salaries, premiums (except reinsurance premiums),annuities, emoluments or other fixed or determinable annual, periodic or casual gains, profits and income, and capital gains, except capital gains subject to tax under subparagraph 5 (c):Provided, That effective January 1, 2009, the rate of income tax shall be thirty percent (30%).\"\n\nOn the other hand, Section 42 (C) (3),supra states:\n\n\"SECTION 42. Income from Sources within the Philippines. \u2014\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(C) Gross Income from Sources without the Philippines. \u2014 The following items of gross income shall be treated as income from sources without the Philippines:\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(3) Compensation for labor or personal services performed without the Philippines;\"\n\nPursuant to the above provisions, non-resident foreign corporations are subject to income tax only on income derived from all sources within the Philippines. Conversely, these corporations are not subject to income tax on income derived from sources outside the Philippines.\n\nFurther, Section 42 (C) (3) of the same Tax Code provides that personal services performed without the Philippines are considered income from sources without the Philippines. Hence, non-resident foreign corporations deriving income for services performed abroad are not subject to Philippine income tax since such services are considered income from sources without the Philippines.\n\nThis Office explained the above provisions in BIR Ruling No. 212-12 dated March 23, 2012, citing CIR vs. British Overseas Airways Corporation,G.R. Nos. 65773-74, April 30, 1987 and CIR vs. Japan Airlines, Inc., G.R. No. 60714, March 6, 1991:\n\n\"The situs of tax for services is the place where the service is rendered. Under the Philippine source of income rules for income tax purposes, service income will be considered Philippine source income only if the services are rendered in the Philippines. Conversely, if the services are rendered outside the Philippines, the service income will be considered as foreign source income. x x x\n\n\"The rule in this jurisdiction regarding tax situs is: the source of an income is the property, activity or service that produced the income; the test of taxability is the source, and the source of an income is that activity which produced the income (CIR v. British Overseas Airways Corporation, G.R. Nos. 65773-74, April 30, 1987). Stated differently, the situs of the income derived from labor or personal services is determined solely by the place where service is rendered (CIR v. Japan Airlines, Inc., G.R. No. 60714, March 6, 1991). Compensation from services performed abroad is, therefore, considered income from sources without the Philippines and thus not subject to Philippine income tax.\"\n\nMoreover, Section 2.57.1 (I) (1) of Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 2-98, as amended, provides that non-resident foreign corporations are subject to final withholding tax only on their income derived from all sources within the Philippines.\n\nIN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, this Office hereby CONFIRMS your opinion that the income payment made by Ajanta Pharma Philippines, Inc. to Bio Scientific Research Laboratories (I) PVT. LTD. for services rendered abroad or outside the Philippines is NOT subject to Philippine income tax and consequently to withholding tax.\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be disclosed that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R.

It is engaged in the business of remittance, transferring or transmitting money on behalf of any person to another person and/or entity, otherwise referred to as Money Transfer Service transaction. To offer and facilitate a Money Transfer Services transaction to its clients, PETNET, Inc. accesses Western Union's global IT platform where it can connect with its global network of agents to facilitate the various phases of a Money Transfer Service transaction.\n\nTo broaden the reach of its pay-out transactions with the use of the Western Union's global IT platform, PETNET, Inc. entered into agreements with several other entities such as LBC. Pursuant to the arrangement between PETNET, Inc. and LBC, the latter's branches act as a physical service station for Money Transfer Service transactions, specifically as regards the pay-out of funds. To enable LBC to perform such services, both parties ensure Application Programming Interface integration through the PETNET server. HEITAD\n\nThrough the Application Programming Interface, PETNET, Inc. provides each LBC branch access to the Western Union's global IT platform through PETNET, Inc.'s virtual private network (VPN) connection. The VPN connection acts as a gateway, through which the LBC server request details of the transaction from the server of PETNET, Inc. The server of PETNET, Inc., in turn, request transaction details from the Western Union's global IT platform. Upon receipt of transaction details, server of PETNET, Inc. communicates the information to the LBC server. With the transaction details, LBC renders services as payout/sending/servicing stations to PETNET, Inc., and thus acts as a front-liner to customers of the Money Transfer Service transactions.\n\nIn exchange for LBC's service consisting of request of transaction details and acting as physical service stations, PETNET, Inc. pays fees to LBC. LBC, meanwhile, issues official receipts under its own name to customers of the Money Transfer Service transactions.\n\nIn view of the foregoing, you now request for confirmation that the service fees payable by PETNET, Inc. to LBC are subject to two percent (2%) EWT.\n\nIn reply thereto, please be informed that Section 2.57.2 (I) of Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 2-98, as amended, provides that:\n\n\"SECTION 2.57.2. Income Payments Subject to Creditable Withholding Tax and Rates Prescribed Thereon. \u2014 Except as herein otherwise provided, there shall be withheld a creditable income tax at the rates herein specified for each class of payee from the following items of income payments to persons residing in the Philippines:\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(I) Income payment made by top withholding agents, either private corporations or individuals, to their local/resident supplier of goods and local/resident supplier of services other than those covered by other rates of withholding tax. [formerly under letters (M) and (W)] \u2014 Income payments made by any of the top withholding agents, as determined by the Commissioner, to their local/resident supplier of goods/services, including non-resident aliens engaged in trade or business in the Philippines, shall be subjected to the following withholding tax rates:\n\nSupplier of goods \u2014 One percent (1%)\n\nSupplier of services \u2014 Two percent (2%)\n\nTop withholding agents shall include the following:\n\na. Classified and duly notified by the Commissioner as either any of the following unless previously de-classified as such or had already ceased business operations:\n\n(1) A large taxpayer under Revenue Regulations No. 1-98, as amended;\n\n(2) Top twenty thousand (20,000) private corporations under RR No. 6-2009; or\n\n(3) Top five thousand (5,000) individuals under RR No. 6-2009;\n\nb. Taxpayers identified and included as Medium Taxpayers, and those under the Taxpayer Account Management Program (TAMP).\n\nThe top withholding agents by concerned LTS/RRs/RDOs shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation. It may also be posted in the BIR website. These shall serve as the \"notice\" to the top withholding agents. The obligation to withhold under this sub-section shall commence on the first (1st) day of the month following the month of publication. Existing withholding agents classified as large taxpayers, top 20,000 private corporations or top 5,000 individuals which have not been delisted prior to these regulations shall remain as top withholding agents. The initial and succeeding publications shall include the additional top withholding agents and those that are delisted. ATICcS\n\nThe term \"goods\" pertains to tangible personal property. It does not include intangible personal property, as well as agricultural products which are defined under item (N) of this Section.\n\nThe term \"local resident suppliers of goods/suppliers of services\" pertains to a supplier from whom any of the top withholding agents, regularly makes its purchases of goods/services. As a general rule, this term does not include a casual purchase of goods/services that is purchase made from a non-regular supplier and oftentimes involving a single purchase. However, a single purchase which involves Ten thousand pesos (P10,000) or more shall be subject to withholding tax under this subsection. The term \"regular suppliers,\" for purposes of these regulations, refer to suppliers who are engaged in business or exercise of profession/calling with whom the taxpayer-buyer has transacted at least six (6) transactions, regardless of amount per transaction, either in the previous year or current year.\"\n\nPrescinding from the above-cited provisions of RR No. 2-98, as amended, it is undisputed that income payments made by any of the top withholding agents, as determined by the Commissioner, to their local/resident supplier of goods/services, including non-resident aliens engaged in trade or business in the Philippines, shall be subject to one percent (1%) EWT for sale of goods and/or two percent (2%) EWT for sale of services.\n\nIn stressing the rationale of the above-cited principles, this Office had elucidated the matter in BIR Ruling No. 019-2005 dated September 21, 2005 as follows:\n\n\". . . in order that income payments to the SME/Supplier will be subject to the 1% or 2% creditable withholding tax (CWT), as the case may be, Big Brother must be among the top ten thousand (10,000) private corporations, as determined by the Commissioner, and has transacted at least six (6) transactions with the SME/Supplier, regardless of the amount per transaction, either in the previous year or current year (BIR Ruling No. 141-94 dated September 20, 1994). Thus, under Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 28-94, a taxpayer will be subject to the withholding provisions when he receives a notice that he is included in the list of the top 10,000 corporations (BIR Ruling No. 166-94 dated December 5, 1994). Accordingly, Big Brother shall be constituted as withholding agent of its suppliers, the SME/Suppliers.\"\n\nAccordingly, since PETNET, Inc. has been classified and notified by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue on December 15, 2008 as one of the top twenty thousand (20,000) private corporations, service fees payable by PETNET, Inc. to LBC are subject to two percent (2%) EWT pursuant to Section 2.57.2 (I) of RR No. 2-98, as amended.\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be disclosed that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void. TIADCc\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R.

(DMC-UPDI) is not subject to Capital Gains Tax (CGT) imposed under Section 24 (D) (1) of the National Internal Revenue Code (\"Tax Code\") of 1997, as amended and Documentary Stamp Tax (DST) under Section 196 of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended.\n\nIt is represented that Magallanes Residence Condominium is composed of three buildings, namely, Valencia, Barcelona and Toledo. On October 2019, Davao City suffered from a series of earthquakes. Due to substantial structural damages, the Office of the City Building Official of Davao City declared that Valencia and Barcelona buildings were unfit for occupancy. Other projects by DMC-UPDI in Davao City also suffered considerable structural damage. On December 15, 2019, Davao City suffered from a stronger earthquake and the Toledo building was also \"red-tagged\" due to major structural cracks on the beams and slabs.\n\nDue to this, unit owners of Magallanes Residences Condominium went into a series of negotiations with DMC-UPDI. Eventually, DMC-UPDI agreed to enter into a buy-back transaction with the aforesaid unit owners whereas DMC-UPDI will purchase back the condominium units from their owners at 125% of the total contract price by which the unit owners had purchased the aforesaid units.\n\nDue to the fear of the possible dangers that may befall you if you continue to live in a building which is structurally compromised, you accepted the offer from DMC-UPDI to purchase back from you your condominium unit.\n\nThus, in order to help diminish any further costs that you may incur, you seek confirmation that the aforesaid buy-back transactions are exempted from CGT and DST.\n\nIn reply, please be informed that Section 24 (D) (1) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, provides: CAIHTE\n\n\"Sec. 24.

Thus, the subject transaction is subject to CGT regardless of whether a gain was in fact realized considering that Section 24 (D) (1) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, imposes CGT upon capital gains which is presumed to have been realized.\n\nAlso, the buy-back transaction, being a disposition of real property under Section 24 (D) (1) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, is likewise subject to the documentary stamp taxes imposed in Section 188 and Section 196 of the same Code.\n\nAs repeatedly held by the Supreme Court, \"laws granting exemption from tax are construed scrictissimi juris against the taxpayer and liberally in favor of the taxing power. Taxation is the rule and exemption is the exception. The law does not look with favor on tax exemptions and that he who would seek to be thus privileged must justify it by words too plain to be mistaken and too categorical to be misinterpreted.\" [1]\n\nPlease be guided accordingly.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.)

On September 23, 2001, CCC, married to DDD (\"Sps. CCDD\"),executed a Deed of Absolute Sale in favor of EEE, married to FFF, (\"Sps.

On October 30, 2007 and January 17, 2008, Sps. EEFF mortgaged the Subject Properties in favor of Fil-Agro Rural Bank, Inc. (\"the Bank\"),a domestic corporation duly organized and existing under and by virtue of Philippine laws, with principal office and business address at McArthur Hi-way, Poblacion II, Marilao, Bulacan.\n\n3.

On May 26, 2014, the Bank executed a Contract to Sell for the sale of the Subject Properties on installments in your favor in the amount of _________.\n\n5. Sps.

On September 25, 2014, the Monetary Board (MB) of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) ordered the closure of the Bank pursuant to MB Resolution No. 1486.\n\n7. Sps. EEFF have fully paid the purchase price.\n\n8. The BIR Revenue District Office (RDO) No. 25B-Sta. Maria, Bulacan, assessed you the amount of ____________________ Pesos (P___________).\n\nIn reply, please be informed that Section 204 (B) (1) and (2) of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended (Tax Code), provides:\n\n\"Sec. 204. Authority of the Commissioner to Compromise, Abate and Refund or Credit Taxes. \u2014 The Commissioner may \u2014\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(B) Abate or cancel a tax liability, when:\n\n(1) The tax or any portion thereof appears to be unjustly or excessively assessed; or\n\n(2) The administration and collection costs involved do not justify the collection of the amount due.\"\n\nIt is noted that you failed to cite the ground by which you invoke the power of the Commissioner to waive the penalties and interest on the late payment of applicable taxes on the aforementioned transfers.\n\nUnder Sections 248 and 249, both of the Tax Code, the imposition of the surcharge and interest on delinquency is mandatory. Strong reasons of policy support a strict observance of the rule regarding the payment of tax. The laws imposing penalties for delinquencies are clearly intended to hasten tax payments or punish evasions or neglect of duty in respect thereof. If delays in tax payments are to be condoned for light reasons, the law imposing penalties for delinquencies would be rendered nugatory and the maintenance of the government and its multifarious activities would be as precarious as taxpayers are willing or unwilling to pay their obligations to the state on time. (Jamora vs. Meer,74 Phil. 22)\n\nIn view of the foregoing, this Office hereby regrets to deny your request of waiver of the imposition of penalties and interest for lack of legal basis.

Imposition of Improperly Accumulated Earnings Tax. \u2014\n\n(A) In General. \u2014 In addition to other taxes imposed by this Title, there is hereby imposed for each taxable year on the improperly accumulated taxable income of each corporation described in Subsection B hereof, an improperly accumulated earnings tax equal to ten percent (10%) of the improperly accumulated taxable income.\n\n(B) Tax on Corporations Subject to Improperly Accumulated Earning Tax. \u2014\n\n(1) In General. \u2014 The improperly accumulated earning tax imposed in the preceding Section shall apply to every corporation formed or availed for the purpose of avoiding the income tax with respect to its shareholders or the shareholders of any other corporation, by permitting earnings and profits to accumulate instead of being divided or distributed.\n\n(2) Exceptions. \u2014 The improperly accumulated earnings tax as provided for under this Section shall not apply to:\n\n(a) Publicly-held corporations;\n\n(b) Banks and other non-bank financial intermediaries; and\n\n(c) Insurance companies.\" (Emphasis supplied)\n\nThis kind of tax is being imposed in the nature of a penalty to a corporation for the improper accumulation of its earnings, as a form of deterrent to the avoidance of tax upon shareholders who are supposed to pay dividends tax on the earnings distributed to them by the corporation. However, the IAET shall not apply, among others, to publicly-held corporations.\n\nFurthermore, Section 4 of RR No. 02-2001 [1] dated February 12, 2001 provides that:\n\n\"For purposes of these Regulations, closely-held corporations are those corporations at least fifty-percent (50%) in value of the outstanding capital stock or at least fifty percent (50%) of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote is owned directly or indirectly by or for not more than twenty (20) individuals. Domestic corporations not falling under the aforesaid definition are, therefore, publicly-held corporations.\"\n\nFor purposes of determining whether the corporation is a closely-held corporation, it is provided that stock owned directly or indirectly by or for a corporation, partnership, estate or trust shall be considered as being owned proportionately by its shareholders, partners or beneficiaries.\n\nThus, in BIR Ruling No. 025-2002 dated June 25, 2002, this Office ruled that such shares will be considered as being owned proportionately by the shareholders. The ownership of a domestic corporation for purposes of determining whether it is closely-held corporation or a publicly-held corporation is ultimately traced to the individual shareholders of the parent company. Accordingly, where at least 50% of the outstanding capital or at least 50% of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote in a corporation is owned directly or indirectly by at least 21 or more individuals, the corporation is considered publicly-held corporation as the term is defined in RR No. 02-2001.\n\nFurthermore, in BIR Ruling No. 094-2013 dated March 18, 2013,this Office also ruled that to determine whether a corporation is publicly-held or not, is to ultimately trace to the individual shareholders of the parent company. In this BIR Ruling, the corporation involved was owned by another corporation which is wholly owned by the parent corporation. In resolving whether the corporation is a publicly-held corporation or not, this office ultimately traced the shareholdings of the individual shareholders of the parent company. acEHCD\n\nSuch being the case, the ownership of a domestic corporation (like ACPI),for purposes of determining whether it is a closely-held corporation or a publicly-held corporation, is ultimately traced to the individual shareholders of the parent-company. Since ACPI is 100% owned by Atlas Copco AB, it shall be considered as being owned by Atlas Copco AB's shareholders.\n\nIn applying the foregoing principle, this Office holds that ACPI is exempt from the imposition of IAET considering that the shares of ACPI are 100% owned by Atlas Copco AB, a corporation where at least fifty percent (50%) of the outstanding capital stock or at least 50% of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote is owned directly or indirectly by more than twenty (20) individuals; hence, a publicly-held corporation as defined in RR No. 02-2001.\n\nIn view of the foregoing, this Office holds that ACPI is considered a publicly-held corporation, and therefore, exempt from the imposition of IAET under Section 29 (B) (2) (a) of the NIRC of 1997, as amended.\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be disclosed that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and avoid.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R.

In addition, the tax-exempt joint venture or consortium as herein defined shall not include those who are mere suppliers of goods, services or capital to a construction project.\n\nThe members to a Joint Venture not taxable as corporation shall each be responsible in reporting and paying appropriate income taxes on their respective share to the joint ventures profit.\"\n\nSuch being the case, the Qingdao Municipal Construction/ESR Construction-Joint Venture formed for the purpose of undertaking the PR-13, Siay-Gapol Road, Zamboanga Sibugay, under ADB Loan No. 3631-PHI: Improving Growth Corridors in Mindanao Road Sector Project (IGCMRSP),with Contract Identification No. 19Z00014 is considered a joint venture not taxable as a corporation for complying with the conditions provided in RR No. 10-2012, i.e., (1) the Joint Venture is for the undertaking of construction project; (2) the Joint Venture involves joining or pooling of resources by licensed local contractors (licensed as general contractor by the PCAB); (3) the local contractors are engaged in construction business; and (4) the Joint Venture itself is duly licensed by PCAB; and therefore not subject to the corporate income tax under Section 27 (A) of the Tax Code, as amended.

Thus, before Qingdao Municipal Construction/ESR Construction-Joint Venture distributes the net income to the co-venturers, pursuant to their agreed profits/income sharing, it shall withhold the tax based on the net income of its co-venturers and remit the same to the BIR. (BIR Ruling No. 1421-18 dated December 7, 2018)\n\nFinally, the co-venturers are required to enroll themselves to the Bureau of Internal Revenue's Electronic Filing and Payment System (eFPS).The enrollment should be done at the Revenue District Office (RDO) where they are registered as taxpayers.

                                    "Details": "Article 1475 of the New Civil Code; RR No. 16-05; RR No. 16-11; and RR No. 03-12\n\nSM Development Corporation\n10th Floor, One E-Com Center, Harbor Drive\nMall of Asia Complex, CBP-IA\nPasay City\n\nAttention: AAA\n\nGentlemen :\n\nThis refers to your request on behalf of SM Development Corporation (\"SMDC\") for clarification on the application of BIR Ruling No. 815-2018 dated May 15, 2018.\n\nBackground:\n\nOn April 2, 2012, a Contract to Sell was executed by and between Spouses BBB and SMDC over one (1) condominium unit more particularly described as Unit No. 0829-D situated at the Jazz Residences in Makati City. The gross selling price for the condominium unit is pegged at PhP2,900,000. However, after applying the discount, the net selling price is reduced to PhP2,755,000.\n\nBased on the above representation, this Office issued BIR Ruling No. 815-2018 on May 15, 2018 stating that the purchase of the said condominium unit is exempt from value-added tax (VAT) since its selling price of PhP2,755,000.00 did not exceed the revised VAT threshold of PhP3,199,200.00 pursuant to Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 16-2011 dated October 27, 2011 which took effect on January 1, 2012.\n\nHowever, in your letter dated August 30, 2017, you narrated that while it was only on April 2, 2012 when the parties executed and notarized the Contract to Sell over the said condominium unit, Spouses BBB and SMDC entered into a Reservation Agreement on June 30, 2011. In view thereof, Spouses BBB started paying their monthly installments due to SMDC on July 30, 2011.\n\nAt the time SMDC began receiving the installment payments from Spouses BBB, RR No. 16-2005, as amended, mandated the imposition of VAT on the sale of residential condominium units with selling prices above PhP2,500,000.00. As such, the installment payments of Spouses BBB were subjected to VAT. CAIHTE\n\nOn January 1, 2012, RR No. 16-2011 which increased the VAT exemption threshold for sales of residential condominium units to PhP3,199,200.00 became effective. Thus, beginning January 1, 2012, all sales of residential condominium units with price not exceeding PhP3,199,200.00 became exempt from VAT.\n\nConsidering that Spouses BBB commenced payment of their installments due for the above-mentioned residential condominium unit, although the Contract to Sell was belatedly executed on April 2, 2012 when RR No. 16-2011 had already taken effect, you now request for clarification on how SMDC will put into effect the VAT exemption on the sale of condominium unit to Spouses BBB as provided in BIR Ruling No. 815-2018. [n]\n\nIn reply, please be informed that Article 1475 of the New Civil Code provides that:\n\n\"Article 1475. The contract of sale is perfected at the moment there is a meeting of minds upon the thing which is the object of the contract and upon the price.\n\nFrom that moment, the parties may reciprocally demand performance, subject to the provisions of the law governing the form of contracts.\"\n\nThe stages of a contract of sale are: (1) negotiation, covering the period from the time the prospective contracting parties indicate interest in the contract to the time the contract is perfected; (2) perfection, which takes place upon the concurrence of the essential elements of the sale, which is the meeting of the minds of the parties as to the object of the contract and upon the price; and (3) consummation, which begins when the parties perform their respective undertakings under the contract of sale, culminating in the extinguishment thereof. [1]\n\nBased on the above-quoted provision and principle of law in relation to the factual antecedents of this case, it is clear that Spouses BBB and SMDC perfected their contract of sale on June 30, 2011, the time of the execution of the Reservation Agreement, and was consummated on July 30, 2011, the time when Spouses BBB started paying their monthly installments due to SMDC.\n\nMoreover, Article 1403 (2) (e) of the New Civil Code dictates that:\n\n\"Art. 1403. The following contracts are unenforceable, unless they are ratified:\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(2) Those that do not comply with the Statute of Frauds as set forth in this number. In the following cases an agreement hereafter made shall be unenforceable by action, unless the same, or some note or memorandum, thereof, be in writing, and subscribed by the party charged, or by his agent; evidence, therefore, of the agreement cannot be received without the writing, or a secondary evidence of its contents:\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(e) An agreement of the leasing for a longer period than one year, or for the sale of real property or of an interest therein;\" (Emphasis and underscoring supplied) DETACa\n\nIn the case of Swedish Match v. Court of Appeals, [2] the Supreme Court through Justice Tinga, discussed, to wit:\n\n\"The Statute of Frauds embodied in Article 1403, paragraph (2), of the Civil Code requires certain contracts enumerated therein to be evidenced by some note or memorandum in order to be enforceable. The term \"Statute of Frauds\" is descriptive of statutes which require certain classes of contracts to be in writing. The Statute does not deprive the parties of the right to contract with respect to the matters therein involved, but merely regulates the formalities of the contract necessary to render it enforceable. Evidence of the agreement cannot be received without the writing or a secondary evidence of its contents.\n\nThe Statute, however, simply provides the method by which the contracts enumerated therein may be proved but does not declare them invalid because they are not reduced to writing. By law, contracts are obligatory in whatever form they may have been entered into, provided all the essential requisites for their validity are present. However, when the law requires that a contract be in some form in order that it may be valid or enforceable, or that a contract be proved in a certain way, that requirement is absolute and indispensable. Consequently, the effect of non-compliance with the requirement of the Statute is simply that no action can be enforced unless the requirement is complied with. Clearly, the form required is for evidentiary purposes only. Hence, if the parties permit a contract to be proved, without any objection, it is then just as binding as if the Statute has been complied with.\n\nThe purpose of the Statute is to prevent fraud and perjury in the enforcement of obligations depending for their evidence on the unassisted memory of witnesses, by requiring certain enumerated contracts and transactions to be evidenced by a writing signed by the party to be charged.\n\nHowever, for a note or memorandum to satisfy the Statute, it must be complete in itself and cannot rest partly in writing and partly in parol. The note or memorandum must contain the names of the parties, the terms and conditions of the contract, and a description of the property sufficient to render it capable of identification. Such note or memorandum must contain the essential elements of the contract expressed with certainty that may be ascertained from the note or memorandum itself, or some other writing to which it refers or within which it is connected, without resorting to parol evidence.\"\n\nEvidently, the Reservation Agreement entered into by Spouses BBB and SMDC on June 30, 2011 constitutes the note or memorandum within the purview of Article 1403 of the New Civil Code. Consequently, the obligation of SMDC to collect the corresponding VAT over payments for the property purchased thereby should be pursuant to RR No. 16-2005 [n] being the prevailing regulation when the contract was deemed instituted and perfected.\n\nMoreover, it is a rule in statutory construction that every part of the statute must be interpreted with reference to the context, i.e., that every part of the statute must be considered together with the other parts, and kept subservient to the general intent of the whole enactment. Because the law must not be read in truncated parts, its provisions must be read in relation to the whole law. The statute's clauses and phrases must not, consequently, be taken as detached and isolated expressions, but the whole and every part thereof must be considered in fixing the meaning of any of its parts in order to produce a harmonious whole. Consistent with the fundamentals of statutory construction, all the words in the statute must be taken into consideration in order to ascertain its meaning. [3]\n\nApplying the abovementioned principle, Section 4.106-3 of RR No. 16-2011 as amended further by RR No. 03-2012, which provides that: aDSIHc\n\n\"Section 4.106-3. Sale of Real Properties. \u2014 Sale of real properties held primarily for sale to customers or held for lease in the ordinary course of trade or business of the seller shall be subject to VAT.\n\nSale of residential lot with gross selling price exceeding P1,919,500.00, residential house and lot or other residential dwellings with gross selling price exceeding P3,199,200.00, where the instrument of sale (whether the instrument is nominated as a deed of absolute sale, deed of conditional sale or otherwise) is executed and notarized on or after January 1, 2012 and shall be subject to twelve percent (12%) output VAT.\n\nHowever, for instruments of sale executed and notarized on or after Nov. 1, 2005 but prior to January 1, 2012, the threshold amounts should appropriately be P1,500,000 and P2,500,000 respectively, and excess thereof shall be subject to ten percent (10%) output VAT, and starting Feb. 1, 2006, to twelve percent (12%) output VAT.\n\nxxx xxx xxx\"\n\nshould be read with the un-amended portion of RR No. 16-2005, viz.:\n\n\"Section 4.106-3. Sale of Real Properties. \u2014 Sale of real properties held primarily for sale to customers or held for lease in the ordinary course of trade or business of the seller shall be subject to VAT.\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n\"Sale of real property on installment plan\" means sale of real property by a real estate dealer, the initial payments of which in the year of sale do not exceed twenty-five percent (25%) of the gross selling price.\n\nHowever, in the case of sale of real properties on the deferred-payment basis, not on the installment plan, the transaction shall be treated as cash sale which makes the entire selling price taxable in month of sale.\n\n\"Sale of real property by a real estate dealer on a deferred payment basis, not on the installment plan\" means sale of real property, the initial payments of which in the year of sale exceed twenty-five percent (25%) of the gross selling price.\n\n\"Initial payments\" means payment or payments which the seller receives before or upon execution of the instrument of sale and payments which he expects or is scheduled to receive in cash or property (other than evidence of indebtedness of the purchaser) during the year when the sale or disposition of the real property was made. It covers any down payment made and includes all payments actually or constructively received during the year of sale, the aggregate of which determines the limit set by law.\n\nInitial payments do not include the amount of mortgage on the real property sold except when such mortgage exceeds the cost or other basis of the property to the seller, in which case, the excess shall be considered part of the initial payments.\n\nAlso excluded from initial payments are notes or other evidence of indebtedness issued by the purchaser to the seller at the time of the sale.\n\nPre-selling of real estate properties by real estate dealers shall be subject to VAT in accordance with rules prescribed above.\n\nxxx xxx xxx\"\n\n(Emphasis and underscoring supplied)\n\nClearly, the instrument of sale (whether the instrument is nominated as a deed of absolute sale, deed of conditional sale or otherwise) contemplated on the above-cited provisions is not exclusive to those contracts which are executed and notarized. It also includes sale on installment plan reckoned from the year where the initial payment is made. ETHIDa\n\nThe partial payments made by Spouses BBB on July 30, 2011, in accordance to the execution of the Reservation Agreement are indicative of their acquiescence to and acknowledgment of the validity of the sale.\n\nLikewise, RR No. 16-2011, as amended by RR No. 03-2012 should only apply to cases where there is no other proof evidencing the perfection of the contract because in said cases, the deed of absolute sale/contract to sell is the prima facie evidence of the perfection of the contract between the parties.\n\nAccordingly, the sale of the condominium unit by Spouses BBB which is deemed instituted and perfected on June 30, 2011 and consummated on July 30, 2011 is subject to VAT. It is thus logical that the prevailing regulations during that time applies. Therefore, the purchase by Spouses BBB from SMDC of one (1) condominium unit more particularly described as Unit No. 0829-D situated at the Jazz Residences in Makati City is subject to VAT.\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be disclosed that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R.

Pasig City has an ordinance requiring companies to have their employees submit Community Tax Certificates (CTCs) and pay the additional community tax on salaries. The basis of the imposition of additional community tax by the city government is Section 157 of Republic Act (RA) No. 7160, otherwise known as the \"Local Government Code of 1991\" which provides:\n\n\"SECTION 157. Individuals Liable to Community Tax. \u2014 Every inhabitant of the Philippines eighteen (18) years of age or over who has been regularly employed on a wage or salary basis for at least thirty (30) consecutive working days during any calendar year, or who is engaged in business or occupation, or who owns real property with an aggregate assessed value of One thousand pesos (P1,000.00) or more, or who is required by law to file an income tax return shall pay an annual additional tax of Five pesos (P5.00) and an annual additional tax of One peso (P1.00) for every One thousand pesos (P1,000.00) of income regardless of whether from business, exercise of profession or from property which in no case shall exceed Five thousand pesos (P5,000).\n\nIn case of husband and wife, the additional tax herein imposed shall be based upon the total property owned by them and the total gross receipts or earnings derived by them.\" (Underscoring provided.)\n\nHowever, Section 157 of RA No. 7160 has deleted \"salaries/wages\" from its coverage hence, salaries and wages are no longer subject to additional community tax. Hence, this request.\n\nIn reply, please be informed that this Office has no jurisdiction over local taxation such as the imposition of additional community tax. We suggest to address your query to the Bureau of Local Government Finance. TAIaHE\n\nPlease be guided accordingly.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) LARRY M.

DW Morgan HK is a foreign company organized and existing under the laws of Hong Kong and engaged in ground and air services and in international trade having affiliates, subsidiaries and branch offices in the Asia Pacific Region and other foreign markets.\n\nOn December 19, 2019, DW Morgan Ph entered into a Service Contract with DW Morgan HK.

Service Agreement between DW Morgan Ph and DW Morgan HK reflecting the nature of services to be rendered by DW Morgan Ph as the domestic corporation;\n\n2. Fund Transfer Credit Advice and Certificate of Inward Remittances issued by the pertinent bank which facilitated the payment;\n\n3. VAT Official Receipts in compliance with the invoicing and accounting requirements for VAT registered persons;\n\n4. Certification of Non-Registration of Company issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to DW Morgan HK; and\n\n5. Consularized Certificate of Registration/Incorporation of DW Morgan HK, authenticated by the Philippine Embassy.\n\nIn reply, please be informed that Section 4.108-5 (b) (2) of Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 16-2005, as amended by RR 4-2007, states that:\n\n\"(b) Transactions Subject to Zero Percent (0%) VAT Rate. \u2014 The following services performed in the Philippines by a VAT-registered person shall be subject to zero percent (0%) VAT rate:\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(2) Services other than processing, manufacturing or repacking rendered to a person engaged in business conducted outside the Philippines or to a non-resident person not engaged in business who is outside the Philippines when the services are performed, the consideration for which is paid for in acceptable foreign currency and accounted for in accordance with the rules and regulations of the BSP;\"\n\nIn relation thereto, Item No. II (7) of the Guidelines and Policies provided in Revenue Memorandum Order (RMO) No. 7-2006 dated December 15, 2005, states that:\n\n\"7. Approval for VAT zero-rating shall be required only for transactions which fall under the provisions of Sections 106(A)(2)(a)(3)(5) and (6); 106(A)(2)(c); and 108(B)(3), (4) and (5) of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) of 1997, as last amended by Republic Act No. 9337. Accordingly, transactions falling under the provisions of Sections 106 (A)(2)(a)(1), (2), and (4); 106(A)(2)(b); and 108(B)(1),(2),(6) and (7) of the NIRC which are automatically considered as zero-rated shall not be covered by this Order.\" (Underscoring supplied)\n\nIn BIR Ruling No. 455-2011 dated November 16, 2011, this Office stated that in order to qualify for VAT zero rating under the above stated provision, the following requisites must concur:\n\n1. The services must be rendered to persons engaged in business outside the Philippines or to a non-resident foreign clients not engaged in business who are outside the Philippines when the services are performed; and\n\n2. The fees must be paid to the domestic corporation in acceptable foreign currency and accounted for in accordance with the rules and regulations of the BSP.\n\nAccordingly, since the services are rendered by DW Morgan PH to DW Morgan HK, a non-resident company as evidenced by the Certificate of Non-Registration of Company issued by SEC dated December 17, 2019, and paid for in acceptable foreign currency, as evidenced by the Certificates of Inward Remittances issued by pertinent banks, such as Standard Chartered Bank and Eastwest Bank, the service fees paid therefor by DW Morgan HK are automatically subject to zero percent (0%) VAT pursuant to the above-cited laws, orders and regulations, even without the necessity of applying for and securing prior approval for VAT zero-rating, as explicitly stated in RMO No. 7-2006. (BIR Ruling No. VAT-128-20 dated February 4, 2020) It must be emphasized, however, that the 0% VAT rate on the sale of services of DW Morgan Ph does not cover all its transactions as it must still show that said transactions fully comply with the above-mentioned requirements. (BIR Ruling Nos. 1065-2018 dated July 12, 2018; and 413-2012 dated July 15, 2012) Moreover, DW Morgan Ph must comply with the invoicing requirements set forth in Section 113 of the NIRC. AcICHD\n\nFurthermore, considering that the services rendered by DW Morgan Ph to DW Morgan HK qualify for VAT zero-rating, DW Morgan Ph is likewise entitled to apply for the refund of any excess or unutilized input VAT due or paid attributable to its zero-rated sale of services to DW Morgan HK, subject to the conditions provided in Section 112 (A) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, and being implemented by Section 19 of RR No. 4-2007, as amended, and supplemented by Revenue Memorandum Circular (RMC) Nos. 54-2014 and 17-2018. This Ruling shall not be construed as granting/approving the claim for refund as it is a separate process, the requirements of which must still be complied by DW Morgan Ph. (BIR Ruling No. 134-2018 dated February 2, 2018 and VAT Ruling No. 018-2005 dated September 13, 2005)\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be disclosed that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered as null and void.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R.

Thus, considering that October 31, 2020 falls on a weekend and November 2, 2020 is a special non-working holiday, the filing of the said estate tax return of the decedent is hereby extended up to November 3, 2020.\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented.

Buco, Talisay, Batangas is a domestic corporation duly registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under Company Registration No. CS201405329 dated March 21, 2014; that the primary purpose for which the corporation was established is to provide services and operate general construction, renovation, fit-out and maintaining facilities, renovations and upgrading facilities to prospective clients for a fee; that the Corporation has entered into several contracts with government agencies and local government units to provide soil testing, laboratory and analysis, preparation and submission of final geotechnical report, highway and bridge detailed engineering design, topographic survey, bridge site survey, sub surface soil exploration works and geotechnical investigation; and that as such, you now request for confirmation that the fees received by the Corporation for services rendered are subject to the 2% creditable withholding tax pursuant to Section 57 (B) of the Tax Code, as amended, in relation to Section 2.57.2 (C) of Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 2-98, as amended.\n\nIn reply, please be informed that Section 2.57.2 (C) of RR No. 2-98, as amended by RR No. 11-2018, states that:\n\n\"Section 2.57.2. Income Payments Subject to Creditable Withholding Tax and Rates Prescribed Thereon. \u2014 Except as herein otherwise provided, there shall be withheld a creditable income tax at the rates herein specified for each class of payee from the following items of income payments to persons residing in the Philippines:\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(C) Income payments to certain contractors \u2014 On gross payments to the following contractors, whether individual or corporate \u2014 Two percent (2%).\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(2) General Building contractors \u2014 Those whose principal contracting business is in connection with any structure built, for the support, shelter and enclosure of persons, animals, chattels, or movable property of any kind, requiring in its construction the use of more than two unrelated building trades or crafts, or to do or superintend the whole or any part thereto. Such structure includes sewers and sewerage disposal plants and systems, parks, playgrounds, and other recreational works, refineries, chemical plants and similar industrial plants requiring specialized engineering knowledge and skills, powerhouse, power plants and other utility plants and installation, mines and metallurgical plants, cement and concrete works in connection with the above-mentioned fixed works. CAIHTE\n\n(3) Specialty Contractors \u2014 Those whose operations pertain to the performance of construction work requiring special skill and whose principal contracting business involves the use of specialized building trades or crafts.\"\n\nThe above provision categorically enumerated the types of contractor to which withholding tax of 2% is imposable, including therein both General Engineering Contractors and Specialty Contractors.\n\nIn BIR Ruling No. 006-03 dated August 15, 2003, this Office ruled that for the purpose of withholding tax, an independent firm of quantity surveyors, cost engineers and construction cost specialists, is considered a specialty contractor. In the said ruling, the company renders quantity surveying services in building and other civil works projects including, but not limited to, initial design, tendering procedures and contract arrangements, cost studies and planning, master development programming, tender contract analysis and report, construction progress financial statement preparation, advisory contract administration, valuation of construction work in progress and cost and material supervision in each and every work phase of construction, which services pertain to the performance of construction work requiring special skill. Notwithstanding the fact that the company does not perform actual construction work, it was considered a specialty contractor, because its principal contracting business involves the use of specialized building trades or crafts. Accordingly, the said ruling states that as a specialty contractor, the professional fees that the company receives for quantity surveying services are subject to creditable withholding tax at the rate of 2% in accordance with RR No. 2-98, as amended.\n\nBased on the foregoing, this Office opines that 515 Life Construction Corporation is considered as specialty contractor since its line of business requires special skills, such as soil testing, laboratory and analysis, preparation and submission of final geotechnical report, highway and bridge detailed engineering design, topographic survey, bridge site survey, sub surface soil exploration works and geotechnical investigation, generally carrying activities in conjunction with and related to any of the services of a specialty contractor. Hence, all income payments received by 515 Life Construction Corporation as specialty contractor are subject to creditable withholding tax at the rate of 2% pursuant to Sec. 2.57.2 (C) (3) of RR No. 2-98, as amended.\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be disclosed that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R.

Rizal Street, Brgy. Poblacion, Makati City 1200\n\nAttention: Atty. Michael Arthur T. Cami\u00f1a\nCity Legal Officer\n\nGentlemen :\n\nThis refers to your letter dated October 7, 2019 requesting for exemption from the payment of capital gains tax on the sale of two (2) parcels of land between the National Government of the Republic of the Philippines through the Privatization and Management Office (PMO) and the City Government of Makati pursuant to Section 34 of Proclamation No. 50, [1] as amended. [2]\n\nIt is represented that the National Government of the Republic of the Philippines (GOP),through the PMO [3] sold two (2) parcels of land located in Makati City, with a total area of 4,435 square meters, covered by Transfer Certificate Title (TCT) No. __________ and TCT No. __________, to the City Government of Makati (CGM) as evidenced by the Deed of Absolute Sale dated March 12, 2019. These parcels of land will be used in the Subway Project through the Public-Private Partnership as the city's share in the said infrastructure and development project.\n\nRevenue District Office (RDO) No. 49 requested the presentation of a tax exemption certificate or ruling by exempt individuals and entities pursuant to Revenue Memorandum Circular (RMC) No. 8-2014 before the Certificate Authorizing Registration (CAR) may be issued since CGM claimed that the transaction was tax exempt under Section 34 of Proclamation No. 50, as amended. CGM argued that in their previous transactions dealing with properties administered by PMO, the presentation of BIR Ruling No. 403-2012, which was also presented in this case, would suffice in their claim of exemption from capital gains tax, however, RDO No. 49 insisted on their position. Hence, this request for ruling.\n\nIn reply, please be informed that Sec. 1 and Sec. 4 of Proclamation No. 50 state:\n\n\"SEC. 1. STATEMENT OF POLICY.\u2014 It shall be the policy of the State to promote privatization through an orderly, coordinated and efficient programs for the prompt disposition of the large number of non-performing assets of the government financial institutions, and certain government-owned or controlled corporations which have been found unnecessary or inappropriate for the government sector to maintain.\"\n\n\"SEC. 4. RESPONSIBILITIES AND OBJECTIVES. \u2014 It shall be the duty and responsibility of the Committee to use the powers granted to it under this Proclamation to achieve the objectives of (a) divesting to the private sector in the soonest possible time through the appropriate disposition entities, those assets with viable and productive potential as going concerns, taking into account where appropriate the implications of such transfers on sectoral productive capacities and market limitations, and (b) disposing of such other assets as may be transferred to it, generating the maximum cash recovery for the National Government in the process. These objectives are to be pursued within the context of furthering the national economic recovery through a strengthened and revitalized private enterprise system.\"\n\nWhile Section 34 of Proclamation No. 50, as amended, provides the following:\n\n\"SEC. 34. EXEMPTION FROM TAXES, FEES AND OTHER CHARGES.\u2014 The provisions of any law to the contrary notwithstanding, the Trust as well as the corporations and asset held by it, shall be exempt from all taxes, fees, charges, imposts and assessments arising from or occasioned by the passing of title over such corporations or assets from the government institutions to the Trust and/or from the Trust to a private acquisitor or buyer imposed by the National Government or any subdivision thereof including but not limited to stock transfer taxes, capital gains taxes, documentary stamps, registration fees and the like: Provided, that in case the said government institutions acquired the said assets by foreclosure, the non-payment of similar taxes, fees, charges, imposts, and assessments shall not be a bar to the consolidation of title in the foreclosing institutions and the subsequent passing of title to the Trust or the corporations held by the Trust.\n\nThe sale or transfer of such corporations or assets shall not be enjoyed or hindered by the existence of any liens by way of taxes, charges or other assessments in favor of the government at the time of sale or transfer; Provided, that the proceeds from such sale or transfer shall be subject to a tax lien and first be applied to satisfy such obligations secured by said liens.\" (Emphasis supplied)\n\nUnder the above quoted provision, the Asset Privatization Trust (now PMO) as well as the corporations and assets held by it, shall be exempt from all taxes, fees, charges, imposts, and assessments arising from or occasioned by the passing of title over such corporations or assets from the government institutions to the Trust and/or from the Trust to a private acquisitor or buyer imposed by the National Government or any subdivision thereof. [4] Thus, the PMO is exempt from the payment of CGT and DST on the Deed of Absolute Sale dated March 12, 2019 executed by and between the GOP, through the PMO, and the CGM.\n\nPlease take note however that the PMO's exemption from Documentary Stamp Tax (DST) is subject to the provisions of Section 173 of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended, which states that:\n\n\"SEC. 173. Stamp Taxes Upon Documents, Loan Agreements, Instruments and Papers.\u2014 Upon documents, instruments, loan agreements and papers, and upon acceptances, assignments, sales and transfers of the obligation, right or property incident thereto, there shall be levied, collected and paid for, and in respect of the transaction so had or accomplished, the corresponding documentary stamp taxes prescribed in the following Sections of this Title, by the person making, signing, issuing, accepting, or transferring the same wherever the document is made, signed, issued, accepted or transferred when the obligation or right arises from Philippine sources or the property is situated in the Philippines, and the same time such act is done or transaction had: Provided, That whenever one party to the taxable document enjoys exemption from the tax herein imposed, the other party who is not exempt shall be the one directly liable for the tax.\"\n\nTherefore, the CGM, which does not enjoy the same tax exemption privilege, shall be the one liable for the payment of the DST due on the said transaction.\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation it will be disclosed that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R.

De Leon\nTreasurer of the Philippines\nBureau of the Treasury\nIntramuros, Manila 1002\n\nMadam :\n\nThis refers to your letter dated September 04, 2019 requesting for tax exemption from paying taxes, fees, and charges relative to the application for Certificate Authorizing Registration (CAR) for certain properties assigned to the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr).\n\nYou represented that pursuant to Section 132 (e) of Republic Act (RA) No. 7653, otherwise known as the New Central Bank Act, the Central Bank-Board of Liquidators (CB-BOL) ceased its operation and assigned its undisposed assets to the National Government (NG), through the BTr. These gratuitous assignments are effected through the execution of Deed of Assignment, on an 'as-is-where-is' basis.\n\nSome of the CB-BOL properties assigned to BTr are not yet under the name of the Republic of the Philippines (ROP).As such, the BTr is currently coordinating with the appropriate agencies and Local Government Units (LGUs) to register the titles of the relevant CB-BOL properties under the name of ROP.\n\nSection 58 (E) of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997 (NIRC), as amended, provides that no registration of any document transferring real property can be effected by the Registry of Deeds (RD) unless the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) or his duly authorized representative has certified that such transfer has been reported, and the Capital Gains Tax (CGT) or Creditable Withholding Tax (CWT), if any, has been paid. In addition, the Certificate Authorizing Registration (CAR) issued by BIR is to be submitted to the RD as part of the documentary requirements for the titling of properties.\n\nCurrently, BTr is in process of re-titling, under the name of the ROP, the CB-BOL properties that are still titled under Ekson Realty Development & Construction, Inc. located in Brgy. Pansol, Calamba City, Laguna. Thus, this request.\n\nIn reply, to exempt the transaction from capital gains tax, the taxpayer (assignor of real property in this case) must show that he is clearly exempt by law to pay such taxes. One claiming the benefit of tax exemption must bring himself substantially within the terms of the statute or justify his claim by the clearest grant of the organic or state law. Accordingly, in the absence of a clear grant of tax exemption, the capital gains presumed to have been realized from the assignment of the real properties are taxable on the part of the assignor.\n\nConsequently, as there is no showing that the transfer of the real property from Ekson Realty Development & Construction, Inc. to CB-BOL and the transfer from CB-BOL to BTr are exempt from taxes, this Office regrets to inform you that your request for tax exemption from paying taxes, fees, and charges is hereby denied for lack of legal basis.\n\nWe also wish to inform you that exemption from the capital gains tax or any other taxes that may be imposed under the NIRC of 1997, as amended, can only be effected by an act of Congress through legislation, as the Bureau of Internal Revenue merely enforces the tax laws and cannot grant tax exemptions without a law providing for it.\n\nPlease be guided accordingly.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.)

Laurel Avenue,\nDavao City 8000\n\nAttention: AAA\n_______________\n\nGentlemen :\n\nThis refers to your letter dated December 19, 2019 requesting on behalf of ANFLO CONSTRUCTION CORPORATION for ruling or approval to change its accounting method on inventory costing from First-In-First-Out (FIFO) to Weighted Average Method for inventory costing starting January 1, 2019.\n\nAs represented, ANFLO CONSTRUCTION CORPORATION,with Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) __________, is a corporation duly organized and existing under and by virtue of Philippine laws with office address at Damosa Complex, Lanang, Davao City 8000. It was registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on February 21, 1994, with SEC Certificate of Registration No. _____.\n\nThe company was established \"to engage in general engineering construction and other allied business including the constructing, enlarging, repairing, servicing, developing, or otherwise engaging in any work upon buildings, roads, highways, manufacturing plants, bridges, airfields, piers, docks, mines, wood, masonry, and earth construction and to make, execute, bid for and take or receive any contract or assignment or contract therefore, or in relation thereto or connected therewith and to manufacture and furnish building materials and supplies connected therewith; and doing of any and all other business and constructing incidental thereto or connected therewith, and the doing or construction for and incidental to the furtherance and/or implementation of the purposes therein mentioned.\"\n\nFrom the time of its incorporation, the Company has consistently adopted the FIFO Method in costing its inventory. In 2019, the companies under the Anflo Group (the \"Group\"),which includes the Company, have adopted the Weighted Average Method in costing its inventories, as a result of the change of the Group's accounting system. In order to align the method of inventory valuation with the other companies under the Group, the Company has decided to adopt the Weighted Average Method of inventory valuation.\n\nAs further represented, the use of the Weighted Average Method of inventory valuation will not result to a substantial change in the total cost of sales and gross profit. Thus, the adoption of the new inventory valuation method will still clearly reflect the income of the Company.\n\nIn reply, please be informed that Section 41 of the National Internal Revenue Code (Tax Code) of 1997, as amended, provides:\n\n\"Section 41. Inventories. \u2014 Whenever in the judgment of the Commissioner, the use of inventories is necessary in order to determine clearly the income of any taxpayer, inventories shall be taken by such taxpayer upon such basis as the Secretary of Finance, upon the recommendation of the Commissioner, may, by rules and regulations, prescribe as conforming as nearly as may be to the best accounting practice in the trade or business and as most clearly reflecting the income.\n\nIf a taxpayer, after having complied with the terms and conditions prescribed by the Commissioner, uses a particular method of valuing its inventory for any taxable year, then such method shall be used in all subsequent taxable years unless:\n\n(i) with the approval of the Commissioner, a change to a different method is authorized;or\n\n(ii) the Commissioner finds that the nature of the stock on hand (e.g.,its scarcity, liquidity, marketability and price movements) is such that inventory gains should be considered realized for tax purposes and, therefore, it is necessary to modify the valuation method for purposes of ascertaining the income, profits, or loss in a more realistic manner: Provided, however, That the Commissioner shall not exercise its authority to require a change in inventory method more often than once every three (3) years: Provided, further, That any change in an inventory valuation method must be subject to approval by the Secretary of Finance.\" (Emphasis provided.)\n\nIn relation to the above section of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, Section 145 of Revenue Regulations No. 2 states:\n\n\"Section 145. Valuation of Inventories. \u2014 The law provides two tests to which each inventory must conform. \u2014 (1) it must conform as nearly as possible to the best accounting practice in the trade or business, and (2) it must clearly reflect the income. It follows, therefore, that inventory rules can not be uniform but must give effect to trade customs which come within the scope of the best accounting practice in the particular trade or business. In order to clearly reflect income, the inventory practice of a taxpayer should be consistent from year to year, and greater weight is to be given to consistency than to any particular method of inventory or basis of valuation, as long as the method or basis used is substantially in accord with these regulations, an inventory that can be used under the best accounting practice in a balance sheet showing the financial position of the taxpayer is, as a general rule, regarded as clearly reflecting his income.\"\n\nSince the change in ANFLO CONSTRUCTION CORPORATION's accounting method is in order to align its method of valuation with that of the other companies under the Anflo Group, its adoption of the new Weighted Average Method rather than the FIFO method of inventory starting January 1, 2019 is hereby granted permission provided that such method conforms to the best accounting practice in its trade or business and will clearly reflect the income of the company pursuant to the provision of Section 41 of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended.\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be ascertained that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R.

A.O. Floirendo, Panabo City, Davao del Norte.\n\nIt is engaged in the business of establishing agricultural settlements, acquiring, leasing, buying, developing, exploiting and occupying agricultural lands of the public domain or private persons and entities; promoting and encouraging scientific methodical farming and cooperative marketing of farm products and for such allied purposes; establishing factory or factories or processing plant or plants for the manufacture of allied products for agricultural purposes such as plastic bags, hope, twines, cartons, boxes, tin cans or containers or any kind of containers for processing, for local use and for export; engaging in the processing of agricultural products such as fruits, poultry, livestock and other similar products to be sold for local consumption and for export; acquiring such necessary machinery, equipment, tools and the like for local consumption and for export, acquiring such necessary machinery, equipment, tools and like for manufacturing or processing of agricultural products into finished products.\n\nSince its incorporation, the Company has consistently adopted the FIFO method in costing its materials and supplies. In order to facilitate its cost accounting and optimize the use of its computerized system, the Company will install computerized cost accounting system. The Computerized accounting system to be adopted is Systems Applications and Products (SAP) Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Software which recognizes the Moving Average method for materials and supplies.

Consequently, per Corporate Secretary's Certificate, the Board of Directors approved and authorized the Company to change its inventory costing method for its materials and supplies from their respective previous costing methods under Microsoft GP ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) Software to their new costing methods under SAP (Systems Applications and Products) ERP Software.

Inventories. \u2014 Whenever in the judgment of the Commissioner, the use of inventories is necessary in order to determine clearly the income of any taxpayer, inventories shall be taken by such taxpayer upon such basis as the Secretary of Finance, upon the recommendation of the Commissioner, may, by rules and regulations, prescribe as conforming as nearly as may be to the best accounting practice in the trade or business and as most clearly reflecting the income.\n\nIf a taxpayer, after having complied with the terms and conditions prescribed by the Commissioner, uses a particular method of valuing its inventory for any taxable year, then such method shall be used in all subsequent taxable years unless:\n\n(i) with the approval of the Commissioner, a change to a different method is authorized;or\n\n(ii) the Commissioner finds that the nature of the stock on hand (e.g.,its scarcity, liquidity, marketability and price movements) is such that inventory gains should be considered realized for tax purposes and, therefore, it is necessary to modify the valuation method for purposes of ascertaining the income, profits, or loss in a more realistic manner: Provided, however, That the Commissioner shall not exercise its authority to require a change in inventory method more often than once every three (3) years: Provided, further, That any change in an inventory valuation method must be subject to approval by the Secretary of Finance.\" (Emphasis provided.)\n\nIn relation, to the above section of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, Section 145 of Revenue Regulations No. 2 states:\n\n\"Section 145. Valuation of Inventories. \u2014 The law provides two tests to which each inventory must conform. \u2014 (1) it must conform as nearly as possible to the best accounting practice in the trade or business, and (2) it must clearly reflect the income. It follows, therefore, that inventory rules can not be uniform but must give effect to trade customs which come within the scope of the best accounting practice in the particular trade or business. In order to clearly reflect income, the inventory practice of a taxpayer should be consistent from year to year, and greater weight is to be given to consistency than to any particular method of inventory or basis of valuation, as long as the method of basis used is substantially in accord with these regulations, an inventory that can be used under the best accounting practice in a balance sheet showing the financial position of the taxpayer is, as a general rule, regarded as clearly reflecting his income.\"\n\nSince the change in Tagum Agricultural Development Company, Inc.'s accounting method is in order to clearly reflect the income of the said corporation in line with its adoption of the Systems Applications and Products (SAP) Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Software which uses the moving average method rather than the FIFO method of inventory costing, Tagum Agricultural Development Company, Inc. is hereby granted permission to change its accounting method from FIFO to Moving Average method starting January 1, 2019 pursuant to the provision of Section 41 of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, provided that such method conforms to the best accounting practice in its trade or business and will clearly reflect the income of said corporation.\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be ascertained that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R. DULAY\nCommissioner of Internal Revenue",

ICHDca\n\nIn reply, please be informed that pursuant to Section 22 (B) of the National Internal Revenue Code (Tax Code) of 1997, as amended, the term \"corporation\" shall include partnerships, no matter how created or organized, joint stock companies, joint accounts (cuentas en participacion),association or insurance companies, but does not include general professional partnerships and joint venture of consortium formed for the purpose of undertaking construction projects or engaging in petroleum, coal, geothermal and other energy operations pursuant to an operating or consortium agreement under a service contract with the Government.\n\nLikewise, Section 2.57.5 of RR No. 2-98, as amended by RR No. 11-2018 dated January 31, 2018, provides that the withholding of CWT shall not apply to income payments made to joint ventures or construction formed for the purpose of undertaking construction projects or engaging in petroleum, coal, geothermal & other energy operations pursuant to an operating or consortium agreement under a service contract with the Government.\n\nFurthermore, Section 3 of RR No. 10-2012 dated June 1, 2012 provides, to wit:\n\n\"SEC. 3. Joint Ventures Not Taxable as Corporations. \u2014 A joint venture or consortium formed for the purpose of undertaking construction projects which is not considered as corporation under Section 22 of the NIRC of 1997 as amended, should be:\n\n(1) for the undertaking of a construction project;\n\n(2) should involve joining or pooling of resources by licensed local contractors; that is, licensed as general contractor by the Philippine Contractors Accreditation Board (PCAB) of the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI);\n\n(3) the local contractors are engaged in construction business; and\n\n(4) the Joint Venture itself must likewise be duly licensed as such by the Philippine Contractors Accreditation Board (PCAB) of the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI).\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\nAbsent any one of the aforesaid requirements, the joint venture or consortium formed for the purpose of undertaking construction projects shall be considered as taxable corporations.\n\nIn addition, the tax-exempt joint venture or consortium as herein defined shall not include those who are mere suppliers of goods, services or capital to a construction project.\n\nThe members to a Joint Venture not taxable as corporation shall each be responsible in reporting and paying appropriate income taxes on their respective share to the joint ventures profit.\"\n\nSuch being the case, China State Construction Engineering Corporation Limited/China Geo-Engineering (Phil.) Corporation-Joint Venture formed for the purpose of undertaking the Contract Package-2, Design and Build of the Ambal-Simuay River and Rio Grande De Mindanao Flood Control Projects (Cotabato City, Sultan Kudarat and Sultan Mastura and Maguindanao) with Contract Identification No. 19Z00043 with the DPWH is considered as a joint venture not taxable as a corporation for complying with the conditions provided in RR No. 10-2012, i.e., (1) the JV is for the undertaking of construction project; (2) the JV involves joining or pooling of resources by licensed local contractors (licensed as general contractor by the PCAB); (3) the local contractors are engaged in construction business; and (4) the JV itself is duly licensed by PCAB; and therefore not subject to the corporate income tax under Section 27 (A) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended. TCAScE\n\nFurthermore, the gross payments to the joint venture on the JV Project are likewise, not subject to the two percent (2%) CWT prescribed under Section 57 (B) of the same Code, as implemented by RR No. 2-98, as amended by RR No. 14-2002. (Section 4 of RR No. 14-2002 dated September 9, 2002)\n\nThe herein joint venture, being exempt from corporate income tax, is not required to file quarterly and final adjustment returns but the co-venturers are separately subject to the regular corporate income tax imposed under Section 27 (A) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, on their taxable income during each taxable year respectively derived by them from the aforesaid construction project. (BIR Ruling No. 13-2018 dated January 10, 2018).\n\nIt should be emphasized that the respective net income of the co-venturers derived from the joint venture project is subject to the CWT imposed under Section 57 of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, and implemented by RR No. 2-98, as amended. Thus, before China State Construction Engineering Corporation Limited/China Geo-Engineering (Phil.) Corporation-Joint Venture distributes the net income of the co-venturers, pursuant to their agreed profits/income sharing, it shall withhold the tax based on the net income of its co-venturers. (BIR Ruling No. 13-2018 dated January 10, 2018)\n\nFinally, the co-venturers are required to enroll themselves to the Bureau of Internal Revenue's Electronic Filing and Payment System (EFPS). The enrollment should be done at the Revenue District Office (RDO) where they are registered as taxpayers. (Section 4 of RR No. 10-2012)\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be disclosed that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R.

Capital Gains and Losses. \u2014\n\n(A) Definitions. \u2014 As used in this Title \u2014\n\n(1) Capital Assets. \u2014 The term 'capital assets' means property held by the taxpayer (whether or not connected with his trade or business),but does not include stock in trade of the taxpayer or other property of a kind which would properly be included in the inventory of the taxpayer if on hand at the close of the taxable year, or property held by the taxpayer primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of his trade or business, or property used in the trade or business, of a character which is subject to the allowance for depreciation provided in Subsection (F) of Section 34; or real property used in trade or business of the taxpayer.\"\n\nThe foregoing provision is being implemented by Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 7-2003, issued on February 11, 2003, providing for the guidelines in the determination of whether a particular real property is a capital asset or an ordinary asset. Section 2 (a) of RR No. 7-2003 defines capital assets as referring to 'all real properties held by a taxpayer, whether or not connected with his trade or business, and which are not included among the real properties considered as ordinary assets under Sec. 39 (A) (1) of the Code. On the other hand, Section 2 (b) of the same Regulations laid down what constitutes ordinary assets as follows:\n\nb. Ordinary assets shall refer to all real properties specifically excluded from the definition of capital assets under Sec. 39(A)(1) of the Code, namely:\n\n1. Stock in trade of a taxpayer or other real property of a kind which would properly be included in the inventory of the taxpayer if on hand at the close of the taxable year; or\n\n2. Real property held by the taxpayer primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of his trade or business; or\n\n3. Real property used in trade or business (i.e., buildings and/or improvements) of a character which is subject to the allowance for depreciation provided for under Sec. 34(F) of the Code; or\n\n4. Real property used in trade or business of the taxpayer.\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\nc. Real property shall have the same meaning attributed to that term under Article 415 of Republic Act No. 386, otherwise known as the \"Civil Code of the Philippines.\" cDCSET\n\nd. Real estate dealer shall refer to any person engaged in the business of buying and selling or exchanging real properties on his own account as a principal and holding himself out as a full or part-time dealer in real estate.\n\ne. Real estate developer shall refer to any person engaged in the business of developing real properties into subdivisions, or building houses on subdivided lots, or constructing residential or commercial units, townhouses and other similar units for his own account and offering them for sale or lease.\n\nf. Real estate lessor shall refer to any person engaged in the business of leasing or renting real properties on his own account as a principal and holding himself out as lessor of real properties being rented out or offered for rent.\n\ng. Taxpayers engaged in the real estate business shall refer collectively to real estate dealers, real estate developers, and/or real estate lessors. Conversely, the term \"taxpayers not engaged in the real estate business\" shall refer to persons other than real estate dealers, real estate developers and/or real estate lessors. A taxpayer whose primary purpose of engaging in business, or whose Articles of Incorporation states that its primary purpose is to engage in the real estate business shall be deemed to be engaged in the real estate business for purposes of these Regulations.\n\nOn the other hand, Section 3 of the same Regulations provides for the guidelines in determining whether a particular real property is a capital asset or ordinary asset, to wit:\n\n\"a. Taxpayers engaged in the real estate business. \u2014 Real property shall be classified with respect to taxpayers engaged in the real estate business as follows:\n\n1. Real Estate Dealer. \u2014 All real properties acquired by the real estate dealer shall be considered as ordinary assets.\n\n2. Real Estate Developer. \u2014 All real properties acquired by the real estate developer, whether developed or undeveloped as of the time of acquisition, and all real properties which are held by the real estate developer primarily for sale or for lease to customers in the ordinary course of his trade or business or which would properly be included in the inventory of the taxpayer if on hand at the close of the taxable year and all real properties used in the trade or business, whether in the form of land, building, or other improvements, shall be considered as ordinary assets.\n\n3. Real Estate Lessor. \u2014 All real properties of the real estate lessor, whether land and/or improvements, which are for lease/rent or being offered for lease/rent, or otherwise for use or being used in the trade or business shall likewise be considered as ordinary assets.\n\n4. Taxpayers habitually engaged in the real estate business. All real properties acquired in the course of trade or business by a taxpayer habitually engaged in the sale of real estate shall be considered as ordinary assets. Registration with the HLURB or HUDCC as a real estate dealer or developer shall be sufficient for a taxpayer to be considered as habitually engaged in the sale of real estate. If the taxpayer is not registered with the HLURB or HUDCC as a real estate dealer or developer, he/it may nevertheless be deemed to be engaged in the real estate business through the establishment of substantial relevant evidence (such as consummation during the preceding year of at least six (6) taxable real estate sale transactions, regardless of amount; registration as habitually engaged in real estate business with the Local Government Unit or the Bureau of Internal Revenue, etc.).\" (Emphasis supplied)\n\nBased on the above-quoted provisions, the classification, therefore, of a particular real property as being capital or ordinary asset does not depend upon its actual use or the purpose for its acquisition, but on the nature of the business of its registered owner. IAcDET\n\nIn the instant case, it is shown that AAA is already ___ years of age and is being confined in the hospital since March 30, 2015; and due to old age and medical condition, he could not have been engaged in real estate business or any other kinds of business. This is supported by the Certification [2] issued by the Office of the City Mayor of Bacolod City that AAA has not applied nor been issued a business permit to operate any kind of business, and the Certification [3] issued by the Department of Trade and Industry that there is no business name registration filed by/as AAA. Moreover, the subject properties, being vacant idle lots, were never used in business nor leased out, as certified to by the Office of the Punong Barangay 2, Bacolod City.\n\nThe fact that AAA sold the subject properties pursuant to a Memorandum of Agreement, does not make him habitually engaged in the real estate business. To be considered as habitually engaged in the real estate business, the taxpayer must consummate during the preceding year at least six (6) taxable real estate sale transactions. It is noted that, the transaction between AAAand BGRCDC was consummated in 2017. As attested by AAA, due to his old age and medical condition, he was not able to engage in real estate business since his confinement in March 30, 2015. Hence, no real transaction was entered into in 2016, the preceding year when the transaction was consummated. LexLib\n\nThe transaction between AAA and BGRCDC is considered only as one transaction considering the fact that the subject properties were sold under one Memorandum of Agreement, and the execution of different DOAs was consistent with the terms of the MOA that the delivery and execution of DOAs shall be dependent on the amount paid by the buyer.\n\nIn view thereof and the pieces of evidence proffered, and further considering that AAA is a taxpayer not engaged in the real estate business, being not a real estate dealer, developer or lessor, it is the considered opinion of this Office that the subject real properties are classified as capital assets, the conveyance of which is subject to capital gains tax and documentary stamp tax but consequently not subject to VAT and creditable withholding tax.\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be disclosed that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R.

The phrase 'sale or exchange of services' shall likewise include:\n\n(1) The lease or the use of or the right or privilege to use any copyright, patent, design or model, plan, secret formula or process, goodwill, trademark, trade brand or other like property or right;\n\n(2) The lease or the use of, or the right to use of any industrial, commercial or scientific equipment;\n\n(3) The supply of scientific, technical, industrial or commercial knowledge or information;\n\n(4) The supply of any assistance that is ancillary and subsidiary to and is furnished as a means of enabling the application or enjoyment of any such property, or right as is mentioned in subparagraph (2) or any such knowledge or information as is mentioned in subparagraph (3);\n\n(5) The supply of services by a nonresident person or his employee in connection with the use of property or rights belonging to, or the installation or operation of any brand, machinery or other apparatus purchased from such nonresident person;\n\n(6) The supply of technical advice, assistance or services rendered in connection with technical management or administration of any scientific, industrial or commercial undertaking, venture, project or scheme;\n\n(7) The lease of motion picture films, films, tapes and discs; and\n\n(8) The lease or the use of or the right to use radio, television, satellite transmission and cable television time.\"\n\nUndisputedly, the agreement between the City Government of Quezon City and Vireo Loadworks, Inc. to provide ICT services for _______________ Pesos is within the purview of the above-cited provision. Inevitably, the payment of VAT follows.\n\nThe rule that tax exemptions are to be construed in strictissimi juris against the taxpayer is well settled. Corollary to this rule is the principle that when a taxpayer claims an exemption, he must point to some specific provision of the statute in which that exemption is authorized and must be able to prove that he is entitled to the exemption which the law allows. [1] A tax exemption is effectively a social subsidy granted by the State because an exempt institution is spared from sharing in the expenses of government and yet benefits from them. A profit-making entity should not be allowed to exploit this subsidy to the detriment of the government and other taxpayers. [2]\n\nIn view of the foregoing, this Office hereby rules to deny your request for VAT exemption due to lack of factual and legal basis.\n\nPlease be guided accordingly. aScITE\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.)

Napnapan, Pantukan,\nComval Province 8809\n\nAttention: AAA\n_______________\n\nGentlemen :\n\nThis refers to your letter dated October 4, 2019 requesting for ruling or approval to change its accounting method on inventory costing from First-In-First-Out (FIFO) to Moving Average Method for materials and supplies inventory starting January 1, 2019.\n\nAs represented, ANFLO BANANA CORPORATION,with Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) 000-000-000-000, is a corporation duly organized and existing under and by virtue of Philippine laws with office address at Barangay Napnapan, Municipality of Pantukan, Province of Compostela Valley. It is engaged in the business of establishing agricultural venture, acquiring, leasing, buying, developing, exploiting and occupying agricultural lands of the public domain or private persons and entities; promoting and encouraging scientific methodical farming and cooperative marketing of farm products and for such allied purposes.\n\nSince its incorporation, the Company has consistently adopted the FIFO method in costing its materials and supplies. In order to facilitate its cost accounting and optimize the use of its computerized system, the Company will install computerized cost accounting system. The Computerized Accounting System (CAS) to be adopted is Systems Applications and Products (SAP) Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Software which recognizes the Moving Average method for materials and supplies. Correspondingly, the Moving Average Method will be a more effective costing method for the valuation of inventories and will best conform to the Company's Accounting Practice as said valuation method will clearly reflect its income.\n\nConsequently, per Corporate Secretary's Certificate, the Board of Directors approved and authorized the Company to change its inventory costing method, for materials and supplies, from FIFO costing method under Microsoft GP ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) Software to Moving Average costing method under SAP (Systems Applications and Products) ERP Software. Hence, the request for a ruling providing for the approval to change accounting method on inventory costing, viz.: HEITAD\n\nInventory\n\nFrom\n\nTo\n\nMaterials\n\nFIFO\n\nMoving Average\n\nSupplies\n\nFIFO\n\nMoving Average\n\nIn reply, please be informed that Section 41 of the National Internal Revenue Code (Tax Code) of 1997, as amended, provides:\n\n\"Section 41. Inventories. \u2014 Whenever in the judgment of the Commissioner, the use of inventories is necessary in order to determine clearly the income of any taxpayer, inventories shall be taken by such taxpayer upon such basis as the Secretary of Finance, upon the recommendation of the Commissioner, may, by rules and regulations, prescribe as conforming as nearly as may be to the best accounting practice in the trade or business and as most clearly reflecting the income.\n\nIf a taxpayer, after having complied with the terms and conditions prescribed by the Commissioner, uses a particular method of valuing its inventory for any taxable year, then such method shall be used in all subsequent taxable years unless:\n\n(i) with the approval of the Commissioner, a change to a different method is authorized;or\n\n(ii) the Commissioner finds that the nature of the stock on hand (e.g.,its scarcity, liquidity, marketability and price movements) is such that inventory gains should be considered realized for tax purposes and, therefore, it is necessary to modify the valuation method for purposes of ascertaining the income, profits, or loss in a more realistic manner: Provided, however, That the Commissioner shall not exercise its authority to require a change in inventory method more often than once every three (3) years: Provided, further, That any change in an inventory valuation method must be subject to approval by the Secretary of Finance.\" (Emphasis provided.)\n\nIn relation to the above section of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, Section 145 of Revenue Regulations No. 2 states:\n\n\"Section 145. Valuation of Inventories. \u2014 The law provides two tests to which each inventory must conform. \u2014 (1) it must conform as nearly as possible to the best accounting practice in the trade or business, and (2) it must clearly reflect the income. It follows, therefore, that inventory rules can not be uniform but must give effect to trade customs which come within the scope of the best accounting practice in the particular trade or business. In order to clearly reflect income, the inventory practice of a taxpayer should be consistent from year to year, and greater weight is to be given to consistency than to any particular method of inventory or basis of valuation, as long as the method of basis used is substantially in accord with these regulations, an inventory that can be used under the best accounting practice in a balance sheet showing the financial position of the taxpayer is, as a general rule, regarded as clearly reflecting his income.\"\n\nSince the change in ANFLO BANANA CORPORATION's accounting method is in order to clearly reflect the income of the said corporation in line with its adoption of the Systems Applications and Products (SAP) Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Software which uses the moving average method rather than the FIFO method of inventory costing, ANFLO BANANA CORPORATION is hereby granted permission to change its accounting method from FIFO to Moving Average method starting January 1, 2019 pursuant to the provision of Section 41 of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, provided that such conforms to the best accounting practice in its trade or business and will clearly reflect the income of the Company.\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be ascertained that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void. ATICcS\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R.

The corresponding taxes due on the sale of the said property were already paid. However, Revenue District Office (RDO) No. 027 issued assessment for Value-Added Tax (VAT).Hence, this query on whether or not the subject real property owned by the Macalinos are considered capital assets.\n\nIn reply thereto, please be informed that Section 2 (t) of the Revenue Bulletin No. 1-2003, (Prescribing the Procedure and Guidelines for the Proper Handling of Request for Rulings Which are Determined Hereunder as \"No-Ruling Areas\"), and Providing the Initial List of \"No-Ruling Areas\" provides, as quoted herein below, to wit:\n\n\"Section 2.

Joint Venture\nKm 9 West Service Rd.,Brgy. Marcelo,\nGreen Village, Para\u00f1aque City 1700\n\nAttention: AAA\n______________\n\nGentlemen :\n\nThis refers to your request for a ruling that the joint venture between First Balfour, Inc. and MRAIL, Inc. (First Balfour-MRAIL Joint Venture),formed for the purpose of undertaking the Rehabilitation of LRT Line 1 Rectifier Substations (\"JV Project\"), is exempt from the two percent (2%) creditable withholding tax pursuant to Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 14-2002, as amended by RR No. 11-2018.

MRAIL, Inc.,with TIN 000-000-000-000, SEC Registration No. CS200908797, and PCAB Contractor's License Form No. 34932 originally issued on January 10, 2011.\n\nThe herein co-venturers have mutually bind each other to contribute to the Joint Venture in accordance with the following participation shares \u2014 First Balfour, Inc. \u2014 fifty-one percent (51%),and MRAIL, Inc. \u2014 forty-nine percent (49%) share, for all the necessary capital, equipment, technical personnel, management, supervision, and other efforts and resources for the proper execution or implementation of the Joint Venture Project and to extend to each other their respective fullest cooperation and best effort towards the successful construction and completion of the Joint Venture Project in accordance with the Project Contract.\n\nOn January 03, 2019, First Balfour-MRAIL Joint Venture was registered with the BIR, as a regular taxable corporation liable for corporate income tax, and was issued with TIN 000-000-000-000. Hence, this request.\n\nIn reply, please be informed that pursuant to Section 22 (B) of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) of 1997, as amended, the term \"corporation\" shall include partnerships, no matter how created or organized, joint stock companies, joint accounts (cuentas en participacion),associations or insurance companies, but does not include general professional partnerships and a joint venture or consortium formed for the purpose of undertaking construction projects or engaging in petroleum, coal, geothermal and other energy operations pursuant to an operating or consortium agreement under a service contract with the Government.\n\nLikewise, Section 2.57.5 (5) of RR No. 2-98, as amended, provides that:\n\n\"SECTION 2.57.5. Exemption from Withholding. \u2014 The withholding of creditable withholding tax prescribed in these Regulations shall not apply to income payments made to the following:\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(B) Persons enjoying exemption from payment of income taxes pursuant to the provisions of any law, general or special, such as but not limited to the following:\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(5) Joint ventures or consortium formed for the purpose of undertaking construction projects or engaging in petroleum, coal, geothermal and other energy operations pursuant to an operating or consortium agreement under a service contract with the government. Provided, however, joint ventures or consortium formed for the purpose of undertaking construction projects shall comply with the following conditions to be considered as joint venture not taxable as a corporation:\n\na) Should involve joining or pooling of resources by licensed local contracts; that is, licensed as general contractor by the Philippine Contractors Accreditation Board (PCAB) of the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI);\n\nb) These local contractors are engaged in construction business; and\n\nc) The Joint Venture itself must likewise be duly licensed as such by the PCAB of the DTI.\"\n\nMoreover, Section 3 of RR No. 10-2012, implementing Section 22 (B) of the NIRC of 1997, states that:\n\n\"SEC. 3. Joint Ventures Not Taxable as Corporations. \u2014 A joint venture or consortium formed for the purpose of undertaking construction projects which is not considered as corporation under Section 22 of the NIRC of 1997 as amended, should be:\n\n(1) for the undertaking of a construction project; and\n\n(2) should involve joining or pooling of resources by licensed local contractors that is, licensed as general contractor by the Philippine Contractors Accreditation Board (PCAB) of the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI);\n\n(3) the local contractors are engaged in construction business; and\n\n(4) the Joint Venture itself must likewise be duly licensed as such by the Philippine Contractors Accreditation Board (PCAB) of the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI).\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\nAbsent any one of the aforesaid requirements, the joint venture or consortium formed for the purpose of undertaking construction projects shall be considered as taxable corporations. In addition, the tax-exempt joint venture or consortium as herein defined shall not include those who are mere suppliers of goods, services or capital to a construction project.\n\nThe members to a Joint Venture not taxable as corporation shall each be responsible in reporting and paying appropriate income taxes on their respective share to the joint ventures profit.\"\n\nSuch being the case, the First Balfour-MRAIL Joint Venture formed for the purpose of undertaking the Rehabilitation of LRT Line 1 Rectifier Substations is considered a joint venture not taxable as a corporation for complying with the conditions provided in RR No. 10-2012, i.e., (1) the Joint Venture is for the undertaking of construction project; (2) the JV involves joining or pooling of resources by licensed local contractors (licensed as general contractor by the PCAB); (3) the local contractors are engaged in construction business; and (4) the Joint Venture itself is duly licensed by PCAB; and therefore not subject to the corporate income tax under Section 27 (A) of the NIRC of 1997, as amended. aScITE\n\nFurthermore, the gross payments to the First Balfour-MRAIL Joint Venture on the Joint Venture Project are likewise not subject to the 2% creditable withholding tax prescribed under Section 57 (B) of the same Code, as implemented by RR No. 2-98, as amended.\n\nFirst Balfour-MRAIL Joint Venture being exempt from corporate income tax, is not required to file quarterly and final adjustment returns.\n\nHowever, the co-venturers are separately subject to the regular corporate income tax imposed under Section 27 (A) of the NIRC of 1997, as amended, on their taxable income during each taxable year respectively derived by them from the aforesaid construction project. (BIR Ruling No. 1421-18 dated December 7, 2018)\n\nIt should be emphasized that the respective net income of the co-venturers derived from the Joint Venture Project is subject to the creditable withholding tax imposed under Section 57 of the NIRC of 1997, as amended, and implemented by RR No. 2-98, as amended. Thus, before First Balfour-MRAIL Joint Venture distributes the net income to the co-venturers, pursuant to their agreed profits/income sharing, it shall withhold the tax based on the net income of its co-venturers and remit the same to the BIR. (BIR Ruling No. 1421-18 dated December 7, 2018)\n\nFinally, the co-venturers are required to enroll themselves to the Bureau of Internal Revenue's Electronic Filing and Payment System (eFPS).The enrollment should be done at the Revenue District Office (RDO) where they are registered as taxpayers. [1]\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be disclosed that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R.

Ortigas, Jr. Road, Ortigas Center, 1605 Pasig City\n\nAttention: AAA\n\nGentlemen :\n\nThis refers to your letter dated February 16, 2010 requesting on behalf of your client, BBB (BBB),liquidator of the National Steel Corporation (NSC),for confirmation of the tax exemptions and/or waiver from the payment of taxes arising from two (2) sales transactions over four (4) parcels of land located in Kalawaan, Pasig City (the \"Properties\"),covered by the following Transfer Certificates of Title (TCT),to wit: HTcADC\n\nTCT No.\n\nArea (in sq. m.)\n\n31,089\n\n4,700\n\n10,376\n\n5,139\n\nTOTAL\n\n51,244\n\nThis request is being made to support your application for the issuance of Certificates Authorizing Registration (CAR) for the sales transactions over the Properties, as follows:\n\na) First CAR \u2014 for the sale by the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) of the Properties to the National Development Corporation (NDC) under a Deed of Sale executed on August 26, 1983; and\n\nb) Second CAR \u2014 for the sale by NDC of the Properties to NSC under a Contract of Sale dated September 29, 1983.\n\nAs represented, BBB was appointed Liquidator of NSC pursuant to the Order of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued on November 7, 2000 in SEC Case No. __________. As such Liquidator, he is tasked with pooling all assets of NSC in trust for all its current creditors. While NSC has been in possession of the owner's duplicate copies of the TCTs over the Properties since May 8, 1996, to date, the TCTs over the Properties remain in the name of DBP, by reason of inability of NSC to obtain the CARs over the above mentioned sales transactions over the Properties.\n\nBackground\n\n1. The Properties were acquired by DBP from Elizalde Steel Consolidated, Inc. (\"Eliscon\") under a Deed of Cession of Property in Payment of Debt executed on December 28, 1978. DBP subsequently consolidated its title over the Properties and obtained the TCTs over the Properties in its name.\n\n2. Under a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) executed by and between DBP and NDC on May 4, 1983, NDC agreed to purchase and acquire from DBP and DBP agreed to sell, transfer and convey to NDC, the Properties [1] in accordance with the following conditions:\n\n\u2022 The sale and purchase would be effected at Closing, which, as stipulated in the MOA, is to take place within one hundred eighty (180) days from the signing of the MOA, subject to compliance with certain conditions. [2]\n\n\u2022 One of the conditions for Closing is the delivery by NDC of the agreed purchase price of the Properties in the amount of P____________, in the manner provided for under the MOA, i.e.,by way of the delivery by NDC to DBP of non-negotiable promissory notes of NDC covering a period of thirty (30) years. [3]\n\n\u2022 Upon Closing, DBP would execute and deliver its grant deed or grant deeds to the (Properties),duly acknowledged, in form suitable for recordation with the Register of Deeds, for transfer of title to NDC. [4]\n\n3. Within the above mentioned 180-day period for Closing, or on August 26, 1983, DBP and NDC executed a Deed of Sale, under which DBP sold, transferred and conveyed to NDC the assets of Eliscon, including the Properties.\n\n4. On September 29, 1983, NDC and NSC executed a Contract of Sale over the Properties, under which NDC sold, transferred and assigned all of its rights, title and interest in and to the Properties to NSC. Notwithstanding that the agreed purchase price was payable over a period of thirty (30) years, the Contract of Sale explicitly provided that all of NDC's rights, title and interest in the Properties would pass to NSC upon the execution of the Contract of Sale, and that NSC shall be responsible for effecting the registration and transfer of the titles over the Properties from the present registered owner (i.e.,DBP) to NSC. [5] Additionally, under the Contract of Sale, all taxes due on the transaction were passed on to NSC as the buyer of the Properties. [6]\n\n5. Under cover of a letter dated May 8, 1996, NDC delivered the TCTs over the Properties to NSC for the purpose of enabling NSC to transfer the same to its name.\n\n6. The subject sale and purchase transactions were granted tax-exempt status as follows:\n\n\u2022 For the sale from DBP to NDC:\n\n(a) Prior to the execution of the Deed of Sale between DBP and NDC, in a Memorandum signed by Cesar C. Zalamea, then Chairman of the DBP, and Manuel Elizalde, Jr.,addressed to then President Ferdinand E. Marcos (Pres. Marcos),DBP requested that the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) grant a waiver on documentation costs and taxes, as well as registration fees,on the sale of the Properties by DBP to NDC.\n\n(b) The aforesaid request was approved by then Pres. Marcos, as indicated in his handwritten approval on the Memorandum.\n\n(c) The grant by then Pres. Marcos of the aforesaid request was confirmed in the June 1, 1983 letter of the BIR, through then Deputy Commissioner Tomas Toledo, in which it was confirmed that the documentation costs, taxes and registration fees that may be due to the Bureau on the aforesaid sale agreement (between DBP and NDC) are waived.\n\n\u2022 For the sale from NDC to NSC:\n\n(a) In a letter dated July 1, 1996, NSC requested the BIR for the issuance of a certificate of exemption and authority to register the sale of the Properties from NDC to NSC, citing that under the Contract of Sale, all taxes from the sale transaction were assumed by NSC as the buyer of the Properties, and that at the time of the execution of the Contract of Sale, NSC was exempt from the payment of all internal revenue taxes by reason of its being registered as a preferred pioneer enterprise with the Board of Investment (BOI). CAIHTE\n\n(b) In response to the aforesaid letter of NSC, BIR Ruling No. DA-053-97 dated February 2, 1997 was issued to NSC, confirming that the Contract of Sale was exempted from the payment of Documentary Stamp Taxes (DST) by virtue of the tax exemptions granted to NSC as an entity registered with the BOI under the Omnibus Investments Code [Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1789]. The said BIR Ruling further stated that the same serves as (the) authority (of NSC) to secure a Certificate of Registration from the Revenue District Officer concerned authorizing registration of the aforesaid properties covered by the Contract of Sale executed by and between the (NDC),as seller, and (NSC),as buyer, without payment of the DST x x x.\n\n7. NSC had previously attempted to obtain CARs for the subject transactions over the Properties, but was not able to follow up on the same. You have revived the said CAR applications for the purpose of obtaining the registration of the Properties in the name of NSC. Following the advice of Revenue District Office (RDO) No. 43, you request for a ruling affirming the aforesaid tax waiver/exemption ruling, particularly in respect of the DST and other taxes due on the August 26, 1983 Deed of Sale between DBP and NDC.\n\nBased on the foregoing, this Office now rules on the following issues raised for our consideration:\n\nSale from DBP to NDC\n\nPresident Marcos has the power\nto grant tax waiver on the sale of\nthe Property by DBP to NDC.\n\nArt. VII, Sec. 1 of the 1987 Philippine Constitution provides that \"[t]he executive power shall be vested in the President of the Philippines.\" Although the Constitution enumerates the powers exercised by the President, it does not define what is meant by executive power. In Marcos vs. Manglapus, G.R. No. 88211 September 15, 1989, the Supreme Court in answering the issue on whether the President's powers are limited to those specifically enumerated in the Constitution, held the view that \"the powers of the President cannot be said to be limited only to the specific powers enumerated in the Constitution. In other words, executive power is more than the sum of specific powers so enumerated.\" Citing the landmark decision of Springer v. Government of the Philippine Islands, 277 U.S. 189 (1928), the High Court stated that whatever power inherent in the government that is neither legislative nor judicial has to be executive. It should be mentioned though that under the 1973 Constitution President Marcos was also the de facto Legislature hence, his acts were considered valid exercise of legislative power.\n\nThe taxing power of the President to pursue his policy objectives may be exercised by him through executive action i.e.,executive orders and regulations. In cases where laws limit the President's power to pursue his policy objectives, he can submit his proposal to Congress by taking the legislative route. The President likewise pursues his policy objectives through the exercise of his power of appointment and removal of agency heads and issuance of executive orders and presidential memoranda directing executive officials to take specific actions.\n\nIn the instant case, DBP requested then President Marcos, through a Memorandum signed by then DBP Chairman Cesar Zalamea and Manuel Elizalde, Jr.,that the BIR grant a waiver on documentation costs and taxes, as well as registration fees, on the sale by DBP of the Properties to NDC. The request was granted by President Marcos through a handwritten approval dated April 23, 1983 on the aforesaid Memorandum.\n\nPremises considered, it follows that President Marcos had the power to grant the aforesaid waiver of taxes.\n\nTHEREFORE, this Office hereby affirms, what was already confirmed by then Deputy Commissioner Tomas Toledo in his June 1, 1983 letter addressed to DBP Chairman Cesar C. Zalamea, that the documentation costs, taxes and registration fees that may be due to the BIR on the aforesaid sale agreement are waived.\n\nSale from NDC to NSC\n\nUnder Section 318 of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1977, as amended (Tax Code), the provision of law governing the prescriptive period of the right to assess and collect taxes at the time of transaction, internal revenue taxes shall be assessed within five (5) years after the return was filed. It is only in cases of false or fraudulent return with intent to evade tax or of failure to file a return that the tax may be assessed or a proceeding in court for the collection of such tax may be begun without assessment, at any time within ten (10) years after the discovery of the falsity, fraud or omission. (Section 223, Tax Code).\n\nSection 319 (a) of the Tax Code provides that in the case of failure to file a return, the period of limitation of assessment and collection of taxes does not set in.\n\nBased on the above-cited provision, when a return is filed beyond the period prescribed by law, the taxes that may be due thereon should be assessed within five (5) years from the date of the actual filing thereof. In the case at hand, the records show that the capital gains tax return for the transfer of the Properties from NDC to NSC was filed on February 13, 1997. Accordingly, the BIR had until February 13, 2002 to assess and collect the taxes due on the sale of the Property by NDC to NSC. As there was no assessment issued either to NDC or NSC within the five-year period, the right of the Government to assess and collect capital gains tax due on the transfer is now barred by prescription. Hence, all other issues raised are moot and academic.\n\nOn the basis of the foregoing, the Revenue District Officer of Revenue District Office No. 43 is hereby directed to issue the corresponding Certificate Authorizing Registration (CAR) to authorize the transfer of the Properties in favor of NSC subject to submission and presentation of the mandatory documents necessary to facilitate the issuance of the CAR.\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be ascertained that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void. aScITE\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R. DULAY\nCommissioner of Internal Revenue\n\n1. Section 1, DBP-NDC MOA.\n\n2. Section 1 in relation to Section 4, DBP-NDC MOA.\n\n3. Section 5.2.1 in relation to Section 2, DBP-NDC MOA.\n\n4.

Col. Bonny Serrano Road\nQuezon City\n\nAttention: AAA\n_______________\n\nGentlemen :\n\nThis refers to your letter dated April 2, 2014, requesting for a ruling regarding the issuance of a new Certificate Authorizing Registration (CAR) for the account of Sps. BBB and CCC (\"Sps. BBCC\").\n\nIt is represented that sometime in June 2004, Centennial Savings Bank (\"CSB\"),then a savings bank majority owned by the Armed Forces and Police Savings and Loan Association, Inc. (\"AFPSLAI\") initiated the consolidation of ownership of the mortgaged real estate properties of Sps. BBCC covered by Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) Nos. _____ and _____ after the latter failed to redeem the subject properties within the redemption period. Subsequently, after payment of the appropriate taxes (documentary stamp tax [DST] and capital gains tax [CGT]),Revenue District Office (RDO) No. 26-Malabon City processed and issued CAR No. __________ dated July 13, 2004 in favor of CSB. However, the consolidation process was stalled on account of CSB's failure to cause the required revalidation of the aforesaid CAR with RDO No. 26-Malabon City until the time that CSB sold its share to Sterling Bank of Asia (\"SBA\") through a \"Clean Balance Sheet\" scheme sometime in the early part of August 2009 due to continuous financial losses in its operation. Under the said scheme, SBA will acquire selected assets and assume the outstanding liabilities of CSB except the deposit of AFPSLAI who is the majority owner of CSB.\n\nOn August 14, 2009, CSB assigned its remaining assets which are not part of the \"Clean Balance Sheet\" scheme as liquidating dividend by executing a Deed of Assignment (pursuant to liquidation) in favor of AFPSLAI. The aforesaid real estate properties of Sps. BBCC were among those assets that were assigned to AFPSLAI.\n\nOn October 12, 2011, CAR No. __________ was issued revalidating CAR No. __________ dated July 13, 2004. Thereafter, on November 11, 2011, AFPSLAI filed an Affidavit of Consolidation of Ownership involving the above-mentioned real properties with the Registry of Deeds of Malabon City (RD-Malabon City) on the basis of the Deed of Assignment (pursuant to liquidation) dated August 14, 2009, executed by CSB in favor of AFPSLAI. However, RD-Malabon City averred that the consolidation and/or transfer of ownership can only be consummated upon submission of a CAR that is duly issued under AFPSLAI's corporate name in order to establish its juridical status and interest over the said foreclosed properties.\n\nAccordingly, on February 20, 2013, AFPSLAI requested RDO No. 26-Malabon City through a letter addressed to then OIC Revenue District Officer, Bonifacio L. Caringal, seeking amendment of CAR No. __________ dated October 12, 2011 to the effect that the same is issued in the name of AFPSLAI. Acting on the said request, RDO No. 26-Malabon City advised AFPSLAI to elevate its concern and request for the issuance of a ruling on the matter if such amendment is legally tenable. Hence, this request.\n\nIn reply, please be informed that amendment of CAR No. __________ dated October 12, 2011 to the effect that the same is issued in the name of AFPSLAI is without legal basis, for there are two (2) transactions involved in this case which requires the issuance of two (2) CARs, to wit:\n\n(1) the consolidation of ownership of the mortgaged real estate properties of Sps. BBC after the latter failed to redeem the subject properties within the redemption period, leading to the issuance of CAR No. __________ dated July 13, 2004 which was subsequently cancelled by CAR No. __________ dated October 12, 2011; and\n\n(2) the Deed of Assignment (pursuant to liquidation) dated August 14, 2009 executed by CSB in favor of AFPSLAI, which requires the issuance of a new CAR in favor of the latter, after payment of the necessary taxes, if any.\n\nThe question now arises whether or not the Deed of Assignment (pursuant to liquidation) dated August 14, 2009 executed by CSB in favor of AFPSLAI, shall be subject to the payment of taxes. Pursuant to Section 8 of Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 06-08 [1] dated April 22, 2008, individual shareholders shall recognize capital gains upon surrender of shares computed as excess of the cash and fair market value of property received over the cost of the investment in shares and that such gain shall be subject to the regular income tax rates, to wit:\n\n\"SECTION 8. Taxation of Surrender of Shares by the Investor Upon Dissolution of the Corporation and Liquidation of Assets and Liabilities of Said Corporation. \u2014 Upon surrender by the investor of the shares in exchange for cash and property distributed by the issuing corporation upon its dissolution and liquidation of all assets and liabilities, the investor shall recognize either capital gain or capital loss upon such surrender of shares computed by comparing the cash and fair market value of property received against the cost of the investment in shares. The difference between the sum of the cash and the fair market value of property received and the cost of the investment in shares shall represent the capital gain or capital loss from the investment, whichever is applicable. If the investor is an individual, the rule on holding period shall apply and the percentage of taxable capital gain or deductible capital loss shall depend on the number of months or years the shares are held by the investor. Section 39 of the Tax Code, as amended, shall herein apply in all possible situations.\n\nThe capital gain or loss derived therefrom shall be subject to the regular income tax rates imposed under the Tax Code, as amended, on individual taxpayers or to the corporate income tax rate, in case of corporations.\"\n\nThus, if the fair market value of the subject real properties received by AFPSLAI exceeds its cost of investment, it shall recognize a gain subject to the regular (graduated) income tax rates. Conversely, if the fair market value of the subject real properties received as liquidating dividends does not exceed the cost of its investment, no taxable gain will be recognized by AFPSLAI. [2]\n\nMoreover, no tax shall be imposed on the liquidating corporation's receipt of the shares surrendered by the shareholders because the transaction is not treated as a sale. In BIR Ruling No. 1133-2018 dated August 28, 2018, citing BIR Ruling No. 092-99 dated July 8, 1999, this Office ruled, viz.:\n\n\"The transfer by the liquidating corporation of its remaining assets to its stockholders is not considered as a sale of these assets. Thus, a liquidating corporation does not realize gain or loss in partial or complete liquidation. [W.P. Fax & Sons, Inc., Petitioner v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, Respondent, 15 BTA 115; Jordan Petroleum Company, 13 AFTR 2d 1692 (227 F. Supp. 174); J.T.S. Brown & Son Company v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 10 TC 840] Hence, the transfer by Fundamental Development Corporation of its assets, i.e., one (1) parcel of land, to its controlling stockholders by way of liquidating dividends is not subject to the expanded creditable withholding tax imposed under Revenue Regulations No. 6-85, as amended by Revenue Regulations No. 12-94, as last amended by Revenue Regulations No. 2-98 (BIR Ruling No. 059-90 dated April 17, 1990), and consequently, the same is not subject to the corporate income tax.\"\n\nFurthermore, in Victoria Fernando vs. Sps. Lim,[3] the Supreme Court held that no tax shall be imposed on the liquidating corporation's receipt of the shares surrendered by the shareholders because the transaction is not treated as a sale. In the said case, the Court had the opportunity to discuss the nature of a liquidating dividend and its tax consequence, as follows:\n\n\"The share of each stockholder in the remaining assets of the corporation upon liquidation, after the payment of all corporate debts and liabilities, is what is known as liquidating dividend. In its interpretation of recent tax laws, the Bureau of Internal Revenue viewed the distribution of liquidating dividends not as a sale of asset by the liquidating corporation to its stockholder but as a sale of shares by the stockholder to the corporation or the surrender of the stockholder's interest in the corporation, in place of which said stockholder receives property or money from the corporation about to be dissolved. Thus, on the part of the stockholder, any gain or loss is subject to tax, while on the part of the liquidating corporation, no tax is imposed on its receipt of the shares surrendered by the stockholder or transfer of assets to said stockholder because said transaction is not treated as a sale.\" (Citations omitted and emphasis supplied)\n\nAccordingly, no tax shall be imposed on CSB on its receipt of shares surrendered by the stockholders or the transfer of assets to said stockholders because said transaction is not treated as a sale. Thus, CSB shall not be liable for income tax on the transfer of the subject real properties to AFPSLAI by way of liquidating dividends. [4]\n\nFurthermore, the DST imposed under Section 196 of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended, shall not apply in transfers of real property as liquidating dividends to its remaining stockholders. Section 196 of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended, provides:\n\n\"SEC. 196. Stamp tax on Deeds of Sale, Conveyances and Donations of Real Property. \u2014 On all conveyances, donations, deeds, instruments, or writings, other than grants, patents or original certificates of adjudication issued by the government, whereby any land, tenement, or other realty sold shall be granted, assigned, transferred, donated or otherwise conveyed to the purchaser, or purchasers, or to any other person or persons designated by such purchaser or purchasers, or donee, there shall be collected a documentary stamp tax, at the rates herein below prescribed, based on the consideration contracted to be paid for such realty or on its fair market value determined in accordance with Section 6(E) of this Code, whichever is higher: Provided, That when one of the contracting parties is the Government the tax herein imposed shall be based on the actual consideration.\n\n(a) When the consideration, or value received or contracted to be paid for such realty, after making proper allowance of any encumbrance, does not exceed One thousand pesos (P1,000),Fifteen pesos (P15.00).\n\n(b) For each additional One thousand pesos (P1,000) or fractional part thereof in excess of One thousand pesos (P1,000) of such consideration or value, Fifteen pesos (P15.00).\n\nHowever, the above provision does not apply to transfers of property as return of capital. RR No. 26 further provides that conveyance of real property by a corporation without consideration to the owner of its capital stock is not subject to DST. Section 189 of RR No. 26 provides:\n\n\"Section 189. Conveyance by corporation to owner of all the capital. \u2014 A conveyance of real estate by a corporation without valuable consideration to an owner of all its capital stock in consequence of its dissolution is not subject to tax.\"\n\nIn BIR Ruling No. 028-2002 dated July 22, 2002, this Office ruled that:\n\n\"Since the stockholders of Rose Packing Company, Inc. will receive upon its liquidation its assets consisting of the aforementioned land as liquidating dividends, they will thereby realize capital gain or loss. The gain, if any, derived by the individual stockholders consisting of the difference between the fair market value of the liquidating dividends and the adjusted cost to the stockholders of their respective shareholdings in the said corporation [Sec. 256, Income Tax Regulations] shall be subject to income tax at the rates prescribed under then Section 21(a) of the Tax Code, as amended by Executive Order No. 37. Moreover, pursuant to then Section 33(B) of the Tax Code, as amended, only 50% of the aforementioned capital gain is reportable for income tax purposes if the shares were held by the individual stockholders for more than twelve months and 100% of the capital gains if the shares were held for less than twelve months. Finally, this Office has ruled that the conveyance of real property in the form of liquidating dividends to the stockholders is not subject to documentary stamp tax under Section 196 of the Tax Code.\" (Underscoring ours)\n\nConsequently, Section 196 of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended, shall not apply to the distribution of assets as liquidating dividends. Therefore, the transfer of the subject real properties of CSB to AFPSLAI shall not be subject to DST.\n\nIt is, however, understood that this Ruling is never intended and shall not be construed as giving authority to the concerned Register of Deeds to effect transfer of the subject real properties in the name of AFPSLAI without the necessary certificate of authority to register issued by this Bureau. In this regard, this Ruling shall be presented to the RDO concerned in order for the latter to issue the CAR.\n\nPlease take note also that before the issuance of the CAR on the transfer of the subject real properties by CSB to AFPSLAI, CSB should first apply for the closure of its business due to cessation/termination before the RDO where it is registered.\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation it will be disclosed that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R.

In case of retirement, the employee shall be entitled to receive such retirement benefits as he may have earned under existing laws and any collective bargaining agreement and other agreements: Provided, however, That an employee's retirement benefits under any collective bargaining and other agreements shall not be less than those provided herein.\n\nIn the absence of a retirement plan or agreement providing for retirement benefits of employees in the establishment, an employee upon reaching the age of sixty (60) years or more, but not beyond sixty-five (65) years which is hereby declared the compulsory retirement age, who has served at least five (5) years in the said establishment, may retire and shall be entitled to retirement pay equivalent to at least one-half (1/2) month salary for every year of service, a fraction of at least six (6) months being considered as one whole year.\n\nUnless the parties provide for broader inclusions, the term one-half (1/2) month salary shall mean fifteen (15) days plus one-twelfth (1/12) of the 13th month pay and the cash equivalent of not more than five (5) days of service incentive leaves.\"\n\nIn this case, since there is no separate retirement benefit plan for managerial employees, the retirement benefits set forth under RA No. 7641 shall apply, i.e., at least one-half (1/2) month salary for every year of service of an employee who has reached the age of sixty (60) years or more, but not beyond sixty-five (65) years, and rendered at least five (5) years of service in the company. The retirement benefits of employees who met the age and length of service requirement under R.A. No. 7641 shall be exempt from withholding income tax by express provision of Section 32 (B) (6) (a) of the Tax Code, as amended.\n\nSince you are more than sixty (60) years of age and have more than five (5) years in the service of the company, you meet the age and length of service requirement under R.A. No. 7641. Thus, your retirement benefits received under RA No. 7641 are exempt from income tax, and consequently to the withholding tax.\n\nWith regard to the query as to whether or not Section 2.78.1 (B) (1) (a) (iv) of RR No. 2-98, as amended, applies to an employee who has previously availed of a tax exemption pursuant to retrenchment, we rule in the negative. Section 2.78.1 (B) (a) and (b) provides as follows:\n\n\"Sec. 2.78.1.  Withholding Tax on Compensation. \u2014\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(B) Exemption from withholding tax on compensation. \u2014 The following income payments are exempted from the requirement of withholding tax on compensation but may be subject to income tax depending on the nature/sources of income earned by the individual recipient. aScITE\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(1) Remunerations received as an incident of employment as follows:\n\n(a) Retirement benefits received under Republic Act 7641 and those received by officials and employees of private firms, whether individual or corporate, under reasonable private benefit plan maintained by the employer which meet the following requirements:\n\n(i) The plan must be reasonable;\n\n(ii) The benefit plan must be approved by the Bureau;\n\n(iii) The retiring official or employee must have been in the service of the same for at least ten (10) years and is not less than fifty (50) years of age at the time of retirement; and\n\n(iv) The retiring official or employee shall not have previously availed of the privilege under the retirement benefit plan of the same or another employer.\n\n(b) Any amount received by an official or employee or by his heirs from the employer due to death, sickness or other physical disability or for any cause beyond the control of the said official or employee, such as retrenchment, redundancy, or cessation of business.\n\nThe phrase 'for any cause beyond the control of the said official or employee' connotes involuntariness on the part of the official or employee. The separation from the service of the official or employee must not be asked for or initiated by him. The separation was not of his own making. Whether or not the separation is beyond the control of the official or employee, being essentially a question of fact, shall be determined on the basis of prevailing facts and circumstances. It shall be duly established by the employer by competent evidence which should be attached to the monthly return for the period in which the amount paid due to the involuntary separation was made.\n\nAmounts received by reason of involuntary separation remain exempt from income tax even if the official or the employee, at the time of separation, had rendered less than ten (10) years of service and/or is below fifty (50) years of age.\n\nAny payment made by an employer to an employee on account of dismissal, constitutes compensation regardless of whether the employer is legally bound by contract, statute, or otherwise, to make such payment.\"\n\nThe requirement that the employee must not have previously received retirement benefits pursuant to RA No. 7641 or from a reasonable private benefit plan of the same or another employer does not apply to a retiring employee who has previously received separation benefits and availed of a tax exemption pursuant to retrenchment. There is no double availment in case of separation benefit and retirement benefit considering that they are covered by separate provisions of the Tax Code.\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be ascertained that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R. DULAY\nCommissioner of Internal Revenue",

Emilio Aguinaldo,\nEDSA cor. Col. Bonny Serrano Rd.,\nQuezon City 1110, Metro Manila\n\nAttention: AAA\n_______________\n\nGentlemen :\n\nThis refers to your letter dated November 16, 2020 requesting on behalf of Armed Forces and Police Savings and Loan Association, Inc. (\"AFPSLAI\") for a confirmatory ruling on whether or not, a non-stock savings and loan association organized and operated exclusively for the mutual benefit of its members is subject to gross receipts tax (GRT) under Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 09-2016. HTcADC\n\nIt is represented that AFPSLAI with Taxpayer's Identification No. (TIN) 000-000-000-000 and Certificate of Registration No. OCN 8RC0000074188 dated January 7, 1997, is a corporation duly organized under the laws of the Philippines; that it is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under Company Registration No. 49060; and that a Certificate of Authority was issued by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) on C-067 in favor of AFPSLAI authorizing the latter to operate as a Non-Stock Savings and Loan Association (NSSLA) under Republic Act (RA) No. 8367.\n\nAFPSLAI is organized as a non-stock and non-profit savings and loan association and its primary purpose is to engage in the operations of a non-stock and non-profit savings and loan association in order to encourage industry, frugality, savings among the members. [1]\n\nIn reply, please be informed that Section 3 of Republic Act (RA) No. 8367 otherwise known as \"An Act Providing for the Regulation of the Organization and Operation of Non-Stock Savings and Loan Associations\" defines non-stock savings and loan associations (NSSLAs) as \"a non-stock, non-profit corporation engaged in the business of accumulating the savings of its members and using such accumulations for loans to members to service the needs of households by providing long term financing for home building and development and for personal finance.\" Section 4 thereof provides that NSSLA shall confine its membership to a well-defined group of persons and shall not transact business with the general public.\n\nSection 4101S.1 of BSP Manual of Regulations for NSSLA enumerates membership for NSSLAs as a well-defined group which consist of employees, officers, and directors of one company, including member-retirees; government employees belonging to the same department, branch, office; including member-retirees; and; immediate members of the families of the abovementioned, up to the second degree of consanguinity or affinity. Likewise, Section 4101S of the BSP Manual requires that a NSSLA shall accept deposit from and grant loans to its members only and shall not transact business with the general public.\n\nR.A. No. 8367 also provides tax exemption to NSSLAs as provided under Section 5, to wit:\n\n\"SECTION 5. TAX EXEMPTION. \u2014 An Association shall be exempt from payment of tax in respect to income it receives, including interest on its deposits with any bank: Provided, however, that income derived from any of its properties, real or personal, or any activity conducted for profit, regardless of the disposition thereof, is subject to the corresponding internal revenue taxes imposed under the National Internal Revenue Code. Interest earnings on deposits of members with Associations as well as the shares of its members from the net income of the Associations shall be exempt from income tax.\"\n\nAccordingly, Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) Revenue Memorandum Circular (RMC) No. 9-2016 was issued to clarify the taxability of NSSLAs for purposes of income tax, gross receipts tax and documentary stamp tax. The said RMC provides that NSSLAs are under the direct supervision and regulation of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) and, for regulatory purposes, they are classified as Non-Bank Financial Intermediaries (NBFIs) under the BSP Manual of Regulations. Hence, NSSLA is generally subject to GRT on income derived from its operations, unless otherwise exempted under special rules. The GRT imposed is under Section 122 of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) of 1997, as amended, i.e.,tax on other NBFIs.\n\nRelative thereto, Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 9-2004, entitled \"Implementing Certain Provisions of Republic Act No. 9238, Re-Imposing the Gross Receipts Tax (GRT) on Banks and Non-Bank Financial Intermediaries Performing Quasi-Banking Functions and Other Non-Bank Financial Intermediaries Beginning January 1, 2004\" defines NBFIs as follows:\n\n\"2.3. Non-bank Financial Intermediaries \u2014 shall refer to persons or entities whose principal functions include the lending, investing or placement of funds or evidences of indebtedness or equity deposited with them, acquired by them or otherwise coursed through them, either for their own account or for the account of others. This includes all entities regularly engaged in the lending of funds or purchasing of receivables or other obligations with funds obtained from the public through the issuance, endorsement or acceptance of debt instruments of any kind for their own account, or through the issuance of certificates of assignment or similar instruments with recourse, trust certificates, or of repurchase agreements, whether any of these means of obtaining funds from the public is done on a regular basis or only occasionally.\"\n\nFurther, in the case of City of Davao and Bella Linda N. Tanjili vs. Randy Allied Ventures, Inc.,G.R. No. 241697, July 29, 2019, the Supreme Court held that:\n\n\"In order to be considered as an NBFI under the National Internal Revenue Code, banking laws, and pertinent regulations, the following must concur:\n\na. The person or entity is authorized by the BSP to perform quasi-banking functions;\n\nb. The principal functions of said person or entity include the lending, investing or placement of funds or evidences of indebtedness or equity deposited to them, acquired by them, or otherwise coursed through them, either for their own account or for the account of others; and\n\nc. The person or entity must perform any of the following functions on a regular and recurring, not on an isolated basis, to wit:\n\n1. Receive funds from one (1) group of persons, irrespective of number, through traditional deposits, or issuance of debt or equity securities; and make available/lend these funds to another person or entity, and in the process acquire debt or equity securities;\n\n2. Use principally the funds received for acquiring various types of debt or equity securities;\n\n3. Borrow against, or lend on, or buy or sell debt or equity securities.\"\n\nClearly, the imposition of GRT is on NBFIs engaged in the lending of funds or purchasing of receivables or obligations with funds obtained from the public. On the other hand, RA No. 8367 and the BSP Manual of Regulations for NSSLA mandate that a NSSLA shall accept deposit from and grant loans to its members only and shall not transact business with the general public. Not only that, NSSLAs must be organized and operated exclusively for the mutual benefit of its members. RA No. 8367 requires that all funds received from members are accumulated to be utilized for the common benefit of the members by providing long term financing for home building and development and for personal finance. aScITE\n\nBased thereon, since AFPSLAI showed that it is a NSSLA, a non-profit organization, which obtains funds exclusively from its members and does not transact business with the general public, it is our considered view that GRT imposed under RMC No. 9-2016 on its lending activities is not warranted for as long as such transactions do not fall under the contemplated activities of a NBFI as defined by law and its rules and regulations.\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be disclosed that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R. DULAY\nCommissioner of Internal Revenue\n\n1. Amended Articles of Incorporation of the Armed Forces and Police Savings & Loan Association, Inc.",

(\"Philexcel\") to Intercredit Corporation (\"Intercredit\"), a non-resident foreign corporation based in the Island of Nevis, West Indies, are subject to 15% final withholding tax under Section 28 (B) (5) (b) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended. HTcADC\n\nThe facts, as can be drawn from the records, show that Philexcel is a domestic corporation duly registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under Company Registration No. ASO95-003663. Philexcel was originally incorporated as \"Philexcel Textile, Inc.\" before it changed its corporate name into \"Philexcel Industrial Park, Inc.\" on November 10, 1997 and later into \"Philexcel Business Park, Inc.\" on March 26, 2002.\n\nOn the other hand, Intercredit, is a non-resident foreign corporation domiciled in the Island of Nevis, West Indies. Per records of the SEC, the corporation was certified as not being registered as a corporation or partnership in the Philippines. [1] It appears that the Articles of Incorporation of Intercredit was originally filed with the Registrar of Companies in the British Virgin Islands on the 9th day of July 1993 under the name Masterton Enterprises Limited. The corporation was renamed Excel Textiles Inc. on or about the 20th day of July 1993, and was redomiciled to Nevis and renamed Intercredit Corporation on the 22nd day of October 1997. Amendments to the Articles were filed on the 3rd day of July 2013. [2] On July 24, 2013, the Inland Revenue Department of the Nevis Island Administration issued a certification stating that Intercredit Corporation is exempt from tax in Nevis as long as it does no business in Nevis in accordance with the terms of Section 122 (1) [3] of the Nevis Business Corporation Ordinance, 1984, as amended which states:\n\n\"Any corporation subject to this Ordinance which does no business in Nevis shall not be subject to any corporate tax, income tax, withholding tax, stamp tax, asset tax, exchange controls, or other fees or taxes based upon or measured by assets or income originating outside of Nevis or in connection with other activities outside of Nevis or in connection with matters of corporate administration which may occur in Nevis, except as provided in sections 6 and 7 of Part I of this Ordinance.\"\n\nOn June 26, 2013, Philexcel declared cash dividends in the total amount of Twenty One Million Five Hundred Thousand Pesos (P21,500,000.00) from the unrestricted retained earnings of the Corporation recorded in its financial statements, payable on September 1, 2013. Intercredit Corporation, at the time of the declaration of cash dividends, owns 22,495 shares in Philexcel with a par value of P100 per share corresponding to 99.98% of the total outstanding capital stock of the Corporation. [4]\n\nIn reply, please be informed that Section 28 (B) (5) (b) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, provides that \u2014\n\n\"(B) Tax on Nonresident Foreign Corporation. \u2014\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(5) Tax on Certain Incomes Received by a Nonresident Foreign Corporation. \u2014\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(b) Intercorporate Dividends. \u2014 A final withholding tax at the rate of fifteen percent (15%) is hereby imposed on the amount of cash and/or property dividends received from a domestic corporation, which shall be collected and paid as provided in Section 57(A) of this Code, subject to the condition that the country in which the non-resident foreign corporation is domiciled, shall allow a credit against the tax due from the non-resident foreign corporation taxes deemed to have been paid in the Philippines equivalent to twenty percent (20%),which represents the difference between the regular income tax of thirty-five percent (35%) and the fifteen percent (15%),on dividends as provided in this subparagraph: Provided, that effective January 1, 2009, the credit against the tax due shall be equivalent to fifteen percent (15%),which represents the difference between the regular income tax of thirty percent (30%) and the fifteen percent (15%) tax on dividends.\"\n\nUnder the said provision, it is provided that a final withholding tax at the lower rate of fifteen percent (15%) is imposed on cash dividends received by a non-resident foreign corporation from a domestic corporation, subject to the condition that the country in which the non-resident foreign corporation is domiciled shall allow a credit against the tax due from the non-resident foreign corporation taxes deemed to have been paid in the Philippines equivalent to fifteen percent (15%).In other words, the only condition for the application of the tax sparing credit is that the country-domicile of the recipient corporation allows a credit against the tax due from non-resident foreign corporation. [5]\n\nIn the instant case, Nevis Island does not impose any income tax on Intercredit Corporation. The Supreme Court, in the case of Commissioner of Internal Revenue vs. Wander Philippines, Inc.,[160 SCRA 573 (1998)] has ruled that exemption from taxes by the country of domicile of the non-resident corporate stockholder on the dividends received is sufficient basis for the applicability of the 15% tax rate. Thus:\n\n\"While it may be true that claims for refund are construed strictly against the claimant, nevertheless, the fact that Switzerland did not impose any tax on the dividends received by Glaxo from the Philippines should be considered as a full satisfaction of the given condition. For, as aptly stated by respondent court, to deny private respondent the privilege to withhold only 15% tax provided for under Presidential Decree No. 369 amending Section 24(b)(1) of the Tax Code, would run counter to the very spirit and intent of said law and definitely will adversely affect foreign corporation's interest here and discourage them from investing capital in our country.\"\n\nThus, the exemption from taxes in the country of domicile of non-resident corporate stockholder on the dividends received is sufficient for the applicability of the 15% tax rate.\n\nSuch being the case, this Office holds that the cash dividends declared on June 26, 2013 to be paid by Philexcel to Intercredit Corporation, a non-resident foreign corporation domiciled in Nevis, West Indies payable on or before September 1, 2013, are subject to the 15% final withholding tax as prescribed under Section 28 (B) (5) (b) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended.

However, if upon investigation, it will be disclosed that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void.\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R.

BBB; and\n\n2. CCC.\n\nAs represented, BBB, sixty (60) years of age, last held the position of __________ of Tractebel, Inc. (the \"Company\").

She was hired on November 16, 2007 and served the Company for eleven (11) years.\n\nThe Company has no existing retirement plan or policy providing for retirement benefits of its employees.\n\nIn reply, please be informed that Section 1 of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 7641 provides, viz.:\n\n\"SEC. 1. Article 287 of Presidential Decree No. 442, as amended, otherwise known as the Labor Code of the Philippines, is hereby amended to read as follows:\n\nART. 287. Retirement. \u2014 Any employee may be retired upon reaching the retirement age established in the collective bargaining agreement or other applicable employment contract. In case of retirement, the employee shall be entitled to receive such retirement benefits as he may have earned under existing laws and any collective bargaining agreement and other agreements: Provided, however, That an employee's retirement benefits under any collective bargaining and other agreements shall not be less than those provided herein.\n\nIn the absence of a retirement plan or agreement providing for retirement benefits of employees in the establishment, an employee upon reaching the age of sixty (60) years or more, but not beyond sixty-five (65) years which is hereby declared the compulsory retirement age, who has served at least five (5) years in the said establishment, may retire and shall be entitled to retirement pay equivalent to at least one-half (1/2) month salary for every year of service, a fraction of at least six (6) months being considered as one whole year.\n\nUnless the parties provide for broader inclusions, the term one-half (1/2) month salary shall mean fifteen (15) days plus one-twelfth (1/12) of the 13th month pay and the cash equivalent of not more than five (5) days of service incentive leaves.\"\n\nPursuant to the above provision, in the absence of a retirement plan or other agreement providing for the retirement benefits of employees in the establishment, the retirement benefits set forth under R.A. No. 7641 shall apply, i.e., at least one-half (1/2) month salary for every year of service of an employee who has reached the age of sixty (60) years or more, but not beyond sixty-five (65) years, and rendered at least five (5) years of service in the Company.\n\nConsidering that Tractebel, Inc. has no retirement plan or policy providing for retirement benefits of its employees, and that the abovementioned employees are sixty (60) years of age and have more than five (5) years in the service of the Company, the retirement benefits provided in R.A. No. 7641 shall apply.\n\nBy express provision of Section 32 (B) (6) (a) of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended (Tax Code), the retirement benefits of employees who meet the age and length of service requirement under R.A. No. 7641 shall be exempt from withholding tax.\n\nTHEREFORE, this Office hereby holds that the retirement benefits to be paid by Tractebel, Inc. to BBB and CCC shall be exempt from income tax and consequently, to the withholding tax pursuant to Section 32 (B) (6) (a) of the Tax Code.\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be ascertained that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void. CAIHTE\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R.

De Jesus, CESO V\nRegional Director\n\nGentlemen :\n\nThis refers to your letter dated September 17, 2020 requesting on behalf of Department of Environment and Natural Resources-Mines and Geosciences Bureau (DENR-MGB) for clarification on whether the imposable withholding tax for the procurement of service of the consultant on the feasibility study, planning and structural design is 10-15% based on Section 2.4.6 of Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 11-2018 or 2% based on Section 2.C.1 of RR No. 11-2018.\n\nBased on your representations, DENR-MGB has pending procurement for consultancy services for the conduct of feasibility study, planning and structural design for the construction of Gabion Dam in Mogpog River in Marinduque; that you will acquire the service of Green Development Solutions, Inc. (GDSI), whose Line of Business under its Certificate of Registration with the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) is Code no. 7421 \u2014 Architectural, Engineering Activities, Technical Consultancy; that the said company claims that based on Section 3 (E) of Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 6-2001, they should be classified as General Engineering Contractors, therefore, the imposable withholding tax is 2%. Hence, this request.\n\nIn reply, please be informed that Section 2.57.2 (C) of Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 2-98, as amended by RR No. 11-2018, states that:\n\n\"(C) Income payments to certain contractors \u2014 On gross payments to the following contractors, whether individual or corporate \u2014 Two percent (2%).\"\n\nThe above provision categorically enumerated the types of contractor to which withholding tax of 2% is imposable, including therein both General Engineering Contractors and Specialty Contractors.\n\nIn BIR Ruling No. 006-03 dated August 15, 2003, this office ruled that for purpose of withholding tax, an independent firm of quantity surveyors, cost engineers and construction cost specialists, is considered a specialty contractor. In the said ruling, the company renders quantity surveying services in building and other civil works projects including, but not limited to, initial design, tendering procedures and contract arrangements, cost studies and planning, Master development programming, tender contract analysis and report, construction progress financial statement preparation, advisory contract administration, valuation of construction work in progress and cost and material supervision in each and every work phase of construction, which services pertain to the performance of construction work requiring special skill. Notwithstanding the fact that the company does not perform actual construction work, it was considered a specialty contractor, because its principal contracting business involves the use of specialized building trades or crafts. CAIHTE\n\nAccordingly, said ruling states that as a specialty contractor, the professional fees that the company receives for quantity surveying services are subject to creditable withholding tax at the rate of 2% in accordance with RR No. 2-98, as amended.\n\nBased on the foregoing, this Office opines that GDSI is considered as specialty contractor since its line of business requires special skills, such as feasibility study, planning and structural design, generally carrying activities in conjunction with and related to any of the services of a specialty contractor. Hence, all income payments received by GDSI as specialty contractor are subject to creditable withholding tax at the rate of 2% pursuant to Sec. 2.57.2 (C) (3) of RR No. 2-98, as amended by RR No. 11-2018.\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be disclosed that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R. DULAY\nCommissioner of Internal Revenue",

Guerrero Street\nBrgy. 687 Zone 76, District V\nMalate, Manila 1010\n\nAttention: AAA\n_______________\n\nGentlemen :\n\nThis refers to your letter dated January 14, 2019, requesting on behalf of SYMPA INTERNATIONAL CONSOLIDATED CORPORATION for exemption from value-added tax (VAT) on its sale and distribution of roasted whole beans and ground coffee, pursuant to Section 109 (1) (A) of the National Internal Revenue Code (Tax Code) of 1997, as amended. HTcADC\n\nDocuments submitted show that SYMPA INTERNATIONAL CONSOLIDATED CORPORATION, with Taxpayer's Identification Number (TIN) 000-000-000-000, is a corporation organized and existing under Philippine laws; that it is duly registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under SEC Reg. No. AS95003962 dated April 21, 1995; and that as shown in its Amended Articles of Incorporation, its primary purpose is to engage in, operate, conduct and maintain the business of manufacturing, exporting, buying, selling or otherwise dealing in, at wholesale and retail goods such as coffee beans and other agricultural products and other related goods of the same nature, and any and all equipment, materials, supplies used or employed in or related to manufacture of such finished products.\n\nSYMPA INTERNATIONAL CONSOLIDATED CORPORATION was issued a Certificate of Product Registration on March 26, 2020 by the Food and Drug Administration under FDA Registration No. FR-4000005913615, valid until March 26, 2022, as manufacturer of 100% Natural Roasted Coffee (Whole Beans) with License to Operate (LTO) No. CFRR-NCR-FM-4559 dated July 14, 2016, valid until April 12, 2021.\n\nIn reply, please be informed that Section 109 (1) (A) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, provides for the exemption from VAT on the sale of roasted coffee beans and ground coffee which are packed in ordinary paper, plastic or aluminum foil bags. The aforesaid provision reads, viz.:\n\n\"SEC. 109. Exempt Transactions. \u2014 (1) Subject to the provisions of subsection (2) hereof, the following transactions shall be exempt from the value-added tax:\n\nA) Sale or importation of agricultural and marine food products in their original state, livestock and poultry of kind generally used as, or yielding or producing foods for human consumption; and breeding stock and genetic materials therefor.\n\nProducts classified under this paragraph and paragraph (a) shall be considered in their original state even if they have undergone the simple processes of preparation or preservation for the market, such as freezing, drying, salting, broiling, roasting, smoking or stripping. Polished and/or husked rice, corn grits, raw cane sugar and molasses, and ordinary salt shall be considered in their original state.\"\n\nBased on the above-cited provision, the importation and distribution/sale of agricultural products in its original state for human consumption, are considered exempt from 12% VAT pursuant to Section 109 (1) (A) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended. Agricultural products are considered in its original state even if these have undergone the simple process of preparation or preservation for the market, such as freezing, drying, salting, broiling, roasting, or stripping. The type of processing is limited to the aforementioned simple processes. Otherwise, the same may no longer be considered agricultural product in its original state. Moreover, the VAT exemption is limited in application \u2014 it refers only to food products which are intended for human consumption.\n\nIn view of the foregoing, since roasted coffee beans and ground coffee are considered agricultural products in its original state, the importation and distribution/sale thereof by SYMPA INTERNATIONAL CONSOLIDATED CORPORATION are exempt from the twelve percent (12%) VAT pursuant to Section 109 (1) (A) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended. It is understood that the sale of such product must be covered by valid and existing License to Operate issued by the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be disclosed that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R.

HTcADC\n\nBackground:\n\nThe late BBB died intestate on July 11, 2012 leaving behind two (2) illegitimate children as her legal heirs. On May 8, 2014, an Extra-judicial Settlement of Estate covering real properties and cash were executed and filed with the BIR for processing. Consequently, Certificates Authorizing Registration (eCARs) bearing eCAR Nos. 201600017945 and 201300122870 were issued on January 11, 2017.\n\nThereafter, the heirs discovered that the deceased left behind cash and shares of stock as additional assets for which Supplemental Extra-judicial Settlement of Estate was executed by her heirs on June 1, 2017. When presented for processing to the BIR-RDO No. 50, the said office required the production of the stock certificates for the shareholdings. However, the stock brokerage holding the shares in trust for the deceased issued a certification that said shares are not covered by certificates as the same are electronically traded. Fearing more delays, the heirs decided to first process the cash component of the estate and accordingly, the same was processed for which eCAR No. C-2018-050-010752-M was issued on May 31, 2018.\n\nPresently, there are seven (7) shareholdings left behind by BBB in the form of scripless shares of stock or shares traded electronically and thus, with no stock certificates. Said scripless shares are held in trust for the deceased by her stock broker IGC Securities, Inc. The only proof of the deceased's shareholdings is the Certification issued by IGC Securities, Inc. stating that BBB is the beneficial owner of the stocks in various investee companies, number of shares, unit price and market values of said stocks.\n\nOn October 6, 2020, additional documents were submitted in the form of Certifications issued by Stock Transfer Service, Inc. and BDO Unibank, Inc. certifying that BBB is a stockholder of various investee companies and stating the Certificate Number and number of shares.\n\nIn reply, please be informed that Section 97 of the National Internal Revenue Code (Tax Code) of 1997, as amended, provides, to wit:\n\n\"SEC. 97. Payment of Tax Antecedent to the Transfer of Shares, Bonds or Rights. \u2014 There shall not be transferred to any new owner in the books of any corporation, sociedad anonima,partnership, business, or industry organized or established in the Philippines any share, obligation, bond or right by way of gift inter vivos or mortis causa,legacy or inheritance, unless a certification from the Commissioner that the taxes fixed in this Title and due thereon have been paid is shown.\"\n\nFrom the afore-cited provision of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, it is mandated that no transfer of any shares of stocks, by way of inheritance, to any new owner shall be made in the books of any corporation established in the Philippines, unless a certification from the Commissioner that the estate taxes due thereon have been paid is shown. The said certification is being issued in the form of an eCertificate Authorizing Registration (eCAR)/Tax Clearance Certificate (TCL). [1] Anent thereto, Revenue Memorandum Circular (RMC) No. 39-2015 dated December 11, 2014, otherwise known as the Updated BIR Citizen's Charter requires that for every transfer of shares of stock, a photocopy of the certificate of stock, among others, must be submitted.\n\nIn the instant case, the presentation of the Certification issued by IGC Securities, Inc.,as well as the Certifications issued by Stock Transfer Service, Inc. and BDO Unibank, Inc.,is sufficient compliance with the above requirement to process the issuance of eCAR/TCL for the transfer of the subject scripless shares.\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be disclosed that the facts as represented are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R.

HTcADC\n\nIt is represented that TSQ, with Taxpayer Identification Number 000-000-000-000, is a single proprietorship registered as VAT taxpayer with Revenue District Office No. 043. It is engaged in the business of providing drafting services and is owned and managed by BBB. On February 1, 2018, TSQ entered into a Master Service Agreement with Mabuhay Telecom, LLC (\"Mabuhay\"), a non-resident corporation based in the United States of America (USA) and with business address at 6212 Pine Meadow Lane, McKinney, Texas 75070, to render drafting services for individual work projects in the USA to be subcontracted by Mabuhay to TSQ. In consideration for its services, TSQ will be paid in US dollars for each project awarded by Mabuhay. The Agreement remains valid until terminated in writing by both parties.\n\nSince the effectivity of the Agreement, TSQ has been awarded work projects and is expected to regularly receive work orders from Mabuhay and be paid in US dollars for future drafting services.\n\nBased on the foregoing facts, you now request for confirmation that all payments received by TSQ for providing drafting services to Mabuhay pursuant to the Agreement are subject to VAT at zero percent (0%) rate pursuant to Section 108 (B) (2) of the NIRC, as amended.\n\nIn support of your request, you submitted the following documents:\n\n1.

Valero Sts.\nSalcedo Village, 1227 Makati City\n\nAttention: AAA\n_______________\n\nGentlemen :\n\nThis refers to your letter dated January 31, 2020 requesting on behalf of your client, DAVAO LIGHT AND POWER COMPANY, INC. (\"the Company\") for confirmation of your opinion that for income tax purposes, the Company is allowed to write off and claim as deduction the remaining book value of a backup power plant which has become obsolete after it is demolished by the Company. HTcADC\n\nAs represented, the Company, with Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) 0000-000-000-000, is duly incorporated and registered under Philippine laws. It is engaged in the business of power distribution. Pursuant to such business, the Company had erected power plants used in generating power. One such back-up power plant is the integrated power facility, known as the Bajada power plant, located in J.P. Laurel St.,Bajada, Davao City, and its substations. For a number of years, the said power plant and its substations had been used by the Company for power generation. However, the Company has determined that the power plant is no longer producing its desired output. The said facility and its associated substations are unfit for continued use in the generation and production of power. In other words, it has become obsolete. Unless rehabilitated, the plant will continue to operate at a loss. The cost to rehabilitate the power plant would entail a substantial capital outlay which would likely exceed any projected revenue from the plant's rehabilitation. Thus, the continued operation of the power plant is no longer economically viable. Accordingly, it was decided in a special board meeting held on October 29, 2018 that the commercial operation of the power plant shall be discontinued and abandoned permanently. The power plant and substations will eventually be dismantled and disposed or destroyed in accordance with the regulations of the BIR.\n\nThe Company expects a loss in the value of the facility arising from the eventual destruction of the same. The plant facility and its substations, consist of equipment, building, building improvements, land improvements and substation equipment with a total cost of P674,454,727.11. The loss would amount to the carrying value of the facility, consisting of this cost less the accumulated depreciation, as declared by the Company in its books. Any proceeds to be derived from the sale of the scrap materials generated from the demolition of the facility will be recognized by the Company as its income.\n\nIn reply, please be informed that the deductibility of losses is governed by the pertinent provisions of the Tax Code as well as its implementing regulations. Specifically, Section 34 (D) (1) of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended (Tax Code), provides:\n\n\"Section 34. Deductions from Gross Income. \u2014 Except for taxpayers earning compensation income arising from personal services rendered under an employer-employee relationship where no deductions shall be allowed under this Section other than under Subsection (M) hereof, in computing taxable income subject to income tax under Subsections 24(A);25(A);26; 27(A),(B) and (C);and 28(A)(1),there shall be allowed the following deductions from gross income:\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(D) Losses. \u2014\n\n(1) In General. \u2014 Losses actually sustained during the taxable year and not compensated for by insurance or other forms of indemnity shall be allowed as deductions:\n\n(a) If incurred in trade, profession or business;\n\n(b) Of property connected with the trade, business or profession, if the loss arises from fires, storms, shipwreck, or other casualties, or from robbery, theft or embezzlement.\n\nThe Secretary of Finance, upon recommendation of the Commissioner, is hereby authorized to promulgate rules and regulations prescribing, among other things, the time and manner by which the taxpayer shall submit a declaration of loss sustained from casualty or from robbery, theft or embezzlement during the taxable year: Provided, however, That the time limit to be so prescribed in the rules and regulations shall not be less than thirty (30) days nor more than ninety (90) days from the date of discovery of the casualty or robbery, theft or embezzlement giving rise to the loss.\n\n(c) No loss shall be allowed as a deduction under this Subsection if at the time of the filing of the return, such loss has been claimed as a deduction for estate tax purposes in the estate tax return.\n\nxxx xxx xxx.\"\n\nIn relation thereto, Section 98 of Revenue Regulations (\"RR\") No. 02 provides:\n\n\"Section 98. Loss of Useful Value. \u2014 When through some change in business conditions, the usefulness in the business of some or all of the capital assets is suddenly terminated, so that the taxpayer discontinues the business or discards such assets permanently from use of such business, he may claim as deduction the actual loss sustained. In determining the amount of the loss, adjustment must be made, however, for improvements, depreciation and the salvage value of the property. This exception to the rule requiring a sale or other disposition of property in order to establish a loss requires proof of some unforeseen cause by reason of which the property has been prematurely discarded, as, for example, where an increase in the cost or change in the manufacture of any products makes it necessary to abandon such manufacture, to which special machinery is exclusively devoted, or where new legislation directly or indirectly makes the continued profitable use of the property impossible. This exception does not extend to a case where the useful life of property terminates solely as a result of those gradual processes for which depreciation allowances are authorized. It does not apply to inventories or to other than capital assets. The exception applies to buildings only when they are permanently abandoned or permanently devoted to a radically different use, and to machinery only when its use as such is permanently abandoned. Any loss to be deductible under this exception must be charged off in the books and fully explained in returns of income.\"\n\nApplying the above provisions of the law and its implementing revenue regulations, when assets are abandoned or discarded because the continued use is no longer beneficial to the business, the related loss may be claimed as deduction. Accordingly, pursuant to the provisions of Section 34 (D) (1) of the Tax Code, and Section 98 of RR No. 02, the remaining book value of the Bajada Power Plant and its substations which had become obsolete and which will eventually be dismantled shall be allowed as deduction for income tax purposes when the facility is demolished.\n\nHowever, please note that Section 110 of RR No. 2 provides for the conditions under which obsolescence could become an item of deduction from gross income. Thus, we quote the said section in its entirety as follows: aScITE\n\n\"With respect to physical property the whole or any portion of which is clearly shown by the taxpayer as being affected by economic conditions that will result in its being abandoned at a future date prior to the end of its normal useful life, so that depreciation deductions alone are insufficient to return the cost (or other basis) at the end of its economic term of usefulness, a reasonable deduction for obsolescence, in addition to depreciation, may be allowed in accordance with the facts obtaining with respect to each item of property concerning with a claim for obsolescence is made. No deductions for obsolescence will be permitted merely because, in the opinion of a taxpayer, the property may become obsolete at some later date. This allowance will be confined to such portion of the property on which obsolescence is definitely shown to be sustained and cannot be held applicable to an entire property unless all portions thereof are affected by the conditions to which obsolescence is found to be due.\" (emphasis supplied)\n\nThus, while obsolescence is, by nature, allowed as a deduction, the determination of the factual case leading to the determination of whether or not there is obsolescence is a factual issue that is beyond the jurisdiction of a ruling to confirm.\n\nBased on the foregoing, we therefore confirm that:\n\n1. When assets are abandoned or discarded because the continued use is no longer beneficial to the business, the related loss may be claimed as deduction, pursuant to Section 34 (D) (1) of the Tax Code, in relation to Section 98 of RR No. 02; and\n\n2. The remaining book value of the Bajada Power Plant and its substations which had become obsolete and which will eventually be dismantled shall be allowed as deduction for income tax purposes when the facility is demolished. This is, however, subject to compliance with the conditions set forth in Section 110 of RR No. 02 under which obsolescence could become an item of deduction from gross income.\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be disclosed that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R.

Quezon Avenue, Diliman\nQuezon City\n\nAttention: AAA\n_______________\n\nGentlemen :\n\nThis refers to your letter dated December 10, 2020 requesting for a legal opinion on the applicable tax rates on the backwages awarded to the National Power Corporation (NPC)'s former employees and on the ten percent (10%) attorney's lien that were awarded in the case of NPC Drivers and Mechanics Association (NPC-DAMA), et al. v. NPC, et al. [1] which was subsequently validated by the Commission on Audit (COA). HTcADC\n\nIt is represented that on September 26, 2006, the Supreme Court declared null and without effect National Power Board (NPB) Resolution Nos. 2002-124 and 2002-125, thereby giving NPC employees, who were illegally terminated on January 31, 2003, the right to (i) reinstatement, or (ii) separation pay in lieu of reinstatement (pursuant to a validly approved separation program);plus backwages, wage adjustments, and other benefits accruing from January 31, 2003 to the date of reinstatement (less amount of separation benefits previously received under the null NPB Resolutions).However, due to reorganization of NPC in 2003, reinstatement was not possible.\n\nAlso, by virtue of the September 26, 2006 decision, 10% Attorney's lien on the amounts recoverable by the illegally terminated employees was also ordered to be entered in the records of the case.\n\nHence, this request for opinion on the applicable tax rates.\n\nIn reply, please be informed that backwages and the amount representing unpaid salaries are remuneration for services which are subject to income tax, and, consequently, to the withholding tax on wages. The employer is required to withhold the income tax corresponding to the income to be received as backwages by an employee found to be illegally dismissed. However, the illegally dismissed employee is accorded special treatment, i.e.,he is allowed to allocate or spread his backwages, allowances and benefits through the years he was dismissed from service, having been denied payment of his wages when they were due because of circumstances not of his own making and, therefore, beyond his control. [2]\n\nSection 2.57 (B) of Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 2-98, as amended by RR No. 11-2018, provides as follows:\n\n\"Section 2.57. Withholding of Tax at Source. \u2014\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(B) Creditable Withholding Tax. \u2014 Under the creditable withholding tax system, taxes withheld on certain income payments are intended to equal or at least approximate the tax due of the payee on said income. The income recipient is still required to file an income tax return, as prescribed in Sections 51 and 52 of the NIRC, as amended, to report the income and/or pay the difference between the tax withheld and the tax due on the income. Taxes withheld on income payments covered by the expanded withholding tax (referred to in Sec. 2.57.2 of these regulations) and compensation income (referred to in Sec. 2.78 also of these regulations) are creditable in nature.\" (emphasis supplied)\n\nWhether an employee found to be illegally dismissed is reinstated or opts for separation, he is required to report such income (backwages) for the years he was dismissed from service, as he files and pays his corresponding income tax thereon by allocating or spreading his backwages, allowances and benefits through the years from the time of his dismissal to actual reinstatement or actual separation (if he opts for separation instead of reinstatement),as the case may be, crediting in the process the corresponding income tax withheld from said wage payments. [3]\n\nThus, in computing the NPC former employees' net income tax, the amount deducted and withheld for the taxable years they were illegally dismissed from service by NPC shall be allowed as a credit against the tax imposed under Section 24 (A) of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended pursuant to Section 79 (C) (2) of the same Code. Moreover, they are allowed to deduct personal and additional exemptions during the years they were illegally dismissed in accordance with Section 35 (A) and (B) also of the same Code.\n\nSuch being the case, said backwages and amount representing their unpaid salaries are subject to income tax and consequently, to withholding tax on wages pursuant to Section 79, Chapter XII, Title II of the NIRC of 1997, as amended and as implemented by Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 2-98, as amended by RR No. 11-2018. NPC shall apply the withholding tax rate as provided thereunder for the years 2003-2007.\n\nOn the other hand, the amount representing the 13th month pay of the NPC former employees received from the years 2003-2007 is exempt from income tax, the same being treated as an exclusion from the gross income under Section 32 (B) (7) (e) of the NIRC of 1997, as amended.\n\nAs regards the attorney's lien, which is the 10% charging lien on the amount recoverable by the NPC's former employees from NPC, the same shall also be subject to income tax, and consequently to the applicable creditable withholding tax, based on the prevailing rates at the time when such lien was paid to them.\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be ascertained that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void. aScITE\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R.

(DMC-UPDI) is not subject to Capital Gains Tax (CGT) imposed under Section 24 (D) (1) of the National Internal Revenue Code (\"Tax Code\") of 1997, as amended, and Documentary Stamp Tax (DST) under Section 196 of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended. HTcADC\n\nIt is represented that Davao City was hit by a series of strong earthquakes in the month of October 2019. Due to such, various Magallanes Residences condominium buildings constructed by DMC-UPDI suffered structural damages and were deemed unfit for occupancy. On December 15, 2019, another earthquake hit Davao City and upon inspection by the City Building Office, Magallanes Residences Condominium Toledo building was also deemed unfit for occupancy as major structural damages were likewise discovered prompting a series of negotiations between the unit owners of Magallanes Residences Condominium and DMC-UPDI. Eventually, DMC-UPDI agreed to enter into a buy-back transaction with the aforesaid unit owners whereas DMC-UPDI will purchase back the condominium units from their owners at 125% of the total contract price by which the unit owners had purchased the aforesaid units.\n\nDue to the fear of the possible dangers that may befall if you continue to live in a building that is structurally compromised, you accepted the offer from DMC-UPDI to purchase back from you your condominium unit.\n\nThus, in order to help diminish any further costs that you may incur, you seek confirmation that the aforesaid buy-back transaction is exempt from CGT and DST.\n\nIn reply, please be informed that Section 24 (D) (1) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, provides:\n\n\"Sec. 24. Income Tax Rates. \u2014\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(D) Capital Gains from Sale of Real Property. \u2014\n\n(1) In General. \u2014 The provisions of Section 39(B) notwithstanding, a final tax of six percent (6%) based on the gross selling price or current fair market value as determined in accordance with Section 6(E) of this Code, whichever is higher, is hereby imposed upon capital gains presumed to have been realized from the sale,exchange, or other disposition of real property located in the Philippines, classified as capital assets, including pacto de retro sales and other forms of conditional sales, by individuals, including estates and trusts: Provided, That the tax liability, if any, on gains from sales or other dispositions of real property to the government or any of its political subdivisions or agencies or to government-owned or controlled corporations shall be determined either under Section 24 (A) or under this Subsection, at the option of the taxpayer.\" (Emphasis supplied)\n\nWhat is involved in this case is a sale of the condominium unit from you, the seller, to DMC-UPDI, which is the buyer. Thus, the subject transaction is subject to CGT regardless of whether a gain was in fact realized considering that Section 24 (D) (1) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, imposes CGT upon capital gains which is presumed to have been realized.\n\nAlso, the buy-back transaction, being a disposition of real property under Section 24 (D) (1) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, is likewise subject to the documentary stamp taxes imposed in Section 188 and Section 196 of the same Code. (BIR Ruling No. OT-019-20)\n\nAs repeatedly held by the Supreme Court, \"laws granting exemption from tax are construed strictissimi juris against the taxpayer and liberally in favor of the taxing power. Taxation is the rule and exemption is the exception. The law does not look with favor on tax exemptions and that he who would seek to be thus privileged must justify it by words too plain to be mistaken and too categorical to be misinterpreted.\" [1]\n\nPlease be guided accordingly.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.)

HTcADC\n\nIt is represented that the COMELEC is an independent Constitutional Commission whose primary mandate under the 1987 Constitution is to enforce and administer all laws and regulations relative to the conduct of an election, plebiscite, initiative, referendum, and recall. In relation thereto, the COMELEC will administer the 2022 Automated National Elections. In preparation to the said elections, the COMELEC started its bidding process for the procurement of goods and services since September 2020. The goods and services that have been procured and/or to be procured by the COMELEC in relation to the 2022 Automated National Elections are as follows:\n\n1. Automated Election System (AES) Certification by an International Certification Entity (ICE);\n\n2. AES groups/committees and election supplies and materials (accountable and non-accountable);\n\n3. Ballot Boxes;\n\n4. Ballot Paper Rolls and Marking Pens;\n\n5. Ballot Papers, Printing of Official Ballots (OB) and other Accountable and Non-Accountable Forms;\n\n6. Ballot printing facilities, and other related ballot goods and services;\n\n7. OB Packaging;\n\n8. Transport and Delivery of Ballot Boxes;\n\n9. Central Server, Transparency Server, Back-up Sever and other equipment and services needed in Election Results Transmission Solutions, Management Related Services (ERSTSMRS);\n\n10. Command and Media Center;\n\n11. Deployment Services;\n\n12. Election Management System (EMS);\n\n13. External Batteries;\n\n14. I-Buttons with handle;\n\n15. Laptops, Printers and USB key(s) for Canvassing and Consolidation System (CCS) and other CCS items;\n\n16. National Technical Support Center (NTSC) related goods and services;\n\n17. Optical Mark Reader or Optical Scan with EMS and other related requirements;\n\n18. Printing with Toners;\n\n19. Printing Services for Election Day Computerized Voter's List (EDCVL);\n\n20. Reverse Logistics of Equipment, Peripherals, Forms, Supplies;\n\n21. Secure Digital (SD) Card Write-Once-Read-Many (WORM);\n\n22. SD Card Main;\n\n23. SD Card Duplicators;\n\n24. SD Card Readers and Memory Card Readers;\n\n25. Technical Support;\n\n26. Thermal Papers;\n\n27. USB Tokens;\n\n28. Voter Registration and Verification Project (VRVP) related goods and services;\n\n29. Warehousing Services; and\n\n30. Other automated election-related goods and services as the COMELEC may deem necessary.\n\nIn view thereof, you now request for confirmation that the local procurements as well as importation of goods and services are subject to zero percent (0%) value-added tax (VAT) under the NIRC of 1997, as amended, pursuant to RA No. 8436, as amended by RA No. 9369, as cited in the Decision of the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA)-First Division in the case entitled: Smartmatic-Tim Corporation vs. Commissioner of Internal Revenue [1] which was eventually affirmed by CTA En Banc in CTA En Banc No. 1480. [2]\n\nIn reply, please be informed that RA No. 8436, as amended by RA No. 9369, provides for the COMELEC's exemption from taxes on its procurement of goods and services in relation to the automated elections, viz.:\n\n\"SEC. 12. Procurement of Equipment and Materials. \u2014 To achieve the purpose of this Act, the Commission is authorized to procure, in accordance with existing laws, by purchase, lease, rent or other forms of acquisition, supplies, equipment, materials, software, facilities and other services, from local or foreign sources free from taxes and import duties, subject to accounting and auditing rules and regulations. With respect to the May 10, 2010 elections and succeeding electoral exercises, the system procured must have demonstrated capability and been successfully used in a prior electoral exercise here or abroad. Participation in the 2007 pilot exercise shall not be conclusive of the system's fitness.\" (Underscoring supplied)\n\nIn view of the foregoing and as held in BIR Ruling No. 1242-2018 dated October 12, 2018, this Office is of the opinion that the COMELEC is exempt from the 12% VAT on its local purchases of goods and services as well as VAT on its importation of goods and services that will be used in the automated national and local elections. Accordingly, the suppliers/sellers of goods and services to the COMELEC cannot shift or pass on any VAT to COMELEC on the latter's purchases of goods and services [3] in pursuance to 2022 Automated National Elections. aScITE\n\nIt must be emphasized, however, that the exemption of the COMELEC from VAT on its purchase of goods as well as its procured services are limited only to its purchases and/or importation of goods and services enumerated above during the period beginning September 2020 until completion of the post-election activities; provided further, that the aforesaid purchases and/or importation of goods and services will be used in, or directly related to, the conduct of the 2022 Automated National Elections. [4]\n\nConsequently, any purchase of goods and services directly related to the 2022 Automated National Elections will not be subject to the 5% final VAT in accordance with Section 114 (C) of the NIRC of 1997, as amended, and as implemented by Section 4.114 (2) (a) of Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 16-2005, as amended by RR No. 13-2018, to wit: [5]\n\n\"Sec. 4.114-2. Withholding of VAT on Government Money Payments. \u2014 (a) The government or any of its political subdivisions, instrumentalities or agencies, including government-owned or controlled corporations (GOCCs) shall, before making payment on account of each purchase of goods and/or of services which are subject to the value-added tax imposed in Secs. 106 and 108 of this Code, deduct and withhold a final value-added tax at the rate of five percent (5%) of the gross payment thereof.\"\n\nHowever, purchases of goods and services not related to the said election shall be subject to the above-preceding provision.\n\nIt is worth noting that Article 8 of the New Civil Code enjoins adherence to judicial precedents. The law requires courts to follow a rule already established in a final decision of the Supreme Court. [6] However, the decisions of CTA are not given the same level of recognition. [7] At the most, decisions of the lower courts only have a persuasive effect. [8] Therefore, the pronouncement in CTA En Banc No. 1480 [9] as to the treatment of purchases of goods and services from local and foreign sources in relation to automated elections as zero percent (0%) VAT cannot, by any stretch of imagination, be sustained.\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation it will be disclosed that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void.\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R. DULAY\nCommissioner of Internal Revenue\n\n1.

HTcADC\n\nDocuments submitted show that Chelsea Shipping Corporation, with Tax Identification No. 000-000-000-000, is a domestic corporation registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under Company Registration No. CS200628661; that it is duly accredited by the Maritime Industry Authority (MARINA) to engage in domestic shipping business per MARINA Certification dated September 28, 2018 valid until October 10, 2021; and that Chelsea Shipping Corporation is currently importing one (1) Unit Auxiliary Working Barge with 50 Tons Crane; that MARINA has approved the importation of the above barge in its letter dated January 6, 2018 addressed to Chelsea Shipping Corporation; and that per Sworn Statement dated October 28, 2020 executed by Ignacia S. Braga IV, Vice President-Finance of Chelsea Shipping Corporation, the subject cargo vessel is not being manufactured domestically, in comparable quality, technology and at reasonable price and that the said cargo vessel will be used exclusively by the company operations.\n\nIn support of its request for exemption, Chelsea Shipping Corporation has submitted the following documents:\n\n1. Certified true copies of the SEC Certificate of Registration, Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws;\n\n2. BIR Certificate of Registration;\n\n3. Certificate of Registration with MARINA;\n\n4. Certified true copy of the MARINA Authority to Import;\n\n5. Sworn Statement dated October 28, 2020.\n\nIn reply, please be informed that an Auxiliary Working Barge with 50 Tons Crane falls under the classification of cargo vessels. Section 109 (1) (T) of the NIRC of 1997, as amended, provides that the importation, among others, of a cargo vessel destined for domestic trade operations shall be exempt from VAT, viz.:\n\n\"Sec. 109. Exempt Transactions. \u2014\n\n(1) Subject to the provisions of Subsection (2) hereof, the following transactions shall be exempt from the value-added tax.\n\n(T) [1]  Sale, importation or lease of passenger or cargo vessels and aircraft, including engine, equipment and spare parts thereof for domestic or international transport operations\";\n\nIn relation thereto, Section 4.109-1 (B) (1) (t) of the Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 16-2005, as amended by RR No. 15-2015, which implements the above-quoted provision, provides:\n\n\"SECTION 4.109-1.

Hence, the importation of the said cargo vessel by Chelsea Shipping Corporation is deemed compliant with the requirements on restriction on vessel importation and mandatory vessel retirement program of MARINA. Accordingly, the importation by Chelsea Shipping Corporation of Auxiliary Working Barge with 50 Tons Crane shall be exempt from VAT pursuant to Section 109 (1) (T) of the NIRC of 1997, as amended. The VAT exemption, however, shall be subject to the strict compliance of the conditions contained in the letter of approval issued by MARINA for the importation of the subject vessel.

The tax implications of the funds received by IEMOP for its own account and for remittance to other entities;\n\n2. The withholding tax implication of income payments made by IEMOP;\n\n3. The liability of IEMOP, as employer, to fringe benefits tax; and\n\n4. The value-added tax (VAT) implications of the receipt of funds by IEMOP, as operator of the Wholesale Electricity Spot Market (WESM).\n\nBackground of WESM\n\nWESM is defined as the electricity market established by the Department of Energy (DOE) under Republic Act (RA) No. 9136, otherwise known as the \"Electric Power Industry Reform Act of 2001,\" or EPIRA Law, which states:\n\n\"Sec. 30. Wholesale Electricity Spot Market. \u2014 Within one (1) year from the effectivity of this Act, the DOE shall establish a wholesale electricity spot market composed of the wholesale electricity spot market participants. The market shall provide the mechanism for identifying and setting the price of actual variations from the quantities transacted under contracts between sellers and purchasers of electricity.\n\nJointly with the electric power industry participants, the DOE shall formulate the detailed rules for the wholesale electricity spot market. Said rules shall provide the mechanism for determining the price of electricity not covered by bilateral contracts between sellers and purchasers of electricity users. The price determination methodology contained in said rules shall be subject to the approval of the ERC. Said rules shall also reflect accepted economic principles and provide a level playing field to all electric power industry participants. The rules shall provide, among others, procedures for: CAIHTE\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(c) Administering the market, including criteria for admission to and termination from the market which includes security of performance bond requirements, voting rights of the participants, surveillance and assurance of compliance of the participants with the rules and the formation of the wholesale electricity spot market governing body\"; (Underscoring supplied)\n\nThe objectives of WESM are to establish a competitive, efficient, transparent and reliable market for electricity where:\n\n1. A level playing field exists among WESM participants;\n\n2. Trading of electricity is facilitated among WESM participants within the spot market;\n\n3. Third parties are granted access to the power system in accordance with the Act (EPIRA Law);\n\n4. Prices are governed as far as practicable by commercial and market forces; and\n\n5. Efficiency is encouraged.\n\nThe idea is that all the output from generators would be centrally coordinated within the market and the buyers of bulk electricity would have to compete for a share in the electricity pool provided therein. Electricity is a peculiar commodity which cannot be stored and must be available on demand. Its flow is determined by the laws of physics and it is thus not possible to trace its flow. Because of the nature of the product and the pooling system within WESM, it is impossible for any particular sale of energy by one participant to be traced through a particular purchaser. This necessarily makes trading within the market an anonymous transaction as it is impossible to make a physical matching of the generator to its consumer.\n\nThe market participants \u2014 generating companies, customers, market operator, system operator, network service provider, ancillary services provider and metering service provider must register with the IEMOP in order to participate in the market.\n\nBackground of the Philippine Electricity Market Corporation (PEMC)\n\nTasked under the EPIRA Law to establish the WESM, the DOE together with the electric industry participants formulated the WESM Rules and constituted the Autonomous Group Market Operator (AGMO) which \"shall undertake the preparatory work and initial operation of the WESM for a period of 12 months from the spot market commencement date, initially under the administrative supervision of the National Transmission Corporation (TransCo).\" This AGMO constituted by the DOE is PEMC.\n\nPEMC was organized and established under the Corporation Code of the Philippines (Batas Pambansa [BP] No. 68) as a non-stock, non-profit corporation whose primary purpose is as follows:\n\n\"Manage, govern and administer an efficient, competitive, transparent and reliable market for the wholesale and purchase of electricity and ancillary services in the Philippines (the Wholesale Electricity Spot Market or \"WESM\") in accordance with Republic Act (RA) No. 9136 (EPIRA), the rules promulgated to govern the operation of the WESM (the \"WESM Rules\"), including their respective amendments and such other laws, rules and regulations which may be enacted hereafter that shall govern the WESM.\"\n\nFurthermore, as a non-stock non-profit corporation, it is explicitly stated in Article 10 of PEMC's Articles of Incorporation that \"no part of the income which the Corporation may obtain as in incident to its operation shall be distributed as dividends to its members, directors or officers subject to the provisions of the Corporation Code on dissolution. Any fund obtained by the Corporation as a result of its operation, whenever necessary or proper shall be used for the furtherance of the purposes enumerated in Article Second, subject to the provision of Title XI of the Corporation Code.\" DETACa\n\nIt must be emphasized that by administering WESM, PEMC does not thereby become a buyer or seller of electricity through the market. In other words, since PEMC merely operates, manages, and administers the market, PEMC will not buy nor sell electricity for its own account.\n\nThus, for a period of one (1) year from the spot market commencement date, the market operator which is responsible for the operation thereof is PEMC. This market operations function has been transferred to IEMOP on September 26, 2018.\n\nTransaction Flow\n\nUnder the current setup, a typical supply transaction within WESM is outlined as follows:\n\n1. A Generator submits an offer to supply electricity to the market and/or a Customer submits a demand bid to purchase electricity from the market;\n\n2. IEMOP sends an electronic confirmation of receipt and acceptance of the offer or bid;\n\n3. IEMOP matches supply with demand for that particular trading interval;\n\n4. IEMOP submits the dispatch schedule to the System Operator (SO);\n\n5. The SO implements the dispatch schedule, which means to say that the electricity purchased by the Customer through the market is delivered to identified points of supply by way of the network;\n\n6. IEMOP implements the settlement process by which the amounts due to IEMOP from every Market Participant and the amounts due from IEMOP to every Market Participant are paid out.\n\nThe various funds received or handled by IEMOP in the operation of the spot market may be categorized as either for its own account, or on behalf of the other entities, viz.:\n\nType of Fund\n\nFor the Account of\n\n1. Registration Fees\n\n- IEMOP\n\n2. Metering Fees\n\n- IEMOP\n\n3. Billing and Settlement Fees\n\n- IEMOP\n\n4. Administration Fees\n\n- IEMOP\n\n5. Costs\n\n- IEMOP\n\n6. Other Service Fees\n\n- IEMOP\n\n7. Special Assessments\n\n- IEMOP\n\n8. Funds from Contributions, Donations\n\n- IEMOP\n\n9. Energy Fee\n\n- Generator\n\n10. Ancillary Services Fee\n\n- Ancillary Service Provider\n\n11. Transmission Tariff\n\n- Network Service Provider\n\nFunds Received by IEMOP for its own account\n\nThe EPIRA Law provides:\n\n\"The cost of administering and operating the wholesale spot market shall be recovered by the market operator through a charge imposed to all market members: Provided, that such charge shall be filed with and approved by the ERC.\"\n\nThe law mandates the Market Operator (MO) to recover its costs for administering and operating the market. This is based on the logical presumption that the MO will not have any other source of funds except these charges on its members and thus, for its survival, and in order to continue administering and operating the market, the MO must be able to cover its costs.\n\nThus, in compliance with the EPIRA Law and WESM Rules, the IEMOP, as the MO, shall charge the members of the market (\"Market Fees\") which include:\n\n1. Registration fees, comprising of annual fee payable by each WESM Member for the category or categories in which they are registered: the registration fee is intended to defray the cost of the IEMOP in the registration process, which includes expenses for evaluation of the participant and its technical facilities to determine its qualifications to participate in WESM as well as expenses for training, digital certificates, the production of information materials and other related expenses;\n\n2. Metering Fees, to recover the IEMOP's budgeted revenue requirements for providing the billing and settlements services provided to the Members;\n\n3. Billing and Settlement Fees, to recover the IEMOP's budgeted revenue requirements for providing the billing and settlements service provided to the Members;\n\n4. Administration Fees, to recover the remainder of the IEMOP's budgeted revenue requirements not covered by the membership fees, membership dues, metering and Billing and Settlement Fees;\n\n5. Costs reasonably incurred by the Board and the Committees and working groups that the Board may create under the By-laws and the WESM rules; and\n\n6. Other Service Fees which the Board may impose such as Reserve Cost Recovery Charges and information dissemination charges.\n\nThe Market Fees are intended to defray the costs that will be incurred by the MO in administering and operating the market. Therefore, the Market Fees charged by IEMOP as administrator and operator of WESM are based on budgeted requirements.\n\nIn the fulfillment of its primary purpose of managing, administering and governing the market, IEMOP may in some instances realize Net Settlement Surplus which is the amount remaining after all the market transactions have been accounted for. Because the energy price charged from a Customer takes into account system losses and the additional costs arising from line congestion, the amount paid by a Customer would typically be higher than that which the IEMOP pays the Generator. Such Net Settlement Surplus may be utilized by IEMOP to: 1) fund deficits, 2) flowed back to Market Participants, 3) to establish and support the market for Financial Transmission Rights. In all instances, it shall be clearly accounted for and taken into account when setting the allowable charges under any regulatory instruments applying to IEMOP. ATICcS\n\nFunds Received by IEMOP for other Entities\n\nSince the electricity supplied within the market is \"pooled\" together and centrally coordinated, it is not possible to trace which Generator produced the electricity consumed by a particular Customer. The amounts due from each Customer to the Generators could only be coursed through the market.\n\nIEMOP performs the function of settling the amounts payable by or to any Market Participant and in the course thereof, receives various funds actually meant for other participants in the market.\n\nIn view of the foregoing, you now request for continuation of the following opinions:\n\n1. The Market Fees/Net Settlement Surplus/Membership Dues and Fees received by IEMOP for its own account, are not subject to corporate income tax and consequently, exempt from withholding tax;\n\n2. The income of IEMOP from its properties and for activities conducted for profit is subject to income tax and consequently, to withholding tax;\n\n3. The payments received by IEMOP as operator of the market, but which are earmarked for other entities, are not part of IEMOP's gross income, and consequently, are not subject to income tax in the hands of IEMOP;\n\n4. IEMOP, as income payer, is constituted as withholding agent which shall be liable to withhold the appropriate withholding tax on its income payments as prescribed in Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 2-98, as amended;\n\n5. IEMOP shall be designated as a withholding tax agent for WESM transactions and shall be responsible for withholding and remitting withholding taxes and issuing the requisite withholding tax certificates;\n\n6. IEMOP, as employer is subject to final tax imposed on the grossed-up monetary value of fringe benefit furnished to its employees, except rank and file employees;\n\n7. All funds received by IEMOP for its own account as a result of its administration and operation of WESM, and which funds are held in trust for and on behalf of the WESM members, are not subject to VAT;\n\n8. All funds received by IEMOP as MO, but which are intended, and actually earmarked, for other entities, are not included in IEMOP's gross receipt, hence not subject to VAT in the hands of IEMOP;\n\n9. Transactions for the supply of energy and ancillary services made through the WESM shall be exempt from the requirements of Section 237 of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997 (Tax Code), as amended, subject to adequate procedures and documentation;\n\n10. IEMOP may be passed on with VAT by its suppliers of goods and services, and may be liable for VAT on its importations, which shall form part of its cost of goods and services purchased;\n\n11. The use of a generation mix ratio (GMR), calculated as the ratio of the Total VATable (12%) Spot Market Sales over the Total Spot Market Sales, will properly account for the zero-rated sales of generation companies generating power from renewable energy (RE) resources;\n\n12. The transfer of market infrastructure, other personal and real properties, cash and PSALM loan and loan repayment funds from PEMC to IEMOP is not subject to income tax, VAT, documentary stamp tax (DST), and donor's tax. TIADCc\n\nIn reply, please be informed as follows:\n\nINCOME TAX\n\n1. Market Fees/Net Settlement Surplus/\nMembership Dues and Fees\n\nThere is no doubt that WESM is the market where trading of electricity will be made and PEMC, now IEMOP, was setup by the DOE, along with other electric industry participants, as the AGMO which, pursuant to the EPIRA Law, is to undertake preparatory work and initial operation of the WESM for twelve (12) months from the spot market commencement date. As such, IEMOP was organized for the purpose of managing, governing and administering an efficient, competitive, transparent and reliable market for the wholesale purchase of electricity in the Philippines.\n\nIEMOP, which is organized as a non-stock, non profit corporation, claims that it should be treated as a business league under Section 30 (F) of the Tax Code, as amended. The pertinent provision states:\n\n\"Sec. 30. Exemption from Tax on Corporation. \u2014 The following organizations shall not be taxed under this Title in respect to income received by them as such.\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(F) Business league, chamber of commerce, or board of trade, not organized for profit and no part of the net income of which inures to the benefit of any private stockholder or individual\";\n\nSection 31 of RR No. 02-40, however, defines a \"business league\" as follows:\n\n\"SECTION 31. Business leagues. \u2014 A business league is an association of persons having some common business interest, which limits its activities to work for such common interest and does not engage in a regular business of a kind ordinarily carried on for profit. Its work need not be similar to that of a chamber of commerce or board of trade. If it engages in a regular business of a kind ordinarily carried on for profit, the fact that the business is conducted on a cooperative basis or produces only sufficient income to be self-sustaining, is not ground for exemption. An association engaged in furnishing information to prospective investors, to enable them to make sound investments, is not exempt, since its members have no common business interest, even though all of its income is devoted to the purpose stated. x x x.\" (Underscoring supplied)\n\nFrom the definition of a \"business league,\" IEMOP, as the market operator of WESM, cannot qualify as such considering the nature and purposes of its incorporation. The various market participants, although registered as members of WESM, cannot be said to be of common business interest with IEMOP since the reason for their membership is to enable them to participate in the trading and not to further IEMOP's purposes. Moreover, its activity as a market operator of WESM, for which it receives market/service fees from its trading participants for the availment of its services, is a regular business of a kind ordinarily carried on for profit. It is similar to other online platforms whose income for the provision of online services are ordinarily subject to applicable taxes under the Tax Code.\n\nIn BIR Ruling No. 113-82 dated April 15, 1982, upon the request for exemption from income tax by then Manila Stock Exchange, which was organized as a non-stock non-profit corporation, the BIR opined that:\n\n\"It has been held that if the organization's primary purpose is to provide services or facilities for transaction business to individuals or a limited class, it is not an exempt business league. Thus a stock or commodity exchange is not a business league. [34 Am. Jur.2d p. 687 (1976 ed)]\n\nIn review thereof, the Manila Stock Exchange, cannot be considered an exempt business league within the purview of Section 27(f) of the Tax Code. Consequently, it should file an income tax return and pay income tax on its net income.\"\n\nBased on the foregoing, IEMOP cannot be considered an exempt business league as construed by Section 30 of the Tax Code, as amended. Accordingly. IEMOP is subject to corporate income tax under Section 27 of the Tax Code, as amended, and consequently to withholding tax pursuant to Section 57 of the same Tax Code.\n\nOn the issue of whether or not Market Fees/Net Settlement Surplus/Membership fees received by IEMOP are subject to income tax, it is a principle of taxation that income, in the broad sense, means all wealth which flows into the taxpayer other than mere return of capital. [2] AIDSTE\n\nUnder WESM Rules, Market Fees [3] are imposed by IEMOP such that \u2014\n\n\"The cost of administering and operating the WESM shall be recovered by the Market Operator through a charge imposed on all WESM Members or WESM transactions, provided that such charge shall be filed by the market operator with the ERC for approval.\" [4]\n\n\"In developing the structure and level of market fees, the market operator shall take into consideration the manner in which it intends to charge each category of WESM members, and whether that charging proposal is reasonable given the relative involvement of each category of WESM member in the spot market.\" [5]\n\nMarket fees is a collective term that includes registration fees, metering fees, billing and settlement fees, administration fees and other costs, as represented. In short, this is the amount paid for by the WESM members for its administration and operation.\n\nOn the other hand, \"Net Settlement Surplus\" is defined in WESM Rules as \"the settlement surplus remaining after all market transaction have been accounted for, including the assignment of transmission line rentals to the Network Service Providers. This remainder is assumed to be attributable to economic rentals arising from other binding constraints.\"\n\n\"3.14.16 of the WESM Rules provides for the treatment of Remaining Settlement Surplus as follows:\n\n3.13.16.1 If the transactions required by clauses 3.13.144 and 3.13.155, in aggregate, result in a surplus or deficit remaining, this will be known as the net settlement surplus.\n\n3.13.16.2 The net settlement surplus:\n\n(a) May be retained by the Market Operator, or paid to the System Operator, according to a formula to be developed by the Market Operator subject to approval of the PEM Board; and\n\n(b) Shall be clearly accounted for and taken into account when setting the allowable charges under any regulatory instruments applying to the Market Operator and the System Operator.\"\n\nConsidering that these monies flow into IEMOP as part of its operations, benefiting the corporation and having the discretion on how to apply the net settlement surplus, they shall be part of the corporation's gross income subject to income tax.\n\n2. Income of IEMOP from its properties and\nfor activities conducted for profit is subject\nto income tax\n\nAs previously discussed, IEMOP does not qualify as a tax-exempt organization under Section 30 of the Tax Code, as amended. Hence, its income derived from any of its properties, real or personal or from any of its activities conducted for profit regardless of the disposition made of such income shall be subject to tax imposed under the Tax Code, as amended. Moreover, its interest income derived from Philippine currency bank deposits and yield or any other monetary benefits from deposit substitute instruments are subject to the 20% final withholding tax pursuant to Section 27 (D) (1), in relation to Section 57 (A), both of the Tax Code, as amended.\n\n3. The payments received by IEMOP which\nare earmarked for other entities are not\npart of IEMOP's gross income\n\nAs represented, IEMOP receives various funds either for its own account or on behalf of other entities such as energy fee, ancillary services fee and transmission tariff.\n\nIn BIR Ruling No. 020-02 dated May 13, 2002 issued to the Power Sector Assets & Liabilities Management Corporation (PSALM) confirming the latter's opinion that collection of universal charge will not be considered as taxable income, this Office ruled that:\n\n\"On the other hand, the Universal Charge received by PSALM will not be in the nature of income as defined in Sec. 32(A) of the Tax Code of 1997, which includes gains, profits, and income derived from salaries, wages, or compensation for personal services of whatever kind and in whatever form paid, or from professions, vocations, trades, business, commerce, sales, or dealings in property, whether real or personal, growing out of the ownership or use of or interest in such property; also from interest, rents, dividends, securities, or transactions or any business carried on for gain or profits, and income derived from any source whatever. Income, in a broad sense, means all wealth that flows into the taxpayer other than as a mere return of capital. (Section 36, Revenue Regulations No. 2, otherwise known as the Income Tax Regulations). The Universal Charge is not a flow of wealth to PSALM as it would not accrue to its benefit but would be remitted to the Special Trust Fund, as provided under the EPIRA.\" AaCTcI\n\nIEMOP's receipt of the energy fee for the Generator, ancillary services fee for the Ancillary Service Provider and transmission tariff for the Network Service Provider, will not redound to the benefit of IEMOP, but are earmarked and actually remitted to the said participants in the market and therefore, not in the nature of income, nor a flow of wealth to IEMOP.\n\nTherefore, the payments received by IEMOP as operator of the market, but which are earmarked for other entities, are not part of IEMOP's gross income, and consequently, are not subject to income tax in the hands of IEMOP.\n\n4. IEMOP, as income payer, is constituted\nas withholding agent\n\nIEMOP is required to impose withholding taxes on certain income payments made by it pursuant to Section 2.57 of RR No. 2-98, as amended.\n\nIEMOP, as employer is constituted as withholding agent of the government when its employees receive compensation income subject to the withholding tax under Section 79 (A), Chapter XIII, Title II of the Tax Code, as amended, as implemented by RR No. 2-98, as amended, or if it makes income payments to individuals or corporations subject to the expanded withholding tax provided for in Section 57 (B) of the Tax Code, as amended, also as implemented by RR No. 2-98, as amended.\n\n5. The Customer/Buyer shall be the withholding tax\nagent for energy sold and paid through the WESM,\nwhile both the Customer/Buyer and Generator/Seller\nshall be the withholding tax agents for the Market Fees\ncollected by IEMOP.\n\nConsidering that electricity is of the nature of \"fungible\" goods, defined as \"(g)oods which are identical with others of the same nature, such as grain and oil; a product which has no important characteristics that identify it as coming from a particular supplier,\" [6] and considering further the gross pool nature of the WESM as a market, it will be impossible for a WESM electricity customer to identify the electricity it purchased as coming from a particular WESM electricity seller.\n\nSince the MO has a view of all the electricity generated for sale and by which company, as well as all the customers and their particular purchases, the role of the MO is therefore key in matching the transactions, as only the MO knows who the actual customers and sellers are.\n\nThus, after the sale of energy, the MO prepares a \"transaction summary of energy sold\" and provides copies of the \"settlement statements of energy sold (broken down by customer)\" to the Generators/Sellers and the \"settlement statements of energy purchased (broken down by seller)\" to the Customers/Buyers.\n\nThe Customer/Buyer can then proceed to remit payment, net of withholding taxes, for the purchase of energy, through the MO's payment facility using the \"settlement statements\" as bases. The MO payment facility then proceeds to transmit payment to the Generator/Seller upon the MO's payment instructions. The Generator/Seller then issues the Official Receipts under the names of the Customers/Buyers based on the settlement statements and payments/remittances made by the MO payment facility. The Customer/Buyer in turn issues the BIR Form No. 2307 [7] to the Generators/Sellers. The Customers/Buyers shall then remit to the BIR the taxes withheld from the payments for electricity purchased through the WESM. This arrangement shall ensure that the withholding taxes are properly withheld and remitted, and the Generators/Sellers in the WESM are properly credited with the taxes withheld. EcTCAD\n\nOn the other hand, both the Generator/Seller and the Customer/Buyer are designated as withholding tax agents for the market fees charged by and paid to IEMOP. IEMOP bills the Generator/Seller and the Customer/Buyer for the corresponding market fees. The Customer/Buyer pays IEMOP the market fees net of withholding tax and shall remit the withholding tax to the BIR. Prior to remitting the amount on the sale of electricity to the Generator/Seller, IEMOP shall deduct and keep its market fees net of withholding tax and remit the amount, together with the withholding tax on the market fees, to the Generator/Seller. The Generator/Seller then shall remit the withholding tax on the market fees to the BIR. Both the Generator/Seller and the Customer Buyer shall issue BIR Form No. 2307 to the MO for the taxes they withheld on the payment of Market Fees.\n\nIn cases where an aggregator buys electricity from a seller in WESM through a generation company, two separate transactions shall be considered, to wit: (1) the sale from the seller to the generation company; and (2) the sale from the generation company to the aggregator. In such cases, the generation company shall be the designated withholding tax agent for the sale transaction between the seller and the generation company, while the aggregator shall be the designated withholding tax agent for the transaction between the generation company and the aggregator.\n\n6. IEMOP, as employer, is subject to final\ntax imposed on fringe benefits furnished\nto its employees\n\nSection 33 (A) of the Tax Code, as amended by RA No. 10963, provides for the special treatment of fringe benefits, to wit:\n\n\"SEC. 33. Special Treatment of Fringe Benefit. \u2014\n\n(A) Imposition of Tax. \u2014 Effective January 1, 2018 and onwards, a final tax of thirty-five percent (35%) is hereby imposed on the grossed-up monetary value of fringe benefit furnished or granted to the employee (except rank and file employees defined herein) by the employer, whether an individual or a corporation (unless the fringe benefit is required by the nature of, or necessary to the trade, business or profession of the employer, or when the fringe benefit is for the convenience or advantage of the employer). The tax herein imposed is payable by the employer which tax shall be paid in the same manner as provided for under Section 57 (A) of this Code. The grossed-up monetary value of the fringe benefit shall be determined by dividing the actual monetary value of the fringe benefit by sixty-five percent (65%) effective January 1, 1998; sixty-seven percent (67%) effective January 1, 1999; and sixty-eight percent (68%) effective January 1, 2000 and thereafter: Provided, however, That fringe benefit furnished to employees and taxable under Subsections (B), (C), (D) and (E) of Section 25 shall be taxed at the applicable rates imposed thereat: Provided, further, That the grossed-up monetary value of the fringe benefit shall be determined by dividing the actual monetary value of the fringe benefit by the difference between one hundred percent (100%) and the applicable rates of income tax under Subsections (B), (C), (D), and (E) of Section 25.\"\n\nHence, if IEMOP furnishes or grants any goods, service, or benefit in cash or in kind to its employees, except rank and file, it is subject to a final tax of 35% [8] of the grossed-up monetary value of the fringe benefit. However, if benefit furnished or granted is required by the nature or, or necessary to the conduct of business of IEMOP's activities, or when the fringe benefit is for the convenience or advantage of IEMOP as employer, it is not subject to said tax.\n\nMembership fees, dues and other expenses borne by the employer for the employee in social and athletic clubs or other similar organizations are fringe benefits under Section 33 (B) (6) of the Tax Code, as amended. [9] HSAcaE\n\nHowever, transportation and representation allowances that are fixed in amounts and are regularly received by the employees as part of their monthly compensation income shall not be treated as taxable fringe benefits but the same shall be treated as allowances which shall form part of their taxable compensation income subject to income tax and consequently to the withholding tax prescribed under Section 79 of the Tax Code, as amended. [10]\n\nVALUE-ADDED TAX\n\nSection 105 of the Tax Code, as amended, provides for the persons liable for VAT, to wit:\n\n\"SEC. 105. Persons Liable. \u2014 Any person who, in the course of his trade or business, sells, barters, exchanges or leases goods or properties, or renders services, and any person who imports goods, shall be liable to value-added tax (VAT) imposed in Sections 106 to 108 of this Code.\"\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\nThe phrase \"in the course of trade or business\" means the regular conduct or pursuit of a commercial or an economic activity, including transactions incidental thereto, by any person regardless of whether or not the person engaged therein is a non-stock, nonprofit private organization (irrespective of the disposition of its net income and whether or not it sells exclusively to members or their guests), or government entity.\"\n\nIn the case of Commissioner of Internal Revenue vs. Court of Appeals and Commonwealth Management and Services Corporation, [11] the Supreme Court held that even a non-stock, non-profit organization or government entity is liable to pay VAT on the sale of goods or services, thus:\n\n\"Contrary to COMASERCO's contention the above provision clarifies that even a non-stock, non-profit organization or government entity, is liable to pay VAT on the sale of goods or services. VAT is a tax on transactions, imposed at every stage of the distribution process on the sale, barter, exchange of goods or property, and on the performance of services, even in the absence of profit attributable thereto. The term \"in the course of trade or business\" requires the regular conduct or pursuit of commercial or an economic activity, regardless or whether or not the entity is profit-oriented.\n\nThe definition of the term \"in the course of trade or business\" incorporated in the present law applies to all transactions even to those made prior to its enactment. Executive Order No. 273 stated that any person who, in the course of trade or business, sells, barters or exchanges goods and services, was already liable to par VAT. The present law merely stresses that even a nonstock, nonprofit organization or government entity is liable to pay VAT for the sale of goods and services.\n\nSec. 108 of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997 defines the phrase \"sale of services\" as the \"performance of all kinds of services for others for a fee, remuneration or consideration.\" It includes \"the supply of technical advice, assistance or services rendered in connection with technical management or administration of any scientific, industrial or commercial undertaking or project.\"\n\nOn February 5, 1998, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue issued BIR Ruling No. 010-98 emphasizing that a domestic corporation that provided technical, research, management and technical assistance to its affiliated companies and received payments on a reimbursement-of-cost basis, without any intention of realizing profit, was subject to VAT on services rendered. In fact, even if such corporation was organized without any intention of realizing profit, any income or profit generated by the entity in the conduct of its activities was subject to income tax.\n\nHence, it is immaterial whether the primary purpose of a corporation indicates that it receives payments for services rendered to its affiliates on a reimbursement-of-cost basis only, without realizing profit, for purposes of determining liability for VAT on services rendered. As long as the entity provides service for a fee, remuneration or consideration, then the service rendered is subject to VAT.\n\nAt any rate, it is a rule that because taxes are the lifeblood of the nation, statutes that allow exemptions are construed strictly against the grantee and liberally in favor of the government. Otherwise stated, any exemption from the payment of a tax must be clearly stated in the language of the law; it cannot be merely implied therefrom. In the case of VAT, Section 109, Republic Act 8424 clearly enumerates the transactions exempted from VAT. The services rendered by COMASERCO do not fall within the exemptions. HESIcT\n\nBoth the Commissioner of Internal Revenue and the Court of Tax Appeals correctly ruled that the services rendered by COMASERCO to Philamlife and its affiliates are subject to VAT. As pointed out by the Commissioner, the performance of all kinds of services for others for a fee, remuneration or consideration is considered as a sale of services subject to VAT. As the government agency charged with the enforcement of the law, the opinion of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, in the absence of any showing that it is plainly wrong, is entitled to great weight. Also, it has been the long standing policy and practice of this Court to respect the conclusions of quasi-judicial agencies, such as the Court of Tax Appeals which, by the nature of its functions, is dedicated exclusively to the study and consideration of tax cases and has necessarily developed an expertise on the subject, unless there has been an abuse or improvident exercise of its authority.\n\nThere is no merit to respondent's contention that the Court of Tax Appeals' decision in CA-G.R. No. 34042, declaring the COMASERCO as not engaged in business and not liable for the payment of fixed and percentage taxes, binds petitioner. The issue in CA-G.R. No. 34042 is different from the present case, which involves COMASERCO's liability for VAT. As heretofore stated, every person who sells, barters, or exchanges goods and services, in the course of trade or business, as defined by law, is subject to VAT.\" (Underscoring supplied)\n\nWith the foregoing in mind, we rule as follows:\n\n1. All the funds received by IEMOP for its own\naccount as a result of its administration and\noperation of WESM are subject to VAT\n\nSection 30 of EPIRA Law provides that the cost of administering and operating the wholesale spot market shall be recovered by the market operator (IEMOP) through a charge imposed to all market members.\n\nPursuant thereto, IEMOP charges several fees collectively referred to as \"Market Fees\" the components of which are the following: registration fees, metering fee, billing and settlement fees, administration fees, costs reasonably incurred by its Board and the committees and working groups that the Board appoints under WESM Rules as well as other service fees.\n\nIn the same vein as in the above-cited jurisprudence, it has been settled that for as long as the entity provides service for a fee, remuneration or consideration, the service rendered is subject to VAT. In upholding the assessment of the BIR, the Supreme Court held that it is immaterial whether the primary purpose of a corporation indicates that it receives payments for services rendered to its affiliates on a reimbursement-in-cost basis only, without realizing profit, for purposes of determining liability for VAT on services rendered. For as long as the entity provides service for a fee, remuneration or consideration, then the service rendered is subject to VAT.\n\nHence, considering that IEMOP performs services as market operator of WESM and for which the market participants and members are charged market fees collected by IEMOP, said fees/payments, shall be subject to VAT, notwithstanding its status as a non-stock, non-profit organization.\n\nRegistration or membership fees of the market participants, however, are exempt from VAT since these comprise fees intended to defray cost of registration and expenses incidental thereto. [12]\n\n2. Funds received by IEMOP intended and\nactually earmarked for other entities are\nnot included as part of IEMOP's gross receipts\n\nSection 108 (A) of the Tax Code, as amended, states that:\n\n\"SEC. 108. Value-Added Tax on Sale of Services and Use or Lease of Properties. \u2014\n\n(A) Rate and Base of Tax. There shall be levied, assessed and collected a value-added tax equivalent to twelve percent (12%) of gross receipts derived from the sale or exchange of services, including the rise or lease of properties. caITAC\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\nThe term \"gross receipts\" means the total amount of money or its equivalent representing the contract price, compensation, service fee, rental or royalty, including the amount charged for materials supplied with the services and deposits and advanced payments actually or constructively received during the taxable quarter for the services performed or to be performed for another person, excluding value-added tax.\"\n\nIn relation thereto, Section 11 of RR No. 04-2007 [13] dated February 7, 2007 provides viz.:\n\n\"SECTION 11. Gross Receipts. \u2014 Sec. 4.108-4 of RR No. 16-2005 is hereby amended to read as follows:\n\nSEC. 4.108-4. Definition of Gross Receipts. \u2014 'Gross receipts' refers to the total amount of money or its equivalent representing the contract price, compensation, service fee, rental or royalty, including the amount charged for materials supplied with the services and deposits applied as payments actually or constructively received during the taxable period for the services performed or to be performed for another person, excluding the VAT, except those amounts earmarked for payment to unrelated third (3rd) party or received as reimbursement for advance payment on behalf of another which do not redound to the benefit of the payor.\n\nA payment is a payment to a third (3rd) party if the same is made to settle an obligation of another person, e.g., customer or client, to the said third party, which obligation is evidenced by the sales invoice/official receipt issued by said third party to the obligor/debtor (e.g., customer or client of the payor of the obligation).\" (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)\n\nIn the case of Commissioner of Internal Revenue vs. Tours Specialists, Inc., [14] the Supreme Court declared that:\n\n\"Gross receipts subject to tax under the Tax Code, as amended, do not include monies or receipts entrusted to the taxpayer which do not belong to them and do not redound to the taxpayer's benefit; and it is not necessary that there must be a law or regulation which would exempt such monies and receipts within the meaning of gross receipts under the Tax Code, as amended.\" (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)\n\nUnder the above-quoted provision, in relation to the said decision of the Supreme Court, it is clear that gross receipts do not include monies or receipts entrusted to the taxpayer and those amounts earmarked for payment to unrelated third (3rd) party or received as reimbursement for advance payment on behalf of another which do not redound to the benefit of the payor. Therefore, the energy fee for the Generator, ancillary services fee for the Ancillary Service Provider, and transmission tariff for the Network Service Provider, which will not redound to the benefit of IEMOP, but are only earmarked and actually remitted to the said participants in the market, should not be included as part of IEMOP's gross receipts.\n\n3. Transactions for the supply of energy\nand ancillary services made through the\nWESM shall be subject to the requirements\nof Section 237 of the Tax Code\n\nSection 237 of the Tax Code, as amended, provides:\n\n\"Section 237. Issuance of Receipts or Sales or Commercial Invoices. \u2014\n\n(A) Issuance. \u2014 All persons subject to an internal revenue tax shall, at the point of each sale and transfer of merchandise or for services rendered valued at One hundred pesos (P100) [15] or more, issue duly registered receipts or sale or commercial invoices, showing the date of transaction, quantity, unit cost and description of merchandise or nature of service: Provided, however, That where the receipt is issued to cover payment made as rentals, commissions, compensations or fees, receipts or invoices shall be issued which shall show the name, business style, if any, and address of the purchaser, customer or client: Provided, further, That where the purchaser is a VAT-registered person, in addition to the information herein required, the invoice or receipt shall further show the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) of the purchaser. ICHDca\n\nWithin five (5) years from the effectivity of this Act and upon the establishment of a system capable of storing and processing the required data, the Bureau shall require taxpayers engaged in the export of goods and services, taxpayers engaged in e-commerce, and taxpayers under the jurisdiction of the Large Taxpayers Service to issue electronic receipts or sales or commercial invoices in lieu of manual receipts or sales or commercial invoices, subject to the rules and regulations to be issued by the Secretary of Finance upon recommendation of the Commissioner and after a public hearing shall have been held for this purpose: Provided, That taxpayers not covered by the mandate of this provision may issue electronic receipts or sales or commercial invoices, in lieu of manual receipts, and sales and commercial invoices.\n\nThe original of each receipt or invoice shall be issued to the purchaser, customer or client at the time the transaction is effected, who, if engaged in business or in the exercise of profession, shall keep and preserve the same in his place of business for a period of three (3) years from the close of the taxable year in which such invoice or receipt was issued, while the duplicate shall be kept and preserved by the issuer, also in his place of business, for a like period: Provided, That in case of electronic receipts or sales or commercial invoices, the digital records of the same shall be kept by the purchaser, customer or client and the issuer for the same period above stated.\n\nThe Commissioner may, in meritorious cases, exempt any person subject to internal revenue tax from compliance with the provisions of this Section.\"\n\nAs defined in RR No. 12-98, the term \"receipt(s)\" means a written admission or acknowledgment of the fact of payment in money or other settlement between seller and buyer of goods, debtor or creditor, or persons rendering services and client or customers. Apparently, it is not merely an evidence of sale but necessarily an evidence of payment. This is obvious from the provisions of Section 237 to the effect that the issuance of an invoice is required the moment there is already a sale or transaction of merchandise or services rendered.\n\nAs already established, WESM is the market where the participants buy and sell their commodity which is electricity. Essentially, it is the market that receives the demand and matches the supply of electricity in accordance thereto since there is neither a specific customer from the point of view of the generators nor a specific generator from the point of view of the customers. Thus, in the sale of electricity by the Generators traded through WESM, the Generators cannot issue official receipts in the name of the particular buyer of electricity but can only bill/charge IEMOP for the value of the electricity supplied by it upon trading in the market.\n\nInasmuch as receipts are not only pieces of evidence of sale but also proof of payment by the customers and end-users, the Generator/Seller and the MO cannot be exempted from issuing official receipts under Section 237 of the Tax Code, as amended, for the supply of electricity and ancillary services provided to the customers, as well as for the market fees it collects from trading participants.\n\nRevenue Memorandum Circular (RMC) No. 61-2005 [16] was issued to clarify certain BIR issuances affecting generation, transmission, and distribution companies as well as electric cooperatives as defined in RA No. 9136 (EPIRA Law) subject to the VAT as well as their suppliers and customers. In the main, the RMC states that generation, transmission, and distribution companies as well as electric cooperatives shall be subject to VAT on their sale of electricity pursuant to the provisions of Section 108, in relation to Section 109, of the Tax Code, as amended.\n\nIt is argued that for uniformity of treatment, IEMOP should be treated in the same manner as that of the Distribution Utilities (DUs) which is a pass-through entity with respect to sale of electricity.\n\nWe disagree. IEMOP, as market operator, is not in the same category as the DUs or even similarly situated taking into account its role in the flow of transactions purchasing electricity which are not necessarily end-users. TCAScE\n\nAs previously mentioned, the MO prepares the transaction summary of energy sold and provides copies of the settlement statements of energy sold (broken down by customer) to the Generators/Sellers and the settlement statements of energy purchased (broken down by seller) to the Customers/Buyers. The Customers/Buyers can then proceed to remit payments through the MO payment facility using the \"settlement statements\" as bases. The MO payment facility then proceeds to transmit payments to Generators/Sellers. The Generators/Sellers, then issue the Official Receipts under the names of the Customers/Buyers based on the settlement statements from the MO and the payments/remittances made by the MO payment facility.\n\nThe MO, on the other hand, issues the official receipts to the Generators/Sellers and the Customers/Buyers for the income payments the MO receives on its own account (e.g., Market Fees).\n\nThe sale of electricity covered by bilateral agreements and settled outside WESM shall be governed by existing rules and regulations regarding invoicing requirements.\n\nFor situations where an Aggregator buys electricity from a seller in WESM through a generation company, two separate transactions shall be considered. Thus, two separate Official Receipts shall be issued \u2014 one from the WESM Seller to the Generation Company as Customer/Buyer, and another from the Generation Company to the Aggregator.\n\n4. IEMOP is not exempt from pass-on VAT\non its purchase of goods and services\n\nThe VAT is a tax on the person who sells, barters, exchanges, leases goods or properties, renders services, and on any person who imports goods pursuant to Section 105 of the Tax Code, as amended. It should be noted that VAT is an indirect tax payable by the seller and not by the purchaser of goods.\n\nHowever, being an indirect tax, it can be shifted or passed on to the buyer/purchaser, transferee or lessee of the goods, properties or services. Once shifted to the buyer/customer as an addition to the cost of goods or services sold, it is no longer a tax but an additional cost which the buyer/customer has to pay in order to obtain the goods or services. [17]\n\nSince there is no showing that IEMOP is exempt from indirect tax under any existing law, its purchases of goods, properties or services from VAT registered entities are subject to the 12% VAT, which can be passed on to it by the seller as an indirect tax and shall form part of the invoice price thereof. [18]\n\n5. The use of the GMR to account for\nthe zero-rated sales is proper\n\nThe GMR calculated as follows is proper and acceptable to account for the VAT zero-rated sales of generation companies generating power from renewable energy (RE) resources, to wit:\n\nGMR\n\n=\n\nTotal 12% VATable Spot Market Sales\n\nTotal Spot Market Sales\n\n6. The transfer of assets and liabilities\nfrom PEMC to IEMOP is not subject to\nincome tax, VAT, DST, and donor's tax\n\nRegarding the transfer of market infrastructure, other personal and real properties, cash and PSALM loan and loan repayment funds from PEMC to IEMOP, BIR Ruling No. 020-02 dated May 13, 2002 issued to PSALM states:\n\n\"In this case, the transfer of NPC's generation assets and liabilities to PSALM, as well as of the transmission and subtransmission assets and systems to TRANSCO, all of which are government-owned and -controlled corporations is mandated by law. There is no positive offer to sell and buy the aforesaid NPC properties. Moreover, consideration, which should be the prime reason for the transfer of abovementioned assets, is not availing to the parties in the transfer of the aforementioned NPC assets. Although it has been stated earlier, it should bear stressing that this is a transaction between and among government-owned and -controlled corporations pursuant to a law calling for the reorganization of NPC's assets. cTDaEH\n\nConsideration is defined as the inducement to a contract. It is the reason or material cause of a contract. It is some right, interest, profit, or benefit accruing to one party. (Black's Law Dictionary, 6th Edition)\n\nIn the case of PSALM, its assumption of NPC's liabilities is mandated by law. Normally, the transfer of property by a person (transferor) to another person (transferee) in exchange for the assumption by said person of the transferor's liability will be considered a sale, where the assumption of liability constitutes a consideration for the assets. The gain, if any, from the transfer is the difference between the higher of the consideration received or zonal value, if applicable, and the value of the assets given up. The amount of the liabilities transferred is treated as part of the consideration.\n\nLikewise, the taking of title over the assets of NPC by PSALM for the purpose of selling or disposing them, is consistent with the guidelines set under the EPIRA. Unlike in an ordinary business transaction, PSALM, as the entity assuming the obligation, does not exercise any discretion whether to accept the assets and liabilities to be transferred nor does it play any role in the determination of the amount of the liabilities that it will assume.\" (Underscoring supplied)\n\nIn this case, the transfer of assets and liabilities from PEMC to IEMOP was pursuant to the EPIRA Law, specifically RA No. 9136, thus, there is no consideration in the transfer of assets and liabilities. Therefore, such transfer is not subject to income tax or to the creditable withholding tax/capital gains tax. In the same manner, since the transfer is not a transaction contemplated under Sections 196 and 198 of the Tax Code, as amended, the transfer is not subject to documentary stamp tax (DST) under the said Sections. The notarial certification is, however, subject to DST under Section 188 of the Tax Code, as amended.\n\nMoreover, the transfer of assets and liabilities from PEMC to IEMOP is not subject to VAT. In the case of PSALM vs. Commissioner of Internal Revenue [19] the Supreme Court held:\n\n\"x x x Under the EPIRA law, the ownership of these power plants was transferred to PSALM for sale, disposition, and privatization in order to liquidate all NPC financial obligations. Unlike the Mindanao II case, the power plants in this case were not previously used in PSALM's business. The power plants, which were previously owned by NPC were transferred to PSALM for the specific purpose of privatizing such assets. The sale of the power plants cannot be considered as an incidental transaction made in the course of NPC's or PSALM's business. Therefore, the sale of the power plants should not be subject to VAT.\"\n\nIn the instant case, there was an express mandate by the EPIRA Law to transfer the assets and liabilities from PEMC to IEMOP, as follows:\n\n\"SEC. 30. Wholesale Electricity Spot Market. \u2014 Within one (1) year from the effectivity of this Act, the DOE shall establish a wholesale electricity spot market composed of the wholesale electricity spot market participants. The market shall provide the mechanism for identifying and setting the price of actual variations from the quantities transacted under contracts between sellers and purchasers of electricity.\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\nThe wholesale electricity spot market shall be implemented by a market operator in accordance with the wholesale electricity spot market rules. The market operator shall be an autonomous group, to be constituted by DOE, with equitable representation from electric power industry participants, initially under the administrative supervision of the TRANSCO. The market operator shall undertake the preparatory work and initial operation of the wholesale electricity spot market. Not later than one (1) year after the implementation of the wholesale electricity spot market, an independent entity shall be formed and the functions, assets and liabilities of the market operator shall be transferred to such entity with the joint endorsement of the DOE and the electric power industry participants. Thereafter, the administrative supervision of the TRANSCO over such entity shall cease. (Underscoring supplied) cSaATC\n\nThere was no sale, barter, exchange, or lease of goods or properties in the course of trade or business that would make the transfer come under the purview of Section 105 of the Tax Code, as amended. Thus, such transfer of assets and liabilities is not subject to VAT.\n\nLikewise, since the transfer was mandated by the EPIRA Law, there was no donative intent on the part of the transferor (PEMC). Neither did the transferee (IEMOP) exercise any discretion on whether to accept the assets and liabilities to be transferred, nor did IEMOP play any role in the determination of the amount of the liabilities that it will assume. Thus, such transfer of assets and liabilities is not subject to donor's tax.\n\n7. The electricity purchased by Renewable Energy (RE) Developers\nthrough WESM, if any, that is subsequently sold in WESM\nshall be generally subject to VAT\n\nWhile the sale of power or fuel generated through renewable sources of energy is subject to zero percent (0%) VAT under Section 108 (B) (7) of the Tax Code, power supply that is purchased through WESM by RE Developers and subsequently sold therein shall not be entitled to the zero percent (0%) VAT unless it can be ascertained that the same is generated from a renewable source of energy as required under the Tax Code.\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be disclosed that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R. DULAY\nCommissioner of Internal Revenue\n\n1. Previously, the Philippine Electricity Market Corporation or PEMC handled the market operations of the Wholesale Electricity Spot Market or WESM. This market operations function has been transferred to IEMOP on September 26, 2018.

No. 7227, as amended, otherwise known as the Base Conversion and Development Act of 1992), as amended.\n\nAs represented, SATAC is incorporated and domiciled in the Philippines. It is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) with office address and principal place of business at N2835 Jose Abad Santos Avenue corner Bayanihan Street, Clark Freeport Zone, Pampanga. The Company is a wholly owned subsidiary of Sumitomo Wiring Systems, Ltd. (SWS or the Parent Company), a company organized in Japan, and the ultimate parent company is Sumitomo Electric Industries, Ltd. (SEI), a company also organized in Japan.\n\nThe primary purpose of the Company is (1) the establishment and operation of technical center designing automotive wiring harness and other related automotive components; (2) design and development of automotive electrical, electronic and mechanical components, computer software, and software development of business processes and related systems support for its affiliate companies, both domestic and overseas but not engaging in electrical engineering profession; and (3) management activities in the aspect of quality, cost and delivery of automotive wire harness materials for its domestic and overseas affiliate companies.\n\nAs a registered enterprise under Clark Freeport Zone Authority (CFZ), the Company is entitled to the five percent (5%) special tax on gross income under section 2 of R.A. No. 9400 earned in lieu of national and local taxes.\n\nSATAC and SWS entered into an Intangibles Licensing Agreement, whereby the former shall use the intangible property of the latter. As consideration, the SATAC shall pay royalties to the SWS.\n\nSince the royalty expense is only incurred as the service is rendered, it is recorded as part of the Company's cost of services.\n\nCosts of services and general and administrative expenses are expenditures that arise in the course of the ordinary operations of SATAC. Cost of services include direct labor, depreciation of service equipment, utilities, and communication, supplies and other expenses related to services. Such costs are recognized when the related sales have been recognized. General and administrative expenses constitute costs of administering the business and are recognized in profit or loss as incurred.\n\nIn reply, please be informed that Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 16-99 implementing Section 12 (c) of Republic Act (RA) No. 7227, otherwise known as the \"Bases Conversion and Development Act of 1992,\" as amended by RA 9400, allows enterprises registered in the Subic Special Economic and Freeport Zone to deduct royalty payments when calculating gross income subject to the 5% final tax. Section 3 thereof modifies the definition of \"gross income earned,\" as follows:\n\n\"SECTION 3. Section 3 of Revenue Regulations No. 1-95 is hereby amended by adding paragraph (4) under sub-section (o) thereof and by adding thereto a sub-section (p), to read as follows:\n\n'o. Gross Income Earned. \u2014 . . .\n\n1) xxx xxx xxx\n\n2) xxx xxx xxx\n\n3) xxx xxx xxx\n\n4) Subic Bay Regional Enterprise. \u2014 For purposes of this paragraph, the term \"Gross income earned\" refers to the gross sales or gross revenues derived from the business activity within the zone, net of sales discounts and sales returns and allowances and minus the costs of sales or direct costs and other costs that are material in the operations of the business and involves a significant amount in determining the profitability and viability of the business (but before any deduction for administrative expenses or incidental losses during a given taxable period). For financial enterprises, gross income shall include interest income, gains from sales, and other income, net of allowable deductions. The following deductions shall be allowable for the calculation of gross income earned for the following specific types of enterprises:\n\n(a) xxx xxx xxx\n\n(b) Service enterprises\n\nDirect salaries\n\nService supervision salaries\n\nDirect Materials, supplies used or resold to another SBMA registered enterprise\n\nDepreciation of machineries, equipment and buildings owned and/or constructed\n\nEquipment lease payments\n\nFinancing Charges associated with fixed assets\n\nRent and utility charges for buildings and capital\n\nEquipment\n\nCorporate management salaries\n\nAdministrative salaries\n\nMarketing and sales salaries\n\nAdvertising\n\nResearch & Development\n\nRoyalty Fees\n\nTravel and Entertainment expenses\n\nCommunication expenses\n\nOutside Professional Services\n\nInterest & financial charges on working capital\n\nLoss on foreign exchange translation'\" (Emphasis supplied) [1]\n\nBased on the abovementioned Revenue Regulations, SBMA-registered Service enterprises are entitled to deduct Royalty Fees in calculating their gross income earned during a given taxable period.\n\nIn view of the foregoing, this Office holds that the royalties being paid by SATAC is deductible in computing gross income subject to the 5% preferential tax rate as defined under Section 12 (c) of RA No. 7227 and implemented by RR No. 16-99, provided that the agreement that gave rise to the royalty payment is actually and fully substantiated and provided further that the corresponding withholding taxes thereon are duly paid.\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be ascertained that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R.

The employer is required to withhold the income tax corresponding to the income actually received as salaries by an employee found to be illegally dismissed, from the time he was reinstated (if he opts to be reinstated instead of separation). However, the illegally dismissed employee is accorded special treatment, i.e., he is allowed to allocate or spread his backwages, allowances and benefits through the years he was suspended from service, having been denied payment of his wages when they were due because of circumstance not of his own making and, therefore, beyond his control. [1]\n\nSection 2.57 (B) of Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 2-98, as amended, provides as follows:\n\n\"Section 2.57. Withholding Tax at Source. \u2014\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(B) Creditable Withholding Tax. \u2014 Under the creditable withholding tax system, taxes withheld on certain income payments are intended to equal or at least approximate the tax due of the payee on said income. The income recipient is still required to file an income tax return, as prescribed in Sections 51 and 52 of the NIRC, as amended, to report the income and/or pay the difference between the tax withheld and the tax due on the income. Taxes withheld on income payments covered by the expanded withholding tax (referred to in Sec. 2.57.2 of these regulations) and compensation income (referred to in Sec. 2.78 also of these regulations) are creditable in nature.\" (emphasis supplied)\n\nWhether an employee found to be illegally dismissed is reinstated or opts for separation he is required to report such income (backwages) for the years he was suspended from service, as he files and pays his corresponding income tax thereon by allocating or spreading his backwages, allowances and benefits through the years from the time of his suspension to actual reinstatement or actual separation (if he opts for separation instead of reinstatement), as the case may be, crediting in the process the corresponding income tax withheld from said wage payments. [2]\n\nThe interpretation of tax provisions of the NIRC of 1997, as amended, embodied in RMC No. 39-2012 is an exercise of the Bureau's quasi-legislative function. This position is well grounded on Section 4 of the NIRC of 1997, as amended, viz.:\n\n\"Section 4. Power of the Commissioner to Interpret Tax Laws and to Decide Tax Cases. \u2014 The power to interpret the provisions of this Code and other tax laws shall be under the exclusive and original jurisdiction of the Commissioner, subject to review by the Secretary of Finance.\n\nxxx xxx xxx\"\n\nThe rules and regulations that the Bureau promulgates, which are the product of a delegated legislative power to create new and additional legal provisions that have the effect of law, should be within the scope of the statutory authority granted by the legislature to the administrative agency. It is required that the regulation be germane to the objects and purposes of the law, and be not in contradiction to, but in conformity with, the standards prescribed by law. They must conform to and be consistent with the provisions of the enabling statute in order for such rule or regulation to be valid. [3]\n\nIn view of the foregoing, the requested policy ruling that categorically excludes backwages awarded from a judgment of illegal dismissal from the ambit of gross taxable income is not legally feasible as it would contradict the provisions of the NIRC of 1997, as amended.\n\nPlease be guided accordingly.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.)

Gavasan\nAttorney-In-Fact\n\nGentlemen :\n\nThis refers to your letter dated July 20, 2020 requesting for a ruling on the proper treatment of Section 12 of Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 12-2018.\n\nIt is represented that Mr. Ernesto Ruiz Hidalgo (Ernesto), Mr. Eduardo Ruiz Hidalgo (Eduardo) and Ms. Maria Susan Pilar Hidalgo Batac (Maria Susan) are the surviving heirs of the late Carmen Zamora Hidalgo. Carmen Zamora Hidalgo (Carmen) left a parcel of land located in Guadalupe, Carmen, Davao del Norte with Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. __________ consisting of thirty-nine thousand five hundred eighty square meters (39,580 sq.m). To settle the estate, Ernesto, Eduardo and Maria Susan executed an Extrajudicial Settlement of Estate with Waiver of Rights on October 1, 2019 wherein Eduardo and Maria Susan renounced their share in favor of Ernesto. During the processing of the transfer of ownership of the land title and upon reaching the Registry of Deeds (RD) of Davao del Norte, the latter required the presentation of proof for the payment of donor's tax. Hence this request.\n\nIn reply, please be informed of Section 12 of RR No. 12-2018 provides, viz.:\n\n\"Sec. 12. THE LAW THAT GOVERNS THE IMPOSITION OF DONOR'S TAX.\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\nRenunciation by the surviving spouse of his/her share in the conjugal partnership or absolute community after the dissolution of the marriage in favor of the heirs of the deceased spouse or any other person/s is subject to donor's tax whereas general renunciation by an heir, including the surviving spouse, of his/her share in the hereditary estate left by the decedent is not subject to donor's tax, unless specifically and categorically done in favor of identified heir/s to the exclusion or disadvantage of the other co-heirs in the hereditary estate.\"\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\nApplying the above-quoted provision of RR No. 12-2018 in the instant case, while Eduardo and Maria Susan renounced their inheritance specifically and categorically in favor of Ernesto, it was not made to the exclusion or disadvantage of other co-heirs in the hereditary estate.\n\nArticle 777 of the New Civil Code (NCC) of the Philippines, as amended, provides that the rights to succession are transmitted from the moment of death of the decedent. However, the heirs have a right to either accept or repudiate the inheritance. Such is a voluntary and free act.\n\nUpon Carmen's death, the right to accept and repudiate the inheritance from Carmen was transmitted to her legal heirs. By executing an Extrajudicial Settlement of Estate with Waiver of Rights, Eduardo and Maria Susan exercised their respective rights to the inheritance. In doing so, it is as if Eduardo and Maria Susan were never heirs of the late Carmen in respect to the Davao del Norte property since the law clearly provides that the effect of acceptance or repudiation shall always retroact to the moment of death of the decedent. When Eduardo and Maria Susan repudiated their respective shares on the inheritance, they did not donate the property which had never become theirs. Accordingly, the repudiation is not subject to donor's tax imposed under Section 98 of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) of 1997, as amended.\n\nPursuant to Articles 1018 and 1019 of the NCC, as amended, renunciation or repudiation gives rise to accretion and the share of the one who renounces his part in the inheritance shall accrue to that of his co-heirs in the same proportion that he inherits. Thus, when Eduardo and Maria Susan executed Extrajudicial Settlement of Estate with Waiver of Rights, accretion had effectively taken place in favor of Ernesto such that the renounced inheritance is added or incorporated to Ernesto's share.\n\nIn view of the foregoing, the pro indiviso share of Eduardo and Maria Susan in the Davao del Norte property will be transferred from the estate of Carmen directly to Ernesto. It is incorrect to construe that the Eduardo and Maria Susan acquired their pro indiviso shares in the Davao del Norte property and subsequently donated the same to Ernesto. There can be no donation as the property was never transferred to Eduardo and Maria Susan. Consequently, since there is no donation, no donor's tax may be assessed on the transaction. The case is different when there are other co-heirs left aside from Ernesto, and despite of the presence of other co-heirs, Eduardo and Maria Susan chose to renounce only in favor of Ernesto to the exclusion of other co-heirs because in such a case, Eduardo and Maria Susan are deemed to have accepted their inheritance and donated the same to Ernesto.\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be ascertained that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R. DULAY\nCommissioner of Internal Revenue",

Diosdado Macapagal Ave.\nCCP Complex, Pasay City\n\nAttention: Mr. Gilbert F. Santa Maria\nPresident & CEO\n\nGentlemen :\n\nThis refers to your letter dated October 23, 2020 requesting for confirmation that the sale of real properties owned by Philippine Airlines, Inc. (\"PAL\" for brevity) and being held for investment purposes is subject to the 6% capital gains tax (CGT) and the documentary stamp tax (DST) on conveyance of real property and exempt from the value-added tax (VAT).\n\nBackground:\n\nPAL is a domestic corporation duly registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) with Company Reg. No. __________. It was also registered with the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) with TIN No. __________ under Line of Business Nos. __________ as international air passenger transport and _____ as domestic air passenger transport.\n\nThe purposes for which PAL was formed are \"to engage in transport services for the transportation of passengers, express parcels, mail merchandise and freight by air, and all other services of a similar character which may from time to time be deemed advisable, to establish, purchase, own, acquire, operate and generally turn to account, airlines, operates aerial taxi, aerial advertising and sightseeing services, to own, purchase, construct, lease, operate and dispose of airports, hangars, transportation depots; aircraft service stations and agencies, and other objects and service of a similar nature which may be necessary, convenient or useful as an auxiliary to its transportation service, to service and repair aircraft and generally deal in all kinds of airplanes, seaplanes, oil, fuel, aircraft accessories and equipment and goods, wares and merchandise necessary for its transportation service, and to purchase, rent or otherwise acquire, to hold, own, mortgage, pledge, assign, transfer, lease or otherwise encumber or dispose of any property, right or interest which may be in any way connected with or useful to the business conducted by the Corporation, to borrow and lend money in aid of the Company's corporate purposes, and for such purposes, to issue, receive and hold bonds, notes and other obligations; to appoint subject at all times to the supervision and control of the Board of Directors, a manager or managers, to attend to the proper conduct of the business of the corporation, and further to engage in all other acts and business which may be necessary or convenient in the furtherance of the air transportation business, including but not limited to the management of operations of, or investment in hotels, restaurants, cafes and amusement enterprises of all kinds and generally dealing in and with all facilities and appurtenances desirable or appropriate in the conduct of the foregoing activities.\"\n\nPAL is the registered owner of six (6) parcels of land without any improvements constructed thereon, all located in Barangay Yapak, Municipality of Malay, Province of Aklan, (hereinafter referred to as the \"Subject Properties\") which are specifically described, as follows:\n\nTransfer Certificate of Title Nos.\n\nTax Declaration Nos.\n\nArea (in Sq.m.)\n\nClassification\n\n_______________\n\n_______________\n\n17,470\n\nAgricultural\n\n_______________\n\n_______________\n\n1,412\n\nResidential\n\n_______________\n\n_______________\n\n115,611\n\nAgricultural\n\n_______________\n\n_______________\n\n6,238\n\nAgricultural\n\n_______________\n\n_______________\n\n5,166\n\nAgricultural\n\n_______________\n\n_______________\n\n23,312\n\nAgricultural\n\nThe Subject Properties were lodged under \"Non-current Assets\" caption of PAL's Audited Financial Statement with the account title \"Investment Properties.\" The Subject Properties remain idle and undeveloped and were never used in trade or business by PAL.\n\nOn August 25, 2020, a Contract to Sell was executed between PAL, as the Vendor, and Golden TW Realty & Development Corporation, as the Vendee, whereby the latter offered to purchase from the Vendor the Subject Properties on an \"as is where is basis,\" and the Vendor accepted such offer to purchase.\n\nThe issue is whether or not the Subject Properties are capital assets of PAL.\n\nIn reply, please be informed that the term \"capital asset\" as negatively defined in Section 39 (A) (1) of the National Internal Revenue Code (Tax Code) of 1997, as amended, means property held by the taxpayer (whether or not connected with his trade or business), but does not include stock in trade of the taxpayer or other property of a kind which would properly be included in the inventory of the taxpayer if on hand at the close of the taxable year, or property held by the taxpayer primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of his trade or business, or property used in the trade or business, of a character which is subject to the allowance for depreciation provided in Subsection (F) of Section 34, or real property used in trade or business of the taxpayer.\n\nAn idle property may be classified as capital asset or ordinary asset. Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 7-2003, particularly Section 3 (e) thereof, provides to wit:\n\n\"SEC. 3. GUIDELINES IN DETERMINING WHETHER A PARTICULAR REAL PROPERTY IS A CAPITAL ASSET OR ORDINARY ASSET. \u2014\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\ne. Treatment of abandoned and idle real properties. \u2014 Real properties formerly forming part of the stock in trade of a taxpayer engaged in the real estate business, or formerly being used in the trade or business of a taxpayer engaged or not engaged in the real estate business, which were later on abandoned and became idle, shall continue to be treated as ordinary assets. Real property initially acquired by a taxpayer engaged in the real estate business shall not result in its conversion into a capital asset even if the same is subsequently abandoned or becomes idle.\n\nProvided however, that properties classified as ordinary assets for being used in business by a taxpayer engaged in business other than real estate business as defined in Section 2(g) hereof are automatically converted into capital assets upon showing of proof that the same have not been used in business for more than two (2) years prior to the consummation of the taxable transactions involving said properties. (Emphasis supplied)\n\nBased on the above, an idle property classified as ordinary asset is automatically converted into capital asset upon showing of proof that the same has not been used in business for more than two (2) years prior to the consummation of the taxable transaction involving said properties. The automatic conversion of property into capital asset provided in RR No. 7-2003, however, is not necessary when the idle real property is considered capital asset from the moment it was acquired. The Subject Properties were registered in the name of PAL in 2017 and were acquired for investment purposes and recorded by PAL as capital assets. The properties were never used in the course of trade or business of PAL, or depreciated for that purposes. No improvements were introduced to the Subject Properties as certified by the Provincial Assessor's Office of the Province of Aklan and Barangay Chairman of Barangay Yapak, Municipality of Malay, Province of Aklan. More importantly, PAL is engaged in air transportation of passengers and cargoes and not in the real estate business.\n\nIn view of the foregoing, and considering that PAL is a taxpayer not engaged in the real estate business, being not a real estate dealer, developer or lessor and was organized as an airline company; that the Subject Properties have been idle and vacant (for more than two years) as shown, aside from the pictures submitted, by the Certifications of the Provincial Assessor's Office of the Province of Aklan and Barangay Chairman of Barangay Yapak, Municipality of Malay, Province of Aklan that there are no improvements nor structures erected on the Subject Properties; and that the Subject Properties have been treated in the books of accounts and are reflected in the audited financial statement as investment properties and have not been used in the ordinary course of trade or business, it is the considered opinion of this Office that the Subject Properties described above are classified as capital assets, the conveyance of which is subject only to the CGT under Section 27 (D) (5) of the Tax Code and DST under Section 196 of the same Code, and shall not be subject to VAT under Section 106 of the same Code (BIR Ruling Nos. 187-2017 dated April 17, 2017; 634-2017 dated December 19, 2017 and 480-2017 dated October 18, 2017; VAT-0404-2020 dated July 23, 2020).\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be disclosed that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R.

9337, provides for the exemption from VAT on the sale or importation of frozen fruits and vegetables. The aforesaid provision reads, viz.:\n\n\"SEC. 109. Exempt Transactions. \u2014 (1) Subject to the provisions of subsection (2) hereof, the following transactions shall be exempt from the value-added tax:\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\nA) Sale or importation of agricultural and marine food products in their original state, livestock and poultry of a kind generally used as, or yielding or producing foods for human consumption; and breeding stock and genetic materials therefor.\"\n\n\"Products classified under this paragraph and paragraph (a) shall be considered in their original state even if they have undergone the simple processes of preparation or preservation for the market, such as freezing, drying, salting, broiling, roasting, smoking or stripping. Polished and/or husked rice, corn grits, raw cane sugar and molasses, and ordinary salt shall be considered in their original state.\"\n\nBased on the above-cited provision, the importation and distribution/sale of agricultural products in their original state for human consumption, is considered exempt from 12% VAT pursuant to Section 109 (1) (A) of the Tax Code, as amended. Agricultural products are considered remaining in their original state even if these have undergone the simple process of preparation or preservation for the market, such as freezing, drying, salting, broiling, roasting, or stripping. The type of processing is limited to the aforementioned simple processes. Otherwise, the same may no longer be considered agricultural product in its original state. Moreover, the VAT exemption is limited in application \u2014 it refers only to such products which are intended as food for human consumption.\n\nIn view of the foregoing, since frozen fruits and vegetables are basically an agricultural product in its original state and intended for human consumption, the importation and distribution/sale thereof by HEALTHY TOP HARVEST DISTRIBUTION, INC. is exempt from the twelve percent (12%) VAT pursuant to Section 109 (1) (A) of the Tax Code, as amended. It is understood that the importation of such product shall be covered by valid and existing authority to import issued by the Bureau of Plant Industry.\n\nHowever, products which undergo the processes which are by no means simple acts of preparation or preservation as the same already partake the nature of a full manufacturing process which transforms fruits, etc. into an entirely different form such as into purees or concentrate are not covered by Section 109 (1) (A) of the Tax Code, as amended. Such being the case, your request for exemption from VAT on the sale and/or importation of the below products is hereby denied and the sale and/or importation of the same is subject to twelve percent (12%) VAT imposed under Sections 106 (A) and 107 (A) of the Tax Code, as amended.\n\nProduct\n\nType\n\nOrigin\n\nAcai Puree\n\nIndividual Quick Frozen Fruit Puree\n\nVarious Countries\n\nAvocado Puree\n\nIndividual Quick Frozen Fruit Puree\n\nVarious Countries\n\nBanana Puree\n\nIndividual Quick Frozen Fruit Puree\n\nVarious Countries\n\nMango Puree\n\nIndividual Quick Frozen Fruit Puree\n\nVarious Countries\n\nStrawberry Puree\n\nIndividual Quick Frozen Fruit Puree\n\nVarious Countries\n\nKiwi Puree\n\nIndividual Quick Frozen Fruit Puree\n\nVarious Countries\n\nRaspberry Puree\n\nIndividual Quick Frozen Fruit Puree\n\nVarious Countries\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be disclosed that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R.

Alvina\nExecutive Director\n\nGentlemen :\n\nThis refers to your letter dated September 24, 2020, requesting for clarification regarding the imposition of income tax on local government units (LGUs) engaged in the operation of local economic enterprises, pursuant to Section 22 (d) of Republic Act (RA) No. 7160 or the Local Government Code (LGC) of 1991.\n\nBackground:\n\nThe Municipal Mayor of the Municipality of Baao, Camarines Sur, relayed in his letter addressed to the Bureau of Local Government Finance of the Department of Finance dated February 10, 2020 that the BIR Revenue District Office (RDO) No. 66, Iriga City, requested for the payment of income taxes from the market rental fees being paid to the said LGU in view of the alleged proprietary business operated by the Municipality of Baao. The OIC-Revenue District Officer of RDO No. 66 expressed in her letter to the Municipal Mayor of Baao dated December 26, 2019 that the tax exemption privilege granted to LGUs only include the income derived from public utilities or from the exercise of any essential government function accruing to the government by virtue of Section 32 (B) (7) of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) of 1997, as amended, thus, the liability of the said municipality to pay the taxes due from its proprietary functions.\n\nIn reply, please be informed that Section 27 (C) of the NIRC, as amended by Republic Act (R.A.) No. 10963, provides:\n\n\"SEC. 27. Rates of Income Tax on Domestic Corporations. \u2014\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(C) Government-owned or Controlled Corporations, Agencies or Instrumentalities. \u2014 The provisions of existing special or general laws to the contrary notwithstanding, all corporations, agencies, or instrumentalities owned or controlled by the Government, except the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS), the Social Security System (SSS), the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PHIC), and the local water districts shall pay such rate of tax upon their taxable income as are imposed by this Section upon corporations or associations engaged in a similar business, industry, or activity.\"\n\nOn the other hand, Section 32 (B) (7) (b) of the NIRC, as amended, likewise provides, viz.:\n\n\"SEC. 32. Gross Income. \u2014\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(B) Exclusions from Gross Income. \u2014 The following items shall not be included in gross income and shall be exempt from taxation under this Title:\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(7) Miscellaneous Items.\n\n(b) Income Derived by the Government or its Political Subdivisions. \u2014 Income derived from any public utility or from the exercise of any essential governmental function accruing to the Government of the Philippines or to any political subdivision thereof.\"\n\nUnder Sec. 27 (C) of the NIRC, government-owned or controlled corporations, agencies or instrumentalities of the government are no longer exempt from taxation and shall be liable to pay such rate of tax upon their taxable income as are imposed upon corporations or associations engaged in similar business, industry or activity, except the GSIS, SSS, PHIC, and Local Water Districts. While on the other hand, Section 32 (B) (7) (b) of the NIRC, as amended, excludes from the gross income and exempts from income tax, the income derived from the discharge of any essential governmental functions accruing to the Government of the Philippines or to any of its political subdivisions. It is necessary then to determine whether or not the income from market rental fees received by the Municipality of Baao, Camarines Sur was derived in the performance of its essential governmental function.\n\nThere is no hard and fast rule for purposes of determining the true nature of an undertaking or function of a provincial, city, or a municipal corporation (LGUs). The surrounding circumstances of a particular case are to be considered and would be decisive. \"The basic element, however beneficial to the public the undertaking may be, is that it is governmental in essence, otherwise, the function becomes private or proprietary in character\" (Torio vs. Fontanilla, 85 SCRA 602 (1978)). It has been established though that an instrumentality of the government which acts for the purpose of accomplishing government policies and objectives and extending essential services to the people performs governmental and not proprietary functions (Peoples' Homesite and Housing Corporation vs. Court of Industrial Relations, 150 SCRA 296, 310 (1987)) (BIR Ruling No. 369-11 dated October 5, 2011)\n\nIn Angat River Irrigation System, et al. vs. Angat River Workers' Union, et al., 102 Phil. 789, 796-797 (1957), the Supreme Court made a distinction between acts in the performance of a government function and those in the performance of a corporate or proprietary function and held that:\n\n\"As ordinarily constituted, municipal corporations (and this may be said of the National Government) have dual character, the one governmental, legislative, or public; the other, proprietary or private. In their public capacity, a responsibility exists in the performance of acts for the public benefit, and in this respect, they are merely a part of the machinery of government of the sovereignty creating them, and the authority of the state is supreme. But in their PROPRIETARY or private character their powers are supposed to be conferred not from considerations of state, but for the private advantage of the particular corporation as a distinct legal personality (Bouvier's Law Dictionary, 3rd revision, vol. II, p. 2270).\n\nIn its governmental or public character, the corporation is made by the state one of its instruments, or the local depository of certain limited and prescribed political powers, to be exercised for the public good in behalf of the state rather than for itself. But in its proprietary or private character, the theory is that the powers were supposed not to be conferred primarily or chiefly from considerations connected with the government of the state at large, but for the private advantage of the compact community which is incorporated as a distinct legal personality or corporate individual; and as to such powers, and to property acquired and contracts made thereunder, the corporation is frequently regarded as having the rights and obligations of a private rather than those of a public corporation. (Trenton vs. New Jersey, 262 US 182, 67 L Ed. 937, 29 ALR 1471)\n\nThe governmental functions of a municipal corporation or a local government unit are those conferred or imposed upon it as a local agency, to be exercised not only in the interest of its inhabitants, but also in the advancement of the public good and welfare as affecting the public generally (37 Am. Jur. 727).\n\nThe distinction between acts in the performance of a governmental function and those in the performance of a corporate or proprietary function is that in the case of the former, the municipal corporation is executing a legislative mandate with respect to a public duty generally, while in the other, it is exercising its private rights as a corporate body. (Loeb vs. Jacksonville, 101 Fla. 429, 69 ALR 459)\"\n\nFurthermore, RR No. 18-2012 dated December 28, 2012 defines government proprietary function, as follows:\n\n\"x x x when a public corporation or a local government unit acts in its proprietary character, it is regarded as having the rights and obligations of a private corporation. For government entities to be taxable, the following requisites must concur: (1) the government entity concerned must not be performing an essential governmental function; and (2) it must be engaged in similar business, industry, or activity as performed by other ordinary taxable corporations. All income realized from or received in the exercise of its proprietary functions shall be subject to income tax and business taxes in the same manner as other private corporations similarly situated. All income realized from or received in the exercise of its proprietary functions shall be subject to income tax and business taxes in the same manner as other private corporations similarly situated.\" (Underscoring supplied)\n\nIn BIR Ruling No. 369-11 dated October 5, 2011, it has been established that provincial, city and municipal governments are liable to income tax in the performance of their corporate or proprietary functions since the tax exemption privileges, including preferential tax treatment of all government units, i.e., the National Government, its agencies and political subdivisions, as well as government-owned or controlled corporations were withdrawn by Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1931 (1984) and Executive Order No. 93 (1987).\n\nIt is to be noted that governmental functions are those pertaining to the administration of government, and as such, are treated as absolute obligation on the part of the state to perform, while proprietary functions are those that are undertaken only by way of advancing the general interest of society, and merely optional on the government.\n\nFrom the foregoing, this Office is of the opinion that the Municipality of Baao, Camarines Sur, in leasing out its property (market spaces) and receiving rental fees thereof, acted in its proprietary or private character since no governmental or public policy of the state was involved. As a corporation, the Municipality of Baao, Camarines Sur enjoys full autonomy in the exercise of its economic enterprises, subject to the limitations provided in the Local Government Code of 1991 and other applicable laws (Local Government Code, Sec. 22 (d)). When a public corporation or a local government unit acts in its proprietary character, it is regarded as having the rights and obligations of a private corporation. Therefore, the income from market rental fees will not fall under the exclusions from gross income under Section 32 (B) (7) of the NIRC, as amended, and shall be subject to income tax in the same manner as other private corporations similarly situated (Sison vs. Ancheta, 130 SCRA 654, 664 (1984)). (BIR Ruling Nos. 239-2014 dated June 25, 2014 and 471-2018 dated March 13, 2018)\n\nTime and again, this Office has established that provincial, city and municipal governments are liable for income tax in the performance of their corporate or proprietary functions because the tax exemption privileges, including preferential tax treatment of all government units, i.e., the National Government, its agencies and political subdivisions as well as government-owned or controlled corporations, were withdrawn by Presidential Decree No. 1931 (1984) and Executive Order No. 93 (1987). There is no reason to depart from these rulings. (BIR Ruling No. 369-2011 dated October 5, 2011)\n\nFinally, the Municipality of Baao, Camarines Sur shall apply for an Authority to Print (ATP) in the printing of their receipts or invoices and pay the Annual Registration Fee, pursuant to Sections 238 and 236, respectively, of the NIRC, as amended, and implemented by RR No. 18-2012 dated October 22, 2012.\n\nPlease be guided accordingly.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.)

Mabale\nAdministrator\n\nMadam :\n\nThis refers to your letter dated February 20, 2020 requesting for a confirmatory ruling on the tax exemption relative to the importation of dairy animals.\n\nIt is represented that the National Dairy Authority (NDA) purchased one thousand eight-hundred fifty seven (1,857) dairy animals from Australian Rural Exports, Pty, Ltd. (AREPL) through General Mercantile Company, Inc., (GEMCO), detailed as follows:\n\nNumber of Heads\n\nDescription\n\n717 heads\n\nHolstein X Jersey Heifers (Pregnant)\n\n50 heads\n\nPurebred Holstein Heifers (Pregnant)\n\n375 heads\n\nHolstein X Jersey Heifer Crosses (50:50) (Pregnant)\n\n565 heads\n\nHolstein X Jersey Heifers (Pregnant)\n\n150 heads\n\nPurebred Holstein Heifers (Pregnant)\n\nTotal: 1,857 heads\n\nThe transaction had been exempted from customs duties by the Department of Finance (DOF) by virtue of the Customs Modernization and Tariff Act. However, the DOF did not include from the exemption the payment of value-added tax (VAT) incidental to the importation. Thus, this request.\n\nIn reply, please be informed that Section 109 (1) (A) of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) of 1997, as amended, provides that:\n\n\"Sec. 109. Exempt Transactions. \u2014\n\n(1) Subject to the provisions of Subsections (2) hereof, the following transactions shall be exempt from the value-added tax:\n\n(A) Sale or importation of agricultural and marine food products in their original state, livestock and poultry of a kind generally used as, or yielding or producing foods for human consumption; and breeding stock and genetic materials therefor.\"\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\nBased from the abovementioned provision, the exemption on VAT extends to sale or importation of livestock [1] which includes, among others, cows, bulls and calves.\n\nThe NDA is mandated to serve as the central policy determining and directing body tasked to ensure the accelerated development of the Philippine dairy industry. [2] Accordingly, one of their function is to assist in the purchase, importation, propagation, storage distribution and sale of dairy animals, semen, forage seeds, fertilizers veterinary supplies, dairy equipment and engineering supplies and such other inputs as may be needed by the dairy industry [3] wherein the transaction was grounded.\n\nIn view of the foregoing, this Office hereby confirms that the importation by NDA of the One Thousand Eight-Hundred Fifty-Seven (1,857) dairy animals is exempt from VAT pursuant to Section 109 (1) (A) of the NIRC of 1997, as amended, subject to the conditions enshrined in Section 18 of the National Dairy Development Act of 1995. Please note that the tax exemption granted herein is only limited to such transaction.\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be disclosed that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R.

Mape, EVP\nChief Financial Officer\n\nGentlemen :\n\nThis refers to your letter dated September 12, 2019 requesting for confirmation that the transfer of Manila Polo Club, Inc. (MPC) Membership share from one officer to another shall not be subject to capital gains tax (CGT), donor's tax and documentary stamp tax (DST).\n\nBackground:\n\nSecurity Bank Corporation (the \"Company\") is a domestic corporation engaged in the banking business. It provides expanded commercial banking services such as deposit products, loans and trade finance, domestic and foreign fund transfers, treasury, foreign exchange and trust services.\n\nThe Company owns shares from MPC recorded as asset in its books as of December 31, 2018. Due to MPC's policy and in order to avail of the privileges of the club, one (1) proprietary share was issued to its former President, Alberto S. Villarosa covered by Proprietary Membership Certificate No. _____. The afore-mentioned membership share is now being transferred to Sanjiv Vohra, the new President of the Company.\n\nThe Company is the beneficial owner of the MPC share under Proprietary Membership Certificate (PMC) No. 5681. The MPC share is currently under the name of the Company's Director and Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, Alberto S. Villarosa, who was designated as the authorized playing representative and signatory of the Company at the Manila Polo Club, per Assistant Corporate Secretary's Certificate dated November 5, 2002.\n\nOn October 3, 2003, Alberto S. Villarosa deposed in his unilateral Declaration of Trust that the Company has purchased a proprietary share of the Manila Polo Club, Inc. which was registered in his name to comply with the rules of MPC that only a natural person shall be admitted as a proprietary member. He further admitted that he does not have any title, right, claim or interest whatsoever over the said MPC share registered under his name.\n\nOn September 6, 2019, the Company's Assistant Corporate Secretary certified that the Company is the true and beneficial owner of one (1) proprietary share of MPC under PMC No. 5681 which appears in the name of Alberto S. Villarosa, an assignee of the Company. Furthermore, it was also certified that the Board of Directors of the Company in its regular Board meeting held on July 30, 2019, approved the lateral transfer of the aforementioned MPC share to its newly elected President and Chief Executive Officer, Sanjiv Vohra.\n\nOn September 9, 2019, Sanjiv Vohra deposed in his unilateral Declaration of Trust that the Company owns one (1) proprietary share of the Manila Polo Club, Inc., as evidenced by PMC No. 5681, formerly assigned to Alberto S. Villarosa; and that he was appointed to represent the MPC share actually owned by the Company since it is provided in the Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws of MPC that no institutional members are to be admitted as shareholder.\n\nWe reply, as follows:\n\nThe transfer of MPC Shares from Alberto S. Villarosa to Sanjiv Vohra is not subject to CGT and DST.\n\nUpon execution of the two unilateral Declarations of Trust, a trust relationship was created between the Company and Alberto S. Villarosa, on one hand, and with Sanjiv Vohra on the other.\n\nA trust is a legal relationship between one person having an equitable ownership of property and another person owning the legal title to such property, the equitable ownership of the former entitling him to the performance of certain duties and the exercise of certain powers by the latter. What distinguishes a trust from other relations is the separation of the legal title and equitable ownership of the property. In a trust relation, legal title is vested in the fiduciary while equitable ownership is vested in a cestui que trust. [1]\n\nIn relation thereto, a declaration of trust has been defined as an act by which a person acknowledges that the property, title to which he holds, is held by him for the use of another. [2]\n\nIn the Declarations of Trust which Alberto S. Villarosa and Sanjiv Vohra executed, they acknowledged that the transfer did not give them any kind of right, claim or interest whatsoever in the MPC Share and that they are holding only the legal ownership of the same with the beneficial ownership pertaining to the Company. Here, the trustor and the cestui que trust is the Company while the fiduciary, also known as the trustees, are the declarant/appointees, Albert S. Villarosa and Sanjiv Vohra.\n\nA trust arises in favor of one who pays the purchase money of property in the name of another, because of the presumption that he who pays for a thing intends a beneficial interest therein for himself. [3] The principle of a resulting trust is based on the equitable doctrine that valuable consideration, and not legal title, determines the equitable title or interest and are presumed always to have been contemplated by the parties. They arise from the nature or circumstances of the consideration involved in a transaction whereby one person thereby becomes invested with legal title but is obligated in equity to hold his legal title for the benefit of another. [4]\n\nIn the case of Sime Darby Pilipinas, Inc. v. Mendoza, [5] Sime Darby acquired a Class \"A\" club share in Alabang Country Club (\"ACC\") in 1987, but being a corporation which was expressly disallowed by ACC's By-Laws to acquire and register the club share under its name, registered the share under the name of respondent Mendoza, Sime Darby's sales manager at the time. The Supreme Court held that a trust arrangement existed between Sime Darby and Mendoza and while the share was bought by Sime Darby and placed under the name of Mendoza, the latter's title was only limited to the use and enjoyment of the club's facilities and privileges while employed with the company.\n\nIn the instant case, the Company purchased the MPC Share and intends to give legal title thereto to its trustee-appointee, which title entitles the trustee-appointee only to the use and enjoyment of the club's facilities since, under the Articles of Incorporation and By-laws of MPC, only natural persons may become registered members.\n\nThe transfer of the legal title of the MPC shares from Alberto S. Villarosa to its new trustee-appointee, is not subject to CGT considering that the transfer involves neither monetary consideration nor change in beneficial ownership.\n\nSection 24 (C) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, provides that CGT is imposed upon the net capital gains realized during the taxable year from the sale, barter, exchange or other disposition of shares of stock in a domestic corporation, except shares sold, or disposed of through the Stock Exchange. In other words, CGT is imposed on the gain or profit from the sale of capital assets. [6]\n\nIn this case, the MPC Share will be transferred from Alberto S. Villarosa's name, as the current Trustee, to Sanjiv Vohra, who will be the Company's new trustee-appointee. Since Alberto S. Villarosa only possessed legal title over the MPC Share, the transfer of the subject share in favor of Sanjiv Vohra will be limited only to the transfer of the legal title.\n\nThe intention of the Company in giving legal title of the MPC Share to Sanjiv Vohra is to make him an extension of the Company's ownership over the same. Practically speaking, being a juridical entity, the Company cannot directly enjoy the privileges that come with owning the MPC Share, hence, must assign someone to use the club facilities on its behalf.\n\nSince the beneficial ownership over the MPC Share remains with the Company, there is no actual transfer of ownership of the MPC share as between the Company and its trustees and/or from such trustees to the next trustees, and therefore, no gain or profit shall be recognized.\n\nTherefore, considering that there is no actual transfer of ownership and no monetary consideration, and consequently no gain or profit involved in the Transfer which is merely by virtue of an assignment as evidenced by the Declarations of Trust, this Office confirms that the transfer is not subject to CGT.\n\nThe Transfer is not subject to DST\n\nLikewise, the transfer is not subject to DST under Section 175 of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended. The rule is that the assignment of shares of stock of a domestic corporation is subject to DST upon execution of the deed transferring ownership or rights thereto, or upon delivery, assignment or indorsement of such shares in favor of another.\n\nRevenue Regulations (RR) No. 13-2004 dated December 23, 2004, implementing the provisions of Republic Act (RA) No. 9243, otherwise known as An Act Rationalizing Further the Structure and Administration of the Documentary Stamp Tax [7] qualified this rule by stating that for a sale or exchange to be taxable, there must be an actual or constructive transfer of beneficial ownership of the shares of stock from one person to another. Section 4 of RR No. 13-2004 provides, to wit:\n\n\"For a sale or exchange to be taxable, there must be an actual or constructive transfer of beneficial ownership of the shares of stock from one person to another. Such transfer may be manifested by the clear exercise of attributes of ownership over such stocks by the transferee, or by an actual entry of a change in the name appearing in the certificate of stock or in the Stock and Transfer Book of the issuing corporation or by any entry indicating transfer of beneficial ownership in any form of registry including those of a duly authorized scripless registry, such as those maintained for or by the Philippine Stock Exchange. However, if by the transfer of certificates of stock from a resigned trustee to a newly appointed trustee such certificate of stock remains in the name of the cestui que trust or the resigned trustee so that the new trustee is constituted as mere depository of the stock, such transfer is not taxable. Provided, however, that transfer of shares to \"nominees\" to qualify them to sit in the board or to qualify them to perform any act in relation to the corporation shall not be subject to the DST provided herein only upon proof of a duly executed Nominee Agreement showing the purpose of the transfer; that the transfer is without consideration other than the undertaking of the nominee to only represent the beneficial owner of the stock; and the transfer is in trust.\" (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)\n\nThe herein transfer comply with the afore-cited rules. First, there is no actual or constructive transfer of the beneficial ownership of the shares. Only the legal title was transferred when the Company changed its appointees from Alberto S. Villarosa to Sanjiv Vohra. Second, the execution of and by the express provisions of the Declarations of Trust, the intention of the parties was clearly for Alberto S. Villarosa and now Sanjiv Vohra to hold the share in trust for the Company.\n\nFurthermore, in the case of Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. First Express Pawnshop, Inc., [8] the Supreme Court explained that Sections 175 and 176 of the Tax Code on DST contemplates the execution of a subscription agreement in order for a taxpayer to be liable to pay the DST. The Supreme Court ruled, thus:\n\n\"As pointed out by the CTA, Sections 175 and 176 of the Tax Code contemplate a subscription agreement in order for a taxpayer to be liable to pay the DST. A subscription contract is defined as any contract for the acquisition of unissued stocks in an existing corporation or a corporation still to be formed. A stock subscription is a contract by which the subscriber agrees to take a certain number of shares of the capital stock of a corporation, paying for the same or expressly or impliedly promising to pay for the same.\"\n\nA mere transfer of a share from one trustee to another, without change in the beneficial ownership of the share is, therefore, not the taxable transaction being contemplated under the Tax Code provisions on DST. That the transfer from Alberto S. Villarosa to Sanjiv Vohra is without a subscription agreement or any kind of consideration is indicative of the real intention of the parties that there would be no transfer of beneficial ownership of the MPC Share. The same remains with the Company.\n\nIn view thereof, the herein transfers cannot be subject to DST as there are no transfer or conveyance to Sanjiv Vohra of the beneficial ownership of or any right, claim or interest over the MPC Share or over the assets of MPC. There being no new conveyance to speak of in this case, there is no new exercise of a privilege upon which DST may be imposed. Consequently, since there will be no transfer or conveyance of the MPC share from Alberto S. Villarosa to Sanjiv Vohra, the same shall not be subject to donor's tax under Section 98 of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended.\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be disclosed that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R.

Laging Handa, Quezon City 1103\n\nAttention: Atty. Victor Luis Q. Padilla II\nExecutive Director\n\nGentlemen :\n\nThis refers to your letter dated August 16, 2017 requesting for the issuance of the Certificate Authorizing Registration (CAR) pending the payment of the transfer tax liability or possible reduction thereof and legal avoidance of payment of surcharges, interest and penalties on the transfer of real property to Optical Media Board (\"OMB\").\n\nAs represented, in June 2017, Renato Ma. Avena (\"Mr. Avena\") sold and conveyed a real property located at No. 35 Scout Limbaga Street, Bgy. Laging Handa, Quezon City (\"Subject Property\") to Videogram Regulatory Board (now, OMB), a national government regulatory agency. Before the sale, the Subject Property was classified as capital asset and utilized as a residential abode. It is now utilized as the principal office of the Optical Media Board, an agency performing governmental functions catering to public service.\n\nIn reply, please be informed that the requirement of a Certificate Authorizing Registration (CAR) prior to registration with the Registry of Deeds is mandated under Section 58 (E) of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended (NIRC), which states that:\n\n\"(E) Registration with Register of Deeds. \u2014 No registration of any document transferring real property shall be effected by the Register of Deeds unless the Commissioner or his duly representative has certified that such transfer has been reported, and the capital gains or creditable withholding tax, if any, has been paid: Provided, however, That the information as may be required by rules and regulations to be prescribed by the Secretary of Finance, upon recommendation of the Commissioner, shall be annotated by the Register of Deeds in the Transfer Certificate of Title or Condominium Certificate of Title: Provided, further, That in cases of transfer of property to a corporation, pursuant to a merger, consolidation or reorganization, and where the law allows deferred recognition of income in accordance with Section 40, the information as may be required by rules and regulations to be prescribed by the Secretary of Finance, upon recommendation of the Commissioner, shall be annotated by the Register of Deeds at the back of the Transfer Certificate of Title or Condominium Certificate of Title of the real property involved: Provided, finally, That any violation of this provision by the Register of Deeds shall be subject to the penalties imposed under Section 269 of this Code.\" (emphasis supplied)\n\nPursuant to Section 24 (D) (1) of the NIRC, a six percent (6%) Capital Gains Tax (CGT) is imposed on the gains presumed to have been realized by the seller from the sale, exchange, or other disposition of capital assets located in the Philippines, including pacto de retro sales and other forms of conditional sale. Moreover, since the buyer is a government agency, the seller may opt to be taxed under Section 24 (A) of the same Code, as amended.\n\nIt must be noted that the burden of paying the six percent (6%) capital gains tax on the sale of the Subject Property classified as capital asset rests upon the seller, Mr. Avena, because he is the one who is presumed to have realized the capital gains subject to tax. Until Mr. Avena pays the CGT or the income tax on the sale of the Subject Property, no registration of the Deed of Sale transferring the Subject Property to OMB can take effect notwithstanding the fact that OMB is an agency of the government.\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be ascertained that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R. DULAY\nCommissioner of Internal Revenue",

Exempt Transactions. \u2014\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(1) Subject to the provisions of Subsection (2) hereof, the following transactions shall be exempt from the value-added tax.\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(T) [1]  Sale, importation or lease of passenger or cargo vessels and aircraft, including engine, equipment and spare parts thereof for domestic or international transport operations;\"\n\nBased on the above-cited provision, the importation, among others, of a passenger vessel destined for domestic transport operations shall be exempt from VAT. In relation thereto, Section 4.109-1 (B) (1) (t) of the Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 16-2005, as amended by RR No. 15-2015, which implements the above-quoted provision, provides:\n\n\"SECTION 4.109-1.

Hence, the importation of the said vessel by Montenegro Shipping Lines, Inc. is deemed compliant with the requirements on restriction on vessel importation and mandatory vessel retirement program of MARINA. Accordingly, the importation by Montenegro Shipping Lines, Inc. of \"MV City of Roxas\" shall be exempt from VAT pursuant to Section 109 (1) (T) of the NIRC of 1997, as amended. The VAT exemption, however, shall be subject to the strict compliance of the conditions contained in the letter of approval issued by MARINA for the importation of the subject vessel.

Thus, the documents conveying the properties shall be subject to DST imposed under Section 196 of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended, based on the consideration contracted to be paid for such realties or on their fair market value determined in accordance with Section 6 (E) of the same Code, whichever is higher.

Placido, Jr.\nand\nDennis Arvin L. Chan\n\nGentlemen :\n\nThis refers to your letter dated October 15, 2018 requesting on behalf of your client, Greenhills Properties, Inc. (GPI) for confirmation of your opinion that the merger between GPI and Lochinver Assets, Inc. (LAI) is a tax-free merger in accordance with Sections 40 (C) (2) and 6 (b) of the National Internal Revenue Code (Tax Code) of 1997, as amended.\n\nBackground\n\nGPI, with Tax Identification No. (TIN) __________ is a domestic corporation duly organized and existing, under and by virtue of Philippine laws, with office address at Unit 2002-A, East Tower, Philippine Stock Exchange Centre, Exchange Road, Ortigas Center, 1605 Pasig City, Metro Manila.\n\nGPI has authorized capital stock of ______________________________ (P__________), divided into ______________________________ (__________) common shares with a par value or One Peso (P1.00) each with the total capital stock issued and outstanding which amounts to ____________________ (P__________).\n\nAs of June 30, 2012, the carrying amounts and fair values of GPI shows total assets of __________________________________________________ total liabilities of __________________________________________________ and total stockholders' equity of ________________________________________.\n\nLAI, on the other hand, with TIN __________ was a wholly-owned subsidiary of GPI and likewise a duly registered domestic corporation prior to the subject merger which had its principal office at Unit 2002-B, East Tower, Philippine Stock Exchange Centre, Exchange Road, Ortigas Center, 1605 Pasig City, Metro Manila.\n\nLAI had an authorized capital stock of ______________________________ (P__________) divided into ____________________ shares with a par value of ____________________ (P__________) per share. The total capital stock issued and outstanding amounts to ____________________ (P__________) of which, ______________________________ (P__________) or 99% was owned by GPI.\n\nAs of June 30, 2012 the audited balance sheet of LAI shows total asset of ______________________________ (__________), total liabilities of ______________________________ (P__________) and total stockholders' equity of ______________________________ (P__________).\n\nIn order to allow the effective management of assets and to enhance economic and operational efficiency for the business involved, the constituent corporations decided to effect a merger, thus, GPI and LAI executed a Plan of Merger dated April 26, 2012. Under the said plan of merger, LAI will be the absorbed corporation and will be merged with GPI, the surviving corporation.\n\nThe Plan of Merger was approved by a majority vote of the Board of Directors and by the vote of the stockholders owning or representing at least 2/3 of its outstanding capital stock of GPI and LAI at a stockholders' meeting held on April 12, 2012.\n\nThe SEC approved the Articles and Plan of Merger on November 28, 2012, by virtue of which the SEC issued a Certificate of Filing of the Articles and Plan of Merger. Under the approved Articles and Plan of Merger, the merger shall become effective on the date when the Certificate of Merger shall have been issued and released by the SEC. Accordingly, the merger took effect on November 28, 2012 (\"Effective Date of Merger\").\n\nGPI issued a total of ______________________________ (__________) shares of stock to the stockholders of LAI, which shares are composed of ____________________ (__________) unissued authorized capital stock of GPI.\n\nBased on the foregoing representations, you now request confirmation of your opinion that \u2014\n\n1. The described merger of GPI into LAI is a tax-free merger under Section 40 (C) (2) and (6) (b) of the NIRC, such that no gain or loss shall be recognized for income tax purposes;\n\n2. The transfer of assets by LAI to GPI pursuant to the merger is not subject to value-added tax (VAT) and any unused input tax of LAI as of the effective date of the merger is absorbed by GPI, as the surviving corporation;\n\n3. The transfer of assets of LAI to GPI is likewise not subject to donor's tax for lack of donative intent on the part of SAFI;\n\n4. The transfer of real properties to GPI is not subject to documentary stamp tax (DST) under Section 199 (m) of the NIRC, as amended by Republic Act (RA) No. 9243; and\n\n5. Any excess creditable withholding tax (CWT) of LAI, as the absorbed corporation in a statutory merger, is transferred to and vested in GPI, as the surviving corporation, and such excess CWT may be utilized by the latter;\n\nIn reply thereto, please be informed, as follows:\n\n1. The foregoing merger of GPI and LAI is a merger within the contemplation of Section 40 (C) (2) (a) in relation to 40 (C) (6) (b) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, because GPI shall acquire/assume all the assets and liabilities of LAI and the same will result in economies of scale and efficiency of operations of the merging corporations, and make possible the more productive use of the properties of the constituent corporations, albeit, to the best interest of their respective stockholders. Hence, the merger of GPI and LAI is being undertaken for a bona fide business purpose and not for the purpose of escaping the burden of taxation.\n\nThe merger of GPI and LAI qualifies for non-recognition of gain or loss for income tax purposes in accordance with Section 40 (C) (2) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, that no gain or loss shall be recognized by LAI, as the transferor of all assets and liabilities, to GPI pursuant to the Plan of Merger.\n\nAccordingly, no gain or loss shall be recognized by GPI, as the transferee, on its receipt of the assets and liabilities of LAI pursuant to and as a consequence of the merger.\n\nThe basis of the properties transferred in the hands of the transferee (GPI), listed in Annex \"A\" hereof, shall be the same as it would be in the hands of the transferor (LAI) increased by the amount of the gain, if any, recognized to the transferor (LAI) on the transfer. (Sec. 40 (C) (5) (b))\n\nThe basis of the shares of stock received by the transferor (LAI) upon the exchange shall be the same as the basis of the properties, stocks or securities exchanged, decreased by (1) the money received, and (2) the fair market value of the other property received and increased by (a) the amount treated as dividend of the shareholders and (b) the amount of any gain that was recognized on the exchange. (Sec. 40 (C) (5) (a) of the Tax Code of 1997)\n\nFinally, if the amount of the liabilities assumed plus the amount of the liabilities to which the property is subject exceed the total of the adjusted basis of the properties transferred pursuant to such exchange, then such excess shall be considered as a gain, on the part of the transferor, from the sale or exchange of a capital asset or of property which is not a capital asset, as the case may be. (Sec. 40 (C) (4) (b), supra)\n\nThe substituted basis of the properties transferred by LAI to GPI shall comply with the rule that cash and other cash items will be excluded from the computation of the adjusted basis of the properties transferred for purposes of determining whether liabilities assumed and to which the property is subject do not exceed the adjusted basis of the property transferred pursuant to No. IV (A) (2) of Revenue Memorandum Ruling (RMR) No. 2-2002 dated June 10, 2002.\n\nAccordingly, the allocated shares and liabilities, and the substituted basis of the assets transferred by LAI to GPI, based on LAI's audited financial statements as of June 30, 2012 shall be as follows:\n\nAmount\n\n(in Php)\n\nAllocated Liabilities\n\nAllocated Shares\n\nSubstituted Basis (in Php)\n\nCash and Cash Equivalents\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\nPrepayments\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\nProperty, plant and equipment\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\nInvestment in properties\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\nDeferred tax assets\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\nTOTAL\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\nLiabilities\n\nAmount (in Php)\n\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses\n\n__________\n\nAdvances from Related Party\n\n__________\n\nTOTAL\n\n__________\n\n2. Section 105 of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, identifies the persons liable for the Value-Added-Tax.\n\n\"SECTION 105. Persons Liable. \u2014 Any person who, in the course of trade or business, sells, barters, exchanges, leases goods or properties, renders services, and any person who imports goods shall be subject to the value-added-tax (VAT) imposed in Sections 106 to 108 of this Code.\"\n\nHowever, Section 4.106-8 (h) (3) of Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 16-2005, as amended by RR No. 4-2007, [1] specifically excludes mergers from being subject to output tax.\n\n\"SECTION 4.106-8. Change or Cessation of Status as VAT-registered Person. \u2014\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(b) Not subject to output tax.\n\nThe VAT shall not apply to goods or properties existing as of the occurrence of the following:\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(3) Merger or consolidation of corporations. The unused input tax of the dissolved corporation, as of the date of merger or consolidation, shall be absorbed by the surviving or new corporation.\"\n\nThus, the above-mentioned transaction shall not be subject to VAT, and any unused input VAT of LAI as of the effective date of merger will be transferred to and absorbed by GPI pursuant to Section 4.106-8 (b) (3) of RR No. 16-2005, as amended, the said transfer being considered a transaction \"not subject to output tax\" under the said Section.\n\n3. Well-settled in our jurisprudence is the fact that the essential elements of a valid donation are: (1) the reduction of the patrimony of the donor, (2) the increase in the patrimony of the donee, and (3) the intent to do an act of liberality (animus donandi).\n\nClearly, there is no intention on the part of any of the parties to the merger \u2014 LAI to donate to GPI its assets since the transaction is purely for legitimate business purpose. Thus, the aforesaid merger will not be subject to gift tax since there is no intention to donate, and the transaction is a bonafide merger effected solely for business reasons.\n\n4. No DST is due on the transfer of assets made pursuant to the Plan of Merger under Section 199 (m) of the Tax Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 9243, in relation to Section 40 (C) (2) of the Tax Code, as amended. (BIR Ruling No. 100-2017 dated March 2, 2017)\n\n5. Any excess and unutilized creditable withholding taxes (CWT), which form part of the assets to be transferred by LAI as of the effective date of the merger, shall be transferred to and vested in GPI, as the surviving corporation, and such excess CWT may be utilized by the latter. (BIR Ruling No. 100-2017 dated March 2, 2017)\n\n6. DST at the rate of P1.00 on each P200 par value, or fractional part thereof, shall be imposed on the original issuance of shares by GPI to the stockholders of LAI as a consequence of the merger as provided under Section 174 of the Tax Code, as amended.\n\n7. It is to be emphasized, however, that the net operating loss carry-over (NOLCO) under Section 34 (D) (3) of the Tax Code, as amended, and as implemented by Revenue Regulations No. 14-2001, of LAI, if any, is not one of their assets that can be transferred and absorbed by the surviving corporation, GPI, as this privilege or deduction can be availed of by LAI only. Accordingly, the tax-free merger between LAI and GPI does not cover the NOLCO of the former.\n\n8. The excess and unexpired minimum corporate income tax (MCIT) of LAI, as of the effective date of the merger as of year 2012, if any, shall be carried forward and credited against the normal income tax due of GPI for the three (3) immediately succeeding taxable years pursuant to Section 27 (E) (2) of the Tax Code, as amended; and\n\n9. The retained earnings of the absorbed corporation amounting to __________________________________________________ is subject to the ten percent (10%) final withholding tax on dividends constructively received by its individual shareholders pursuant to Section 24 (B) (2) of the Tax Code. (BIR Ruling No. 1422-18 dated December 7, 2018)\n\nIn order that the above-described reorganization can be considered as merger under Section 40 (C) (2) and (6) (b) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, the parties to the merger should comply with the following requirements set forth under Revenue Regulations No. 18-2001:\n\nA. The plan of reorganization should be adopted by each of the corporations, parties thereto, the adoption being shown by the acts of its duly constituted responsible officers and appearing upon the official records of the corporation. Each corporation, which is a party to the reorganization, shall file, as part of its return for the taxable year within which the reorganization occurred a complete statement of all facts pertinent to the non-recognition of gain or loss in connection with the reorganization, including:\n\n1. A copy of the plan of reorganization, together with a statement executed under the penalties of perjury, showing in full the purposes thereof and in detail all transactions incident to, or pursuant to the plan;\n\n2. A complete statement of all cost or other basis of all property, including all stocks or securities, transferred incident to the plan;\n\n3. A statement of the amount of stock or securities and other property or money received from the exchange, including a statement of all distribution or other disposition made thereof. The amount of each kind of stock or securities and other property received shall be stated on the basis of the fair market value thereof at the date of the exchange;\n\n4. A statement of the amount and nature of any liabilities assumed upon the exchange, and the amount and nature of any liabilities to which any of the property acquired in the exchange is subject.\n\nB. Every taxpayer, other than a corporation, party to the reorganization, who received stock or securities and other property or money upon a tax-free exchange in connection with a corporate reorganization shall incorporate in his income tax return for the taxable year in which the exchange takes place a complete statement of all facts pertinent to the non-recognition of gain or loss upon such exchange, including:\n\n1. A statement of the cost or other basis of the stock or securities transferred in the exchange; and\n\n2. A statement in full of the amount of stock or securities and other property or money received from the exchange, including any liabilities assumed upon the exchange, and any liabilities to which property received is subject. The amount of each kind of stock or securities and other property (other liabilities assumed upon the exchange) received shall be set forth upon the basis of the fair market value thereof at the date of the exchange.\n\nC. Records in substantial form shall be kept by every taxpayer who participates in a tax-free exchange in connection with a corporate reorganization showing the cost or other basis of the transferred property or money received (including any liabilities assumed on the exchange, or any liabilities to which any of the properties received were subject), in order to facilitate the determination of gain or loss from subsequent disposition of such stock or securities and other property received from the exchange.\n\nIn addition to the foregoing requirements, the parties shall enclose with their respective income tax returns for the taxable year in which the merger occurred a copy of the request for ruling filed with, and the corresponding ruling issued by, the Bureau of Internal Revenue, both duly stamp-received by the appropriate office of the Bureau of Internal Revenue.\n\nSuch parties shall include as a note to their respective audited financial statements for the taxable year in which the merger occurred a statement to the effect that they hold such assets/shares acquired in a merger and the year in which such merger occurred, and in the taxable years until the subject properties are subsequently transferred to another transferee.\n\nMoreover, the shareholders of the absorbed/dissolving corporation and the surviving/transferee corporation shall record in their respective books of accounts the mandatory accounting entries stated in Annex \"B\" hereof, pursuant to Revenue Memorandum Order (RMO) No. 17-2016.\n\nFurthermore, the parties shall cause to annotate at the back of the Transfer Certificates of Title (TCT) and Certificates of Stock, the date the merger was executed, the original or historical cost of acquisition of the properties or shares of stock involved, and the fact that no gain or loss was recognized as a result of such merger; provided however, that any violation by the Register of Deeds or by the Corporate Secretary of this condition shall be penalized under Section 269 or 275, as the case may be, of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended.\n\nFinally, the parties are required to submit to the Legal and Legislative Division, Bureau of Internal Revenue, proof of annotation of the substituted basis of the shares of stock and/or real properties involved in the transfer within ninety (90) days from receipt of this ruling. Violation of this requirement is subject to the penalties provided in Section 275 of the Tax Code of 1997.\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be disclosed that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R.

[1]\n\nAs represented, on April 18, 1988, the Society of St. Columban acquired a parcel of land with improvement from BBB and her six (6) children located at No. 55 Twin Hills St., Rolling Hills Subdivision, New Manila, Quezon City, covered by Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 359233. However, because of doubts as to whether it could own a real property in the Philippines, Society of St. Columban asked the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Manila to place under its name the said property, to which the latter agreed. Thus, a Deed of Trust was executed in April 18, 1988. DETACa\n\nOn October 10, 2019, the Society of St. Columban requested the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Manila for the reconveyance of the above-mentioned parcel of land and its improvement, to which the latter agreed. Therefore, on March 4, 2020, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Manila executed a Release of Trust in favor of the Regional Director of the Missionary of St. Columban in the Philippines, Inc. conveying unto the latter the said parcel of land [TCT No. 004-RT20123009066 (381948) and Tax Declaration (TD) No. F-027-00782] and its improvement (TD No. D-027-04634). Hence, this request.\n\nIn reply, please be informed that Section 27 (D) (5) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, provides, viz.:\n\n\"SEC. 27. Rates of Income tax on Domestic Corporations. \u2014\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(D) Rates of Tax on Certain Passive Incomes. \u2014\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(5) Capital Gains Realized from the Sale, Exchange or Disposition of Lands and/or Buildings. \u2014 A final tax of six percent (6%) is hereby imposed on the gain presumed to have been realized on the sale, exchange or disposition of lands and/or buildings which are not actually used in the business of a corporation and are treated as capital assets, based on the gross selling price of fair market value as determined in accordance with Section 6(E) of this Code, whichever is higher, of such lands and/or buildings.\"\n\nUnder the above-quoted provision, capital gains presumed to have been realized from the sale, exchange, or disposition of lands and/or buildings which are not actually used in the business of the corporation and are treated as capital assets shall be taxed at the rate of 6% based on the gross selling price or the fair market value thereof, whichever is higher. In the instant case, however, there is no sale, exchange or disposition of real property involved, since the Regional Director of Missionary of St. Columban is the real owner of the subject realty, while Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Manila merely acted as trustee. The conveyance by the Trustee in favor of the Trustor of the subject properties which the former acquired by virtue of the Deed of Trust is not to be treated as another transfer separate and distinct from the sale between the original owner and the Trustee. The conveyance is merely to be treated as a continuation and confirmation of title in favor of the ultimate and real beneficiary of the subject properties. Likewise, the transaction is not predicated by a valuable consideration considering that the reconveyance is ostensibly just for return of the property to the legal owner and merely acknowledges, confirms and consolidates the legal title and beneficial ownership over the property in the name of the Regional Director of Missionary of St. Columban, the Trustor.\n\nAccordingly, the transfer of title of the afore-stated properties by the Trustee in favor of the Trustor, who is the beneficial owner thereof, is not subject to capital gains tax imposed under Sec. 27 (D) (5) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended or to the creditable withholding tax prescribed in Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 2-98, as amended, implementing Section 57 (B) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended. [2]\n\nMoreover, under Section 196 of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, the deeds or documents subject to the documentary stamp tax (DST) imposed therein are those where the realty sold shall be granted, assigned, transferred, or otherwise conveyed to a purchaser or purchasers or to any other person or persons designated by such purchaser or purchasers, thereby excluding from its purview the instant case considering that the supposed purchaser is actually the owner thereof. Also, under Section 191 of RR No. 26, otherwise known as the \"Documentary Stamp Tax Regulations,\" conveyances to a trust without valuable consideration, or from a trustee to a cestui que trust without valuable consideration are not subject to tax. Since the reconveyance of the afore-stated properties by the Trustee in favor of the Regional Director of Missionary of St. Columban is a transfer of ownership to the real owner thereof in connection and in recognition of a trust, the said transfer, therefore, is not subject to the DST imposed under Section 196 of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended. However, the notarial acknowledgment to the Release of Trust is subject to the P30.00 DST as imposed under Section 188 of the same Code.\n\nFurthermore, Section 98 of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended provides that donor's tax is generally imposed on the transfer by any person, resident or non-resident, of property by gift. The donor's tax applies, whether such transfer is in trust or otherwise, whether the gift is direct or indirect, and whether the property is real or personal, tangible or intangible. The essential elements of a valid donation are: (1) the reduction of the patrimony of the donor, (2) the increase in the patrimony of the donee, and (3) the intent to do an act of liberality (animus donandi). In this case, however, there is no intention to donate on the part of the Trustee since the reconveyance merely transfers the ownership of the subject realty to the true buyer/owner. Hence, the transfer of the properties to the Regional Director of Missionary of St. Columban by the Trustee is exempt from the donor's tax imposed under Section 98 of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended.\n\nFinally, the reconveyance is not subject to value-added tax (VAT) because the said realty is not held primarily for sale to customers or for lease in the ordinary course of business. [3] aDSIHc\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be ascertained that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R.

Hermin E. Arceo\n\nGentlemen :\n\nThis refers to your letter dated December 18, 2017 requesting on behalf of the Estate of Orencio E. Gabriel for an extension of time within which to pay the estate tax thereon.\n\nAs represented, Orencio E. Gabriel (TIN: __________), with residence at ____________________, died on June 20, 2017 at St. Luke's Medical Center. Rizal Drive cor. 32nd St. and 5th Ave., Bonifacio Global City, Fort Bonifacio, Taguig City, Metro Manila, leaving some properties, assets and rights. You claim that the financial position of the decedent's heir, namely the surviving widow, Jennifer C. Gabriel, demonstrates the incapability to pay the estate taxes. As there is a Petition for Judicial Settlement of the estate filed in court, you request for a period of five (5) years extension within which to pay the aforesaid estate taxes.\n\nIn reply thereto, please be informed that Section 91 (B) of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended provides, viz.:\n\n\"SEC. 91. Payment of tax. \u2014\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(B) Extension of Time. \u2014 When the Commissioner finds that the payment on the due date of the estate tax or of any part thereof would impose undue hardship upon the estate or any of the heirs, he may extend the time for payment of such tax or any part thereof not to exceed five (5) years, in case the estate is settled through the courts, or two (2) years in case the estate is settled extrajudicially. In such case, the amount in respect of which the extension is granted shall be paid on or before the date of the expiration of the period of the extension, and the running of the Statute of Limitations for assessment as provided in Section 203 of this Code shall be suspended for the period of any such extension.\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\nIf an extension is granted, the Commissioner may require the executor, or administrator, or beneficiary, as the case may be, to furnish a bond in such amount, not exceeding double the amount of the tax and with such sureties as the Commissioner deems necessary, conditioned upon the payment of the said tax in accordance with the terms of the extension.\"\n\nBased on the foregoing justifiable reasons, your request for extension of time within which to pay the estate tax of Orencio E. Gabriel is hereby granted up to the maximum period of five (5) years, reckoned from actual filing of the return or on December 20, 2017, whichever comes first, provided that the executor, or administrator, or beneficiary, shall furnish a bond in such amount, not exceeding double the amount of the balance of the estate tax and with such sureties as the Commissioner deems necessary, conditioned upon the payment of the said tax in accordance with the terms of the extension.\n\nIt shall be understood, however, that the estate shall be liable for the corresponding interest that shall have accrued thereon up to the time of payment of the estate tax due on the transmission by the said estate of its properties in favor of the heirs pursuant to Section 249 of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended.\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be ascertained that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R.

Maria, Bulacan; that based on the Certification dated January 28, 2020 issued by Engr. Artemio S. Tomacruz, Jr. of the Municipal Agrarian Reform Office of the Department of Agriculture (DA), Cluster 5-Balagtas, Bocaue, Marilao, City of Meycauayan, Obando, City of San Jose del Monte, Sta. Maria and Pandi, HHH is the Agricultural Lessee (Leaseholder) over a parcel of land owned by III represented by JJJ located at Brgy. San Gabriel, Sta. Maria, Bulacan, with an area of Twenty Thousand (20,000) square meters, more or less; that based on the same Certification, BBB (son of HHH) became his father's successor as tenant over the part/portion of the subject parcel of land which is now covered by TCT No. T-441589 (M); and that the Landowners and BBB agreed to terminate the above-mentioned tenancy relationship, thus, on November 27, 2019, a Deed of Assignment with Release, Waiver and Quitclaim was executed by the Landowners in favor of BBB, whereby the former transferred and conveyed, by way of disturbance compensation, to the latter a portion of TCT No. T-441589 (M) with an area of One Thousand Eight Hundred Twenty-Four (1,824) square meters. Hence, this request.\n\nIn reply, please be informed that Section 66 of Republic Act (RA) No. 6657 otherwise known as the \"Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law of 1988\" states that:\n\n\"Section 66. Exemptions from Taxes and Fees of Land Transfers. \u2014 Transactions under this Act involving a transfer of ownership, whether from natural or juridical persons, shall be exempted from taxes arising from capital gains. These transactions shall also be exempted from the payment of registration fees, and all other taxes and fees for the conveyance or transfer thereof; provided, that all arrearages in real property taxes, without penalty or interest, shall be deductible from the compensation to which the owner may be entitled.\"\n\nThese transactions include, among others, transfer of land to a tenant as disturbance compensation as a result of extinguishment of tenancy relationship by reason of the reclassification or conversion of the agricultural land into non-agricultural uses or purposes enunciated in Section 36 (1) of RA No. 3844, as amended, viz.:\n\n\"Section 36. Possession of Landholding; Exceptions. \u2014 Notwithstanding any agreement as to the period or future surrender, of the land, an agricultural lessee shall continue in the enjoyment and possession of his landholding, except when his dispossession has been authorized by the Court in a judgment that is final and executory if after due hearing it is shown that:\n\n(1) The landholding is declared by the department head upon recommendation of the National Planning Commission to be suited for residential, commercial, industrial or some other urban purposes: Provided, That the agricultural lessee shall be entitled to disturbance compensation equivalent to five times the average of the gross harvests on his landholding during the last five preceding calendar years;\" (emphasis ours)\n\nOnly Section 35 of RA No. 3844 was expressly repealed by RA No. 6657. Hence, disturbance compensation given to a tenant due to the extinguishment of tenancy relationship by reason of reclassification or conversion of the agricultural land into non-agricultural uses, pursuant to Section 36 of RA No. 3844, as amended, is still considered one of the transactions contemplated under Section 66 of RA No. 6657. [1]\n\nHowever, in this case, while the parties agreed to terminate their agricultural tenancy relationship and convert the agricultural landholding into residential, commercial or industrial purposes, nothing on the documents presented show that the land was declared by the proper authorities as suited for residential, commercial, industrial or some other urban purposes. In the absence of any proof showing that the subject parcel of land has already been converted into non-agricultural uses, the transfer of the same by way of disturbance compensation is not covered by RA No. 6657.\n\nPlease take note that \"[a] tax exemption represents a loss of revenue to the State and must therefore not be lightly granted or inferred. When claimed, it must be strictly construed against the taxpayer, who must prove that he comes under the exemption rather than the rule that everyone must contribute his just share in the maintenance of the government.\" [2] \"He who claims tax exemptions must be able to justify his claim or right.\" [3]\n\nIn view of the foregoing, your request for exemption from CGT cannot be sustained as the facts established is not in accordance with what the law requires. To rule otherwise would undermine the prevailing principles for the sake of expediency.\n\nAlso, the conveyance, being a disposition of real property under Section 24 (D) (1) of the 1997 Tax Code, as amended, is likewise subject to the documentary stamp taxes imposed under Section 188 and Section 196 of the same Code. SDAaTC\n\nPlease be guided accordingly.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R. DULAY\nCommissioner of Internal Revenue\n\n1. BIR Ruling No. 353-19 dated June 20, 2019.\n\n2.

Moreover, it is subject to the corresponding internal revenue taxes imposed under the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC)of 1997, as amended, on its income derived from any of its properties, real or personal, or any activity conducted for profit, which income should be returned for taxation, unless said revenues are actually, directly and exclusively used for educational purposes.\n\nFurther, if Brent International School, Baguio, Inc. is engaged in the sale of goods or services in the course of a business pursuit, including transactions incidental thereto, in general, it shall be liable for 12% value-added tax (VAT) on the revenues derived therefrom if the gross receipts from such sales exceed Three Million Pesos (P3,000,000.00),[1] or to 3% percentage tax, if gross receipts do not exceed P3,000,000.00.\n\nMoreover, its purchase of goods or properties or services and importation of goods shall nevertheless be subject to the 12% VAT pursuant to Sections 106 and 107 of the NIRC of 1997, notwithstanding that it is a non-stock, non-profit corporation.\n\nConsidering the above, we cannot grant your request since the revenues derived from the aforesaid Christmas bazaar were not shown to have been actually, directly and exclusively used for educational purposes and are therefore not exempted from income tax and VAT.\n\nPlease be guided accordingly.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.)

DETACa\n\nBackground\n\nDAIICHI is a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the Philippines with Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Company Registration No. 165096000 and Tax Identification Number (TIN) 000-000-000-000, having its principal place of business at Third Floor, One World Place, 32nd St., City Center North, Bonifacio Global City, Taguig City. DAIICHI was organized primarily to deal, engage, invest and transact, directly or indirectly, in all forms of business and mercantile acts and transactions concerning all kinds of real property, including but not limited to the acquisition, development, utilization, and disposition of residential, commercial and industrial property and concerning all kinds of personal property.\n\nDAIICHI has an authorized capital stock of _________________________ Pesos (P__________), divided into Two Billion Two Hundred Eighty Million (2,280,000,000) Class A shares and One Billion Five Hundred Twenty Million (1,520,000,000) Class B shares with a par value of __________ (P_____) per share, of which Two Billion Two Hundred Fifty Million (2,250,000,000) shares are subscribed, fully paid and outstanding.\n\nAs of June 30, 2019, the carrying amounts and fair values of DAIICHI shows total assets of _________________________ Pesos (P__________), total liabilities of _________________________ Pesos (P__________) and total stockholders' equity of _________________________ (P__________).\n\nGRAND ARCIS, on the other hand, is a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the Philippines with SEC Company Registration No. CS201408183 and TIN 000-000-000-000, having its principal place of business at 3rd Floor, Lot 7 Block 5, 32nd St., City Center North, Bonifacio Global City, Taguig City. GRAND ARCIS was organized primarily to carry on business as a holding company, including but not limited to, the acquisition by purchase, exchange, assignment, gift, importation or otherwise, and to hold, own and use for investment or otherwise, and to sell, assign, transfer, exchange, mortgage, pledge, traffic or otherwise, to enjoy and dispose of all types of property including but not limited to land, condominium units, buildings, machineries, equipment, bonds, debentures, promissory notes, shares of capital stock, or other securities or obligations, created, negotiated or issued by any corporation, association, or other equity, foreign or domestic and while the owner thereof, to exercise all rights, powers and privileges of ownership, including the right to receive, collect and dispose of, any and all dividends, rentals, interest and income, derived therefrom and generally perform acts or things designed to promote, protect, preserve, improve or enhance the value of any or such properties to the extent permitted by law, but not acting as a broker or dealer of securities.\n\nGRAND ARCIS has an authorized capital stock of _________________________ Pesos (P__________), divided into Two Hundred Fifty Million (250,000,000) shares with a par value of __________ (P_____) per share, of which One Hundred Million (100,000,000) shares are subscribed, fully paid and outstanding.\n\nAs of June 30, 2019 the audited balance sheet of GRAND ARCIS shows total asset of _________________________ Pesos (P__________), total liabilities of _________________________ Pesos (P__________) and total stockholders' equity of _________________________ Pesos (P__________).\n\nFinally, GRAND FORTIS, is a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the Philippines with SEC Company Registration No. CS201408184 and TIN 000-000-000-000, having its principal place of business at 3rd Floor, Lot 7 Block 5, 32nd St., City Center North, Bonifacio Global City, Taguig City. GRAND FORTIS was organized primarily to carry on business as a holding company, including but not limited to, the acquisition by purchase, exchange, assignment, gift, importation or otherwise, and to hold, own and use for investment or otherwise, and to sell, assign, transfer, exchange, mortgage, pledge, traffic or otherwise, to enjoy and dispose of all types of property including but not limited to land, condominium units, buildings, machineries, equipment, bonds, debentures, promissory notes, shares of capital stock, or other securities or obligations, created, negotiated or issued by any corporation, association, or other equity, foreign or domestic and while the owner thereof, to exercise all rights, powers and privileges of ownership, including the right to receive, collect and dispose of, any and all dividends, rentals, interest and income, derived therefrom and generally perform acts or things designed to promote, protect, preserve, improve or enhance the value of any or such properties to the extent permitted by law, but not acting as a broker or dealer of securities.\n\nGRAND FORTIS has an authorized capital stock of _________________________ Pesos (P__________), divided into Two Hundred Fifty Million (250,000,000) shares with a par value of __________ (P_____) per share, of which One Hundred Million (100,000,000) shares are subscribed, fully paid and outstanding.\n\nAs of June 30, 2019, the audited balance sheet of GRAND FORTIS shows total assets of _________________________ Pesos (P__________), total liabilities of _________________________ Pesos (P__________) and total stockholders' equity of _________________________ Pesos (P__________). aDSIHc\n\nIn order to enhance economic and operational efficiency for the business involved, the constituent corporations decided to effect a merger, thus, DAIICHI, GRAND ARCIS and GRAND FORTIS executed a Plan of Merger dated September 5, 2019. Under the said plan of merger GRAND ARCIS and GRAND FORTIS will be the absorbed corporations and will be merged with DAIICHI, the surviving corporation.\n\nThe Plan of Merger was approved by the stockholders of DAIICHI representing at least 2/3 of its outstanding capital stock at a special stockholders' meeting held on July 29, 2019, and was approved by the stockholders of GRAND ARCIS and GRAND FORTIS representing at least 2/3 of its outstanding capital stock at a special stockholders' meeting both held on July 29, 2019.\n\nThe SEC approved the Articles and Plan of Merger on December 27, 2019, by virtue of which the SEC issued a Certificate of Filing of the Articles and Plan of Merger. Under the approved Articles and Plan of Merger, the merger shall become effective on the date when the Certificate of Merger shall have been issued and released by the SEC. Accordingly, the merger took effect on December 27, 2019 (\"Effective Date of Merger\").\n\nPursuant to the Plan of Merger, DAIICHI will issue a total of Ninety Million Five Thousand Three Hundred Twelve (90,005,312) Class A shares of stock to the stockholders of GRAND ARCIS and a total of Ninety-Two Million Two Hundred Sixty-Eight Thousand One Hundred Sixty-Three (92,268,163) Class A shares of Stock to the stockholders of GRAND FORTIS, which shares are composed of One Billion Five Hundred Fifty Million (1,550,000,000) unissued authorized capital stock of DAIICHI.\n\nBased on the foregoing representations, you now request for your confirmation that:\n\n1. The statutory merger of DAIICHI, GRAND ARCIS and GRAND FORTIS qualifies for non-recognition of gain or loss for income tax purposes in accordance with Sections 40 (C) (2) in relation to 40 (C) (6) (b) of the Tax Code. Therefore, no gain or loss shall be recognized by DAIICHI, GRAND ARCIS and GRAND FORTIS on the transfer of all assets and assumption of liabilities pursuant to the Articles and Plan of Merger, and neither DAIICHI, GRAND ARCIS and GRAND FORTIS will be subject to income tax, withholding tax, or capital gains tax on the transfer.\n\n2. The transfer of assets by GRAND ARCIS and GRAND FORTIS to DAIICHI pursuant to the merger is not subject to DST under Section 199 (e) and (m) of the Tax Code.\n\n3. The surrender by the GRAND ARCIS and GRAND FORTIS Shareholders of their DAIICHI shares pursuant to the merger is not subject to DST.\n\n4. The DST at the rate of P2.00 on each P200 par value, or fractional part thereof, shall be imposed on the following: (a) original issuance of DAIICHI shares in favor of the GRAND ARCIS and GRAND FORTIS Shareholders as a consequence of the merger; and (b) issuance of DAIICHI shares that were previously owned by GRAND ARCIS and GRAND FORTIS and were reacquired by DAIICHI as a consequence of the merger, in favor of the GRAND ARCIS and GRAND FORTIS Shareholders.\n\n5. The transfer of assets by GRAND ARCIS and GRAND FORTIS to DAIICHI will not be considered as a transfer of property for an insufficient consideration subject to Donor's Tax since there is no intention to donate on the part of GRAND ARCIS and GRAND FORTIS and that the merger was undertaken purely for legitimate business purposes.\n\n6. The transfer of assets by GRAND ARCIS and GRAND FORTIS to DAIICHI pursuant to the merger is not subject to value-added tax (VAT).\n\n7. Since the legal and beneficial ownership of excess creditable withholding taxes were effectively transferred to DAIICHI as a consequence of the merger, DAIICHI as the surviving corporation is now entitled to exercise all the attributes of ownership over them. Hence, DAIICHI is entitled to carry forward and apply these excess creditable withholding taxes as credit against its Minimum Corporate Income Tax (MCIT) or regular corporate income tax liabilities.\n\nIn reply thereto, please be informed as follows:\n\n1. The foregoing merger of GRAND ARCIS, GRAND FORTIS and DAIICHI is a merger within the contemplation of Section 40 (C) (2), in relation to Section 40 (C) (6) (b) of the Tax Code, as amended, because DAIICHI shall acquire/assume all the assets and liabilities of the Absorbed Corporations and the same is necessary and advisable and is to the advantage and welfare of the merging corporations and their respective stockholders since the corporations own, hold, and manage various assets for the same beneficial owner. Hence, the merger of GAHI, GFHI and DAIICHI is being undertaken for a bona fide business purpose and not for the purpose of escaping the burden of taxation.\n\nThe merger of GRAND ARCIS, GRAND FORTIS and DAIICHI qualifies for non-recognition of gain or loss for income tax purposes in accordance with Section 40 (C) (2) of the Tax Code, as amended, in that no gain or loss shall be recognized by GRAND ARCIS and GRAND FORTIS, as the transferors of all assets and liabilities, to DAIICHI pursuant to the Articles and Plan of Merger. ETHIDa\n\nAccordingly, no gain or loss shall be recognized by DAIICHI, as the transferee, on its receipt of the assets and liabilities of GRAND ARCIS and GRAND FORTIS pursuant to and as a consequence of the merger.\n\nThe basis of the shares of stocks to be received by the Shareholders of GRAND ARCIS and GRAND FORTIS upon the exchange shall be the same as the basis of the properties, stocks or securities exchanged, decreased by (1) the money received, and (2) the fair market value of the other property/ies received and increased by (a) the amount treated as dividend of the shareholders and (b) the amount of any gain that was recognized in the exchange. (Sec. 40 (C) (5) (a) of the Tax Code)\n\nThe basis of the property transferred in the hands of the transferee (DAIICHI), listed in Annex \"A\" hereof, shall be the same as it would be in the hands of the transferors (GRAND ARCIS and GRAND FORTIS) increased by the amount of the gain, if any, recognized to the transferors on the transfer. (Sec. 40 (C) (5) (b), supra)\n\nIf the amount of the liabilities assumed plus the amount of the liabilities to which the property is subject exceed the total of the adjusted basis of the property transferred pursuant to such exchange, then such excess shall be considered as a gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset or of property which is not a capital asset, as the case may be. (Sec. 40 (C) (4) (b), supra)\n\nThe substituted bases of the properties transferred by of GRAND ARCIS and GRAND FORTIS to DAIICHI should strictly comply with the rule that cash and other cash items will be excluded from the computation of the adjusted bases of the properties transferred for purposes of determining whether liabilities assumed and to which the property is subject do not exceed the adjusted basis of the property transferred, pursuant to No. IV (A) (2) of Revenue Memorandum Ruling (RMR) No. 2-2002 dated June 10, 2002.\n\nAccordingly, the allocated shares and the substituted basis of the properties transferred by of GRAND ARCIS and GRAND FORTIS shall be as follows:\n\nGrand Arcis Holdings, Inc.\n\nAssets\n\nAmount\n\nAllocated Liabilities\n\nAllocated Shares\n\nSubstituted Basis\n\nCash in banks\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\nPrepaid Expense\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\nInput value-added tax\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\nInvestment property (TCT No. 164-2019000287)\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\nTotal\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\nLiabilities\n\nAmount\n\nAccrued expenses\n\n__________\n\nDue to a stockholder\n\n__________\n\nTotal\n\n__________\n\nGrand Fortis Holdings, Inc.\n\nAssets\n\nAmount\n\nAllocated Liabilities\n\nAllocated Shares\n\nSubstituted Basis\n\nCash in banks\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\nPrepaid Expense\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\nInput value-added tax\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\nInvestment property (TCT No. 164-2019000287)\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\nTotal\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\n__________\n\nLiabilities\n\nAmount\n\nAccrued expenses\n\n__________\n\nDue to a stockholder\n\n__________\n\nTotal\n\n__________\n\n2. No DST is due on the transfer of assets of GRAND ARCIS and GRAND FORTIS to DAIICHI pursuant to the Articles and Plan of Merger under Section 199 (m) of the Tax Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 9243, in relation to Section 40 (C) (2) of the Tax Code, as amended.\n\nNo DST is due on the surrender by the Shareholders of GRAND ARCIS and GRAND FORTIS of their shares of stock for cancellation pursuant to the merger under Section 199 (m) of the Tax Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 9243, in relation to Section 40 (C) (2) of the Tax Code, as amended.\n\nPursuant to Section 174 of the Tax Code, as amended, DST at the rate of P2.00 on each P200 par value, or fractional part thereof, shall be imposed on the following: (a) original issuance of DAIICHI shares in favor of the Shareholders of GRAND ARCIS and GRAND FORTIS as a consequence of the merger. cSEDTC\n\n3. Well-settled in our jurisprudence is the fact that the essential elements of a valid donation are: (1) the reduction of the patrimony of the donor; (2) the increase in the patrimony of the donee; and (3) the intent to do an act of liberality (animus donandi).\n\nClearly, there is no intention on the part of GRAND ARCIS and GRAND FORTIS to donate to DAIICHI their assets since the transaction is purely for a legitimate business purpose. Thus, the merger will not be subject to donor's tax since there is no intention to donate, and the transaction is a bona fide merger effected solely for business reasons.\n\n4. The transfer of assets/properties of GRAND ARCIS and GRAND FORTIS to DAIICHI as a consequence of merger is not subject to value-added tax (VAT) pursuant to Section 105 of the Tax Code, as amended. The transfer of assets/properties to effectuate a merger is not made in the course of business but by operation of law pursuant to the merger.\n\nThe excess and unutilized creditable withholding taxes (CWT) of the absorbed corporations, of GRAND ARCIS and GRAND FORTIS, as of the effective date of the merger, if any, may be applied as a tax credit by DAIICHI against its income tax due for the taxable year 2019, the effective date of the merger being December 27, 2019, and in the succeeding taxable years, or may be the subject of a claim for refund or issuance of a tax credit certificate (TCC).\n\n5. It is to be emphasized, however, that the net operating loss carry-over (NOLCO), under Section 34 (D) (3) of the Tax Code, and as implemented by RR No. 14-2001, of the Tax Code, of the Absorbed Corporations, if any, is not one of the assets of the latter that can be transferred and absorbed by the surviving corporation, as this privilege or deduction can be availed of by the absorbed corporation only. Accordingly, the tax-free merger between GAHI and GFHI and DAIICHI does not cover the NOLCO of the former.\n\nHowever, in order that the above-described reorganization can be considered as merger under Section 40 (C) (2) and (6) (b) of the Tax Code, the parties to the merger should comply with the following requirements set forth under Revenue Regulations No. 18-2001:\n\nA. The plan of reorganization should be adopted by each of the corporations, parties thereto, the adoption being shown by the acts of its duly constituted responsible officers and appearing upon the official records of the corporation. Each corporation, which is a party to the reorganization, shall file, as part of its return for the taxable year within which the reorganization occurred a complete statement of all facts pertinent to the non-recognition of gain or loss in connection with the reorganization, including:\n\n1. A copy of the plan of reorganization, together with a statement executed under the penalties of perjury, showing in full the purposes thereof and in detail all transactions incident to, or pursuant to the plan;\n\n2. A complete statement of all cost or other basis of all property, including all stocks or securities, transferred incident to the plan;\n\n3. A statement of the amount of stock or securities and other property or money received from the exchange, including a statement of all distribution of other disposition made thereof. The amount of each kind of stock or securities and other property received shall be stated on the basis of the fair market value thereof at the date of the exchange;\n\n4. A statement of the amount and nature of any liabilities assumed upon the exchange, and the amount and nature of any liabilities to which any of the property acquired in the exchange is subject.\n\nB. Every taxpayer, other than a corporation, party to the reorganization, who received stock or securities and other property or money upon a tax-free exchange in connection with a corporate reorganization shall incorporate in his income tax return for the taxable year in which the exchange takes place a complete statement of all facts pertinent to the non-recognition of gain or loss upon such exchange, including:\n\n1. A statement of the cost or other basis of the stock or securities transferred in the exchange; and\n\n2. A statement in full of the amount of stock or securities and other property or money received from the exchange, including any liabilities assumed upon the exchange, and any liabilities to which property received is subject. The amount of each kind of stock or securities and other property (other liabilities assumed upon the exchange) received shall be set forth upon the basis of the fair market value thereof at the date of the exchange.\n\nC. Records in substantial form shall be kept by every taxpayer who participates in a tax-free exchange in connection with a corporate reorganization showing the cost or other basis of the transferred property or money received (including any liabilities assumed on the exchange, or any liabilities to which any of the properties received were subject), in order to facilitate the determination of gain or loss from subsequent disposition of such stock or securities and other property received from the exchange.\n\nIn addition to the foregoing requirements, the parties shall enclose with their respective income tax returns for the taxable year in which the tax-free exchange occurred a copy of the request for ruling filed with, and the corresponding ruling issued by the Bureau of Internal Revenue, both duly stamped received by the appropriate office of the Bureau of Internal Revenue. Such persons shall include as a note to their respective audited financial statements for the taxable year in which the exchange occurred a statement to the effect that they hold such assets/shares acquired in a tax-free exchange and the year in which such exchange occurred, and in the taxable years until the subject properties are subsequently transferred to another transferee. SDAaTC\n\nMoreover, the shareholders of both of GRAND ARCIS and GRAND FORTIS shall record in their respective books of accounts the mandatory accounting entries stated in Annex \"B\" hereof, pursuant to Revenue Memorandum Order No. 17-2016.\n\nThe parties shall cause to annotate at the back of the Transfer Certificates of Title and Certificates of Stock, as the case may be, the date the deed of exchange was executed, the original or historical cost of acquisition of the properties or shares of stock involved, and the fact that no gain or loss was recognized as a result of such exchange; provided however, that any violation by the Corporate Secretary of this condition shall be penalized under Section 275 of the same Code. It is further required that within ninety (90) days from receipt of this ruling, the parties to the transaction must submit to the Law and Legislative Division, Bureau of Internal Revenue, certified true copies by the Corporate Secretary, of duly annotated Certificates of Stock, in respect of the shares of stock of transferee corporation, including the allocation of shares and computation of the substituted bases of the properties which shall be in accordance with RMR No. 2-2002.\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be disclosed that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R. DULAY\nCommissioner of Internal Revenue",

Ibarra\nCounselor-at Law\n1008 Paragon Plaza, EDSA cor. Reliance St.,\nMandaluyong City\n\nDear Atty. Ibarra :\n\nThis refers to your letter request on behalf of your client, Grand Alliance Holdings Corp. (\"GAHC\" for brevity), for confirmation that the sale of real property held by GAHC for investment purposes is subject to the 6% capital gains tax under Section 27 (D) (5) and documentary stamp tax under Section 196, both of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, but is not subject to creditable withholding tax and value-added tax (VAT).\n\nIt is represented that GAHC is a domestic corporation with principal place of business at 8F Basic Petroleum Bldg. C, Palanca St., Legaspi Village, Makati City. It is duly registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on March 6, 2000. It is also registered with the BIR on June 27, 2000 with TIN __________ under Line of Business 7499 or as engaged in N.E.C activities.\n\nIt is organized as a holding company and its primary purpose is \"to purchase, subscribe for or otherwise acquire and own, hold, use, manage, develop, sell, assign, transfer, mortgage, pledge, exchange or otherwise dispose of real and personal property of every kind and description, including but not limited to shares of stock, debentures, notes, evidences of indebtedness and other securities, contracts and obligations of any corporation or corporations, association or associations, domestic or foreign, and to pay therefore in whole or in part, in cash or by exchanging therefore stocks, bonds or other evidences of indebtedness or securities of this or any other corporation while the owner or holder of any such real or personal property, to collect, receive, and dispose of the interest, dividends and income arising from such property and to possess and exercise in respect thereof all the rights, powers and privileges of ownership, including all voting powers of any stock so owned without however engaging in dealership in securities or in the stock brokerage business or in the business of an investment company under the investment company act and to do any act designed to protect, preserve, improve or enhance the value of any real or personal property at any time held or controlled by the corporation or in which at that time be interested;\"\n\nAs a holding company, GAHC did not engage in real estate business nor advertise or hold itself out in public as engaged in buying and selling of real estate properties. On April 2, 2014, GAHC acquired a residential house and lot (\"subject property\") located at No. 17 Kawayan St. North Forbes Park, Makati City for investment purposes only, and not for sale or for lease in the ordinary course of business. The subject property is covered by Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. __________ issued by the Registry of Deeds of Makati City with an area of 1,542 square meters, more or less and Tax Declaration Nos. _____ and _____ issued by the City Assessor of Makati City.\n\nSince its acquisition, the subject property was not developed nor utilized by GAHC in its operations. It has been reported in the Audited Financial Statements (AFS) of GAHC as \"Investment Properties.\" As disclosed in Note 6 of the Notes to Financial Statement, the Company purchased land and building in Makati City which was booked under Investment Properties in taxable year 2014. To prove the non-use of the subject real property for business purposes, the concerned Barangay issued a certification stating such fact.\n\nGAHC executed a Deed of Absolute Sale over the subject property located at No. 17 Kawayan St. North Forbes Park, Makati City in favor of SGOC Holdings Corporation. The corresponding taxes due on the sale of the said property were already paid. Hence, this query on whether or not the subject property owned by GAHC for investment and capital appreciation purposes is considered capital asset.\n\nIn reply, please be informed that the term \"capital asset\" as negatively defined in Section 39 (A) (1) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, means property held by the taxpayer (whether or not connected with his trade or business), but does not include stock in trade of the taxpayer or other property of a kind which would properly be included in the inventory of the taxpayer if on hand at the close of the taxable year, or property held by the taxpayer primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of his trade or business, or property used in the trade or business, of a character which is subject to the allowance for depreciation provided in Subsection (F) of Section 34, or real property used in trade or business of the taxpayer.\n\nAn idle property may be classified as capital or ordinary asset. Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 7-2003, particularly Section 3 (e) thereof, provides to wit:\n\n\"SEC. 3. GUIDELINES IN DETERMINING WHETHER A PARTICULAR REAL PROPERTY IS A CAPITAL ASSET OR ORDINARY ASSET. \u2014\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\ne. Treatment of abandoned and idle real properties. \u2014 Real properties formerly forming part of the stock in trade of a taxpayer engaged in the real estate business, or formerly being used in the trade or business of a taxpayer engaged or not engaged in the real estate business, which were later on abandoned and became idle, shall continue to be treated as ordinary assets. Real property initially acquired by a taxpayer engaged in the real estate business shall not result in its conversion into a capital asset even if the same is subsequently abandoned or becomes idle.\n\nProvided however, that properties classified as ordinary assets for being used in business by a taxpayer engaged in business other than real estate business as defined in Section 2(g) hereof are automatically converted into capital assets upon showing of proof that the same have not been used in business for more than two (2) years prior to the consummation of the taxable transactions involving said properties.\" (Emphasis supplied)\n\nBased on the above, an idle property classified as ordinary asset is automatically converted into capital asset upon showing of proof that the same has not been used in business for more than two (2) years prior to the consummation of the taxable transaction involving said properties. The automatic conversion of property into capital asset provided in RR No. 7-2003, however, is not necessary when the idle real property is considered capital asset from the moment it was acquired. In the instant case, the subject property was acquired for investment purposes and recorded/reported by GAHC as capital asset. The property was never used in the course of trade or business of GAHC, or depreciated for that purposes. The concerned Barangay also issued a Certification of non-Use of the subject property for business purposes. More importantly, GAHC is not engaged in the real estate business. In fact, GAHC did not operate from the time it was incorporated and thus, it has no income-generating activity.\n\nIn view of the foregoing, and considering that GAHC is a taxpayer not engaged in the real estate business, being not a real estate dealer, developer or lessor and was organized as a holding company; that the concerned Barangay Chairman where the property is located issued a Certification as to the non-use of the subject property for business purposes; and that the property has been treated in the books of accounts and is reflected in the audited financial statement as investment property and has not been used in the ordinary course of trade or business, it is the considered opinion of this Office that the subject property described above is classified as capital asset, the conveyance of which is subject to capital gains tax and documentary stamp tax but not subject to VAT and creditable withholding tax. (BIR Ruling Nos. 187-2017 dated April 17, 2017; 634-2017 dated December 19, 2017 and 480-2017 dated October 18, 2017)\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be disclosed that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R. DULAY\nCommissioner of Internal Revenue",

Valdez\nPresident\n\nGentlemen :\n\nThis refers to your letter dated October 12, 2018, applying on behalf of GOLDEN WEST COLLEGES, INC. for tax exemption certificate being enjoyed by non-stock, non-profit corporation or association under Section 30 (H) of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) of 1997, as amended. HTcADC\n\nIt is represented that GOLDEN WEST COLLEGES, INC. with BIR Taxpayer's Identification No. (TIN) __________, is a non-stock, non-profit corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the Republic of the Philippines; that it is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under Company Registration No. ____________; and that the purposes for which the corporation was incorporated is \"to establish and operate an educational institution or learning center which shall provide courses of study in Medical, Teacher Education, Technological, Computer, Criminology, Accountancy, Commerce, Engineering, All TESDA Courses, Elementary and Secondary Courses.\"\n\nIn reply, please be informed that Section 30 of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended, enumerates the non-stock and/or non-profit corporations/associations/organizations that are exempt from income tax in respect to income received by them as such. Section 30 (H) of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended, provides, viz.:\n\n\"Sec. 30. Exemptions from Tax on Corporations. \u2014 The following organizations shall not be taxed under this Title in respect to income received by them as such:\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(H) A non-stock and non-profit educational institution;\"\n\nxxx xxx xxx\"\n\n\"Non-stock\" means \"no part of its income is distributable as dividends to its members, trustees, or officers\" and that any profit \"obtained as an incident to its operations shall, whenever necessary or proper, be used for the furtherance of the purpose or purposes for which the corporation was organized.\" [1] \"Non-profit\" means that \"no net income or asset accrues to or benefits any member or specific person, with all the net income or asset devoted to the institution's purposes and all its activities conducted not for profit.\" [2]\n\nRevenue Memorandum Circular (RMC) No. 51-2014 has clarified that in order for an entity to qualify as a non-stock and/or non-profit corporation/association/organization exempt from income tax under Section 30 of the NIRC of 1997, as amended, its earnings or assets shall not inure to the benefit of any of its trustees, organizers, officers, members or any specific person. The following are considered \"increments\" of such nature:\n\n1. The payment of compensation, salaries, or honorarium to its trustees or organizers; x x x.\n\nIn the submitted documents of GOLDEN WEST COLLEGES, INC., it was disclosed that the members of the Board of Trustees are entitled to compensation. The Certification executed by GOLDEN WEST COLLEGES, INC.'s President, Domini Valdez, dated August 2, 2019, shows that Deogracias Valdez, being a member of Board of Trustees, received a monthly compensation of ___________________.\n\nThe payment of compensation to the members of the Board of Trustees is considered a distribution of the equity (including the net income) of GOLDEN WEST COLLEGES, INC. This is a form of private inurement which the law prohibits in the organization and operation of a non-stock, non-profit corporation. This act violates the requirement that no part of the net income or assets of the corporation shall inure to the benefit of any individual or specific person. Thus, GOLDEN WEST COLLEGES, INC. cannot be qualified as a non-stock, non-profit corporation under Section 30 (H) of the NIRC of 1997, as amended.\n\nPlease bear in mind that, \"being a non-stock and/or non-profit corporation does not, by this reason alone, completely exempt an institution from tax.\" [3] Thus, \"statutes granting tax exemptions are construed strictissimi juris against the taxpayer and liberally in favor of the taxing authority. A claim of tax exemption must be clearly shown and based on language in law too plain to be mistaken. Otherwise stated, taxation is the rule, exemption is the exception. The burden of proof rests upon the party claiming the exemption to prove that it is in fact covered by the exemption so claimed.\" [4] (BIR Ruling No. 466-2014 dated November 19, 2014)\n\nIn view of the foregoing, the request of GOLDEN WEST COLLEGES, INC. to be exempted from income tax on its income as a Section 30 (H) corporation is hereby denied as it failed to prove that it is a non-profit corporation. Therefore, GOLDEN WEST COLLEGES, INC. shall be treated as an ordinary corporation subject to thirty percent (30%) income tax rate pursuant to Section 27 (A) and other internal revenue taxes imposed by the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended.\n\nPlease be guided accordingly. aScITE\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.)

It is represented that you have been a regular employee of Fluor Daniel, Inc.-Philippines since January 5, 2012 and that you are to retire from said employment by January 2020. Further, it is your opinion that Republic Act (RA) No. 7641 has superseded RA No. 4917 thus, effectively decreasing the required years of service of the employee to avail of the aforesaid tax exemption from ten (10) years to five (5) years. HTcADC\n\nWe reply as follows:\n\nRA No. 4917 entitled, \"An Act Providing that Retirement Benefits of Employees of Private Firms Shall Not be Subject to Attachment, Levy, Execution, or Any Tax Whatsoever,\" provides that retirement benefits of employees of private firms shall not be subject to any tax when the employer has a \"reasonable retirement benefit plan,\" and that the retiring official or employee has been in the service of the same employer for at least ten (10) years and is not less than fifty (50) years of age at the time of his retirement, to wit:\n\nSection 1. Any provision of law to the contrary notwithstanding, the retirement benefits received by officials and employees of private firms, whether individual or corporate, in accordance with a reasonable private benefit plan maintained by the employer shall be exempt from all taxes and shall not be liable to attachment, garnishment, levy or seizure by or under any legal or equitable process whatsoever except to pay a debt of the official or employee concerned to the private benefit plan or that arising from liability imposed in a criminal action: Provided, That the retiring official or employee has been in the service of the same employer for at least ten (10) years and is not less than fifty years of age at the time of his retirement: Provided, further, That the benefits granted under this Act shall be availed of by an official or employee only once: Provided, finally, That in case of separation of an official or employee from the service of the employer due to death, sickness or other physical disability or for any cause beyond the control of the said official or employee, any amount received by him or by his heirs from the employer as a consequence of such separation shall likewise be exempt as hereinabove provided. (Emphasis supplied)\n\nOn the other hand, RA No. 7641 entitled, \"An Act Amending Article 287 of Presidential Decree No. 442, as Amended, Otherwise Known as the Labor Code of the Philippines, by Providing for Retirement Pay to Qualified Private Sector Employees in the Absence of Any Retirement Plan in the Establishment,\" states:\n\nSection 1. Article 287 of Presidential Decree No. 442, as amended, otherwise known as the Labor Code of the Philippines, is hereby amended to read as follows:\n\n\"Art. 287. \u2014 Any employee may be retired upon reaching the retirement age established in the collective bargaining agreement or other applicable employment contract.\n\n\"In case of retirement, the employee shall be entitled to receive such retirement benefits as he may have earned under existing laws and any collective bargaining agreement and other agreements: Provided, however, That an employee's retirement benefits under any collective bargaining and other agreements shall not be less than those provided herein.\n\n\"In the absence of a retirement plan or agreement providing for retirement benefits of employees in the establishment, an employee upon reaching the age of sixty (60) years or more, but not beyond sixty-five (65) years which is hereby declared the compulsory retirement age, who has served at least five (5) years in the said establishment, may retire and shall be entitled to retirement pay equivalent to at least one-half (1/2) month salary for every year of service, a fraction of at least six (6) months being considered as one whole year. (Emphasis supplied)\n\nFurther, please be informed that Section 32 (B) (6) (a) of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended, states that:\n\n\"Section 32. Gross Income. \u2014\n\n(B) Exclusions from Gross Income. \u2014 The following items shall not be included in gross income and shall be exempt from taxation under this Title:\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(6) Retirement Benefits, Pensions, Gratuities, etc. \u2014\n\n(a) Retirement benefits received under R.A. 7641 and those received by officials and employees of private firms, whether individual or corporate, in accordance with a reasonable private benefit plan maintained by the employer: Provided, that the retiring official or employee has been in the service of the same employer for at least ten (10) years and is not less than fifty (50) years of age at the time of his retirement: ...,shall not be included in gross income and shall be exempt from taxation.\" (Emphasis supplied)\n\nBased on the above, if the company maintains a private retirement plan which has been determined by the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) as a \"reasonable retirement benefit plan,\" the retirement benefits that will be received by the employees shall be exempt from income tax, provided that the two (2) conditions are met, viz.: (1) the employee had been in the service of the same private firm for at least ten (10) years; and (2) he is at least fifty (50) years old at the time of retirement. However, if the company does not maintain a retirement plan approved by the BIR as a \"reasonable retirement benefit plan,\" the provisions of RA No. 7641 shall apply.\n\nConsidering that Fluor Daniel Philippines, Inc.-Philippines has a reasonable retirement benefit plan with Certificate of Tax Exemption No. 049-2019 as determined by the BIR, the retirement benefits you are to receive from Fluor Daniel Philippines, Inc.-Philippines are not exempt from tax since you have failed to meet the requirement of having been employed in said company for at least ten (10) years.\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be disclosed that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and avoid. aScITE\n\nThank you and we hope we have been of assistance.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.)

HTcADC\n\nIt is represented that your client's retirement plan states that the early retirement eligibility requirement is at least fifteen (15) years of service and employee is fifty (50) years old. On the other hand, the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) Certification granted that employee must have rendered ten (10) years of service to the company; and be at least fifty (50) years of age at the time of retirement.\n\nIn reply, please be informed that Section 32 (B) (6) (a) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, provides, viz.:\n\n\"(a) Retirement benefits received under R.A. 7641 and those received by officials and employees of private firms, whether individual or corporate, in accordance with a reasonable private benefit plan maintained by the employer: Provided, that the retiring official or employee has been in the service of the same employer for at least ten (10) years and is not less than fifty (50) years of age at the time of his retirement: . . ., shall not be included in gross income and shall be exempt from taxation.\"\n\nAccordingly, retirement benefits received under Republic Act (R.A.) No. 7641 shall not be included in gross income and shall be exempt from income tax effective January 1, 1998. On the other hand, the retirement benefits to be received by private sector employees under Section 32 (B) (6) (a) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, are exempt from income tax provided that their employers maintain a qualified retirement benefit plan duly approved by the Bureau of Internal Revenue.\n\nSection 1 of R.A. No. 7641, otherwise known as an \"Act Amending Article 287 of Presidential Decree No. 442, as amended, otherwise known as the Labor Code of the Philippines, by Providing for Retirement Pay to Qualified Private Sector Employees in the Absence of any Retirement Plan in the Establishment\" provides, viz.:\n\n\"Section 1. Article 287 of Presidential Decree No. 442, as amended, otherwise known as the Labor Code of the Philippines, is hereby amended to read as follows:\n\nArt. 287. Retirement. \u2014 Any employee may be retired upon reaching the retirement age established in the collective bargaining agreement or other applicable employment contract.\n\nIn case of retirement, the employee shall be entitled to receive such retirement benefits as he may have earned under existing laws and any collective bargaining agreement and other agreements: Provided, however, that an employee's retirement under any collective bargaining and other agreements shall not be less than those provided herein.\n\nIn the absence of a retirement plan or agreement providing for retirement benefits of employees in the establishment, an employee upon reaching the age of sixty (60) years or more, but not beyond sixty-five (65) which is declared the compulsory retirement age, who has served at least five (5) years in the establishment, may retire and shall be entitled to retirement pay equivalent to at least one-half (1/2) month salary for every year of service, a fraction of at least six (6) months being considered as one (1) whole year.\"\n\nBased on the foregoing, R.A. No. 7641 will apply only in the absence of any retirement plan, collective bargaining agreement or other applicable employment contract in the establishment. Under the said Act, an employee upon reaching the age of sixty (60) years or more, but not beyond sixty-five (65) which is declared the compulsory retirement age, who has served at least five (5) years in the service of the employer, may retire and shall be entitled to retirement pay equivalent to at least one-half (1/2) month salary for every year of service, a fraction of at least six (6) months being considered as one (1) whole year.\n\nUnder Section 32 (B) (6) (a) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, the employee must have rendered ten (10) years of service to the company; and be at least fifty (50) years of age at the time of retirement, otherwise the retirement benefits to be paid to him shall be subject to income tax and consequently to withholding tax.\n\nConsidering that your client maintains a \"reasonable private benefit plan\" duly approved by the Bureau of Internal Revenue, the provisions thereof shall apply. Under your client's retirement plan, the early retirement eligibility requirement is at least fifteen (15) years of service and employee is fifty (50) years old. Applying the provisions of the aforesaid plan, an employee who is not at least fifty (50) years of age and has rendered less than fifteen (15) years of service is not qualified for early retirement hence, the benefits to be received by the said employee, if any, shall be subject to income tax and consequently to the withholding tax.\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented.

No. 8525, otherwise known as the \"Adopt-A-School Act of 1998.\"\n\nIt is represented that FGP Corp., with Tax Identification Number (TIN) _____________ is a domestic corporation duly registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under SEC Registration No. ____________; that on July 31, 2015, FGP Corp. entered into Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with the DepEd, in which the former proposed to DepEd to construct thirteen (13) classrooms with accessories, for the benefit of school children affected by Yolanda; that pursuant to said MOA, FGP Corp., through its ____________ BBB, executed on December 17, 2015, a Deed of Donation in favor of DepEd whereby the former donated to the latter a total amount of ______________ for School Rebuilding Project; that Br. Armin A. Luistro FSC, Secretary of the DepEd, Chairperson, Coordinating Council, indorsed the application for tax incentives of FGP CORP. relative to the above donation, 100% of which amounts to ___________ plus an additional 50% thereof amounting to _____________ for a total amount of ___________ and that per Certification dated January 27, 2015 issued by the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA), the Adopt-A-School Program is considered a Priority Project in the National Priority Plan of the Government for the year 2015.\n\nIn reply, please be informed that under Section 34 (H) (2) (a) of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended, donations to the Government, its agencies or political subdivisions are deductible in full from the gross income of the donor. However, donations not in accordance with the National Priority Plan are subject to limited deductibility or deductions to an amount not exceeding 10% in the case of an individual and 5% in the case of a corporation of the taxpayer's taxable net income as computed without the benefit of this deduction.\n\nMoreover, Section 5 of RA No. 8525 provides for an additional deduction from the gross income of the adopting entity equivalent to fifty percent (50%) of the expenses incurred for the project, to wit:\n\n\"SECTION 5. Additional Deduction for Expenses Incurred for the Adoption. \u2014 Provisions of existing laws to the contrary notwithstanding, expenses incurred by the adopting entity for the 'Adopt-a-School Program' shall be allowed an additional deduction from the gross income equivalent to fifty percent (50%) of such expenses.\n\nValuation of assistance other than money shall be based on the acquisition cost of the property. . .\"\n\nThe above provision is implemented by Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 10-2003 which provides for the guidelines in the availment of the additional deduction for the expenses incurred by the adopting entity:\n\n\"SECTION 3. Tax Incentives Accruing to the Adopting Private Entity. \u2014 A pre-qualified adopting private entity, which enters into an Agreement with a public school, shall be entitled to the following tax incentives:\n\n(a) Deduction from the gross income of the amount of contribution/donation that were actually, directly and exclusively incurred for the Program, subject to limitations, conditions and rules set forth in Section 34(H) of the Tax Code, plus an additional amount equivalent to fifty percent (50%) of such contribution/donation subject to the following conditions:\n\n(1) That the deduction shall be availed of in the taxable year in which the expenses have been paid or incurred;\n\n(2) That the taxpayer can substantiate the deduction with sufficient evidence, such as official receipts or delivery receipt and other adequate records \u2014\n\n(2.1) The amount of expenses being claimed as deduction;\n\n(2.2) The direct connection or relation of the expenses to the adopting private entity's participation in the Adopt-a-School Program. The adopting private entity shall also provide a list of projects and/or activities undertaken and the cost of each undertaking, indicating in particular where and how the assistance has been utilized as supported by the Agreement; and\n\n(2.3) Proof or acknowledgment of receipt of the contributed/donated property by the recipient public school.\n\n(3) That the application, together with the approved Agreement endorsed by the National Secretariat, shall be filed with the Revenue District Office (RDO) having jurisdiction over the place of business of the donor/adopting private entity, copy furnished the RDO having jurisdiction over the property, if the contribution/donation is in the form of real property.\"\n\nIn view of the foregoing, since FGP CORP. is compliant with the requirements set forth under Section 3 of RR 10-2003, the amount it actually, directly, and exclusively incurred for the construction of thirteen (13) classrooms with accessories of the Department of Education amounting to ______________ is fully deductible from its gross income, plus an additional deduction equivalent to fifty percent (50%) thereof in the amount of ____________ or a total deductible amount of ____________. (BIR Ruling No. 292-2016 dated June 27, 2016)\n\nLastly, Section 101 (A) (1) [1] of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended, provides that:\n\n\"SECTION 101. Exemption of Certain Gifts. \u2014 The following gifts or donations shall be exempt from the tax provided for in this Chapter:\n\n(A) In the Case of Gifts Made by a Resident. \u2014\n\n(1) Gifts made to or for the use of the National Government or any entity created by any of its agencies which is not conducted for profit, or to any political subdivision of the said Government.\"\n\nThus, pursuant to the above quoted provision, the donation made by FGP CORP. to DepEd is also exempt from the payment of donor's tax. (BIR Ruling No. 292-2016 dated June 27, 2016).\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be disclosed that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R. DULAY\nCommissioner of Internal Revenue\n\n1. Renumbered by Republic Act No. 10963 or the TRAIN Law.",

It is engaged in the manufacture for subsequent exportation of coating materials for automotive safety airbag fabrics; and is a registered Philippine Economic Zone Authority (PEZA) entity engaged in export and warehousing/logistics activities.\n\nIn reply, please be informed that the PEZA Certification dated January 3, 2017 issued to STT, provides:\n\n\"This is to further certify that STT is a qualified enterprise for the purpose of VAT zero-rating of its transactions with its local suppliers of goods, properties and services in connection with its PEZA-registered activities, in accordance with Sections 4.106-6 and 4.108-6 of Revenue Regulations No. 16-2005, the Consolidated Value-Added Tax Regulations 2005.\" (Emphasis supplied)\n\nRelative thereto, Sections 4.106-6 and 4.108-6 of Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 16-2005 state: EcTCAD\n\n\"SECTION 4.106-6.  Meaning of the Term \"Effectively Zero-rated Sale of Goods and Properties.\" \u2014 The term \"effectively zero-rated sale of goods and properties\" shall refer to the local sale of goods and properties by a VAT-registered person to a person or entity who was granted indirect tax exemption under special laws or international agreement.

De Leon St.\nPoblacion, Sta. Maria\nBulacan, Philippines\n\nAttention: AAA\n_______________\n\nGentlemen :\n\nThis refers to your letter dated September 15, 2019, applying on behalf of JPI TECHNOLOGIES TRAINING AND SERVICES, INC. for the issuance of a certificate of tax exemption enjoyed by a non-stock corporation or association organized and operated exclusively for educational purposes under Section 30 (H) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended.\n\nIt is represented that JPI TECHNOLOGIES TRAINING AND SERVICES, INC., with BIR Taxpayer's Identification No. (TIN) 000-000-000-000, is a non-stock, non-profit association duly organized and existing under the laws of the Republic of the Philippines; and that it is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under Company Registration No. CN200708854. HTcADC\n\nIn reply, please be informed that paragraph 3, Section 4, Article XIV of the 1987 Constitution states that:\n\n\"All revenues and assets of non-stock, non-profit educational institutions used actually, directly, and exclusively for educational purposes shall be exempt from taxes and duties.\"\n\nSimilarly, Section 30 (H) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, provides, viz.:\n\n\"Sec. 30. Exemptions from Tax on Corporations. \u2014 The following organizations shall not be taxed under this Title in respect to income received by them as such:\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(H) A non-stock and non-profit educational institution; x x x.\"\n\nMoreover, there are two requisites in order for a non-stock, non-profit educational institution to be exempt from tax as provided under Revenue Memorandum Order (RMO) No. 44-2016; to wit:\n\na) It is a non-stock, non-profit educational institution; and\n\nb) Its revenues are actually, directly and exclusively used for educational purposes.\n\n\"Non-stock\" means \"no part of its income is distributable as dividends to its members, trustees, or officers\" and that any profit \"obtained as an incident to its operations shall, whenever necessary or proper, be used for the furtherance of the purpose or purposes for which the corporation was organized.\" [1] \"Non-profit\" means that \"no net income or asset accrues to or benefits any member or specific person, with all the net income or assets devoted to the institution's purposes and all its activities conducted not for profit.\" [2]\n\nIn the submitted documents of JPI TECHNOLOGIES TRAINING AND SERVICES, INC., it was disclosed that the Board of Trustees are entitled to reasonable per diems. The Treasurer's Affidavit/Certification shows that the Trustees may receive reasonable per diems. The giving of per diems to the members of the Board of Trustees is considered as distribution of equity (including the net income) of JPI TECHNOLOGIES TRAINING AND SERVICES, INC. This is a form of private inurement which the law prohibits in the organization and operation of a non-stock, non-profit corporation. This act violates the requirement that no part of the net income or assets of the corporation shall inure to the benefit of any individual or specific person. Thus, JPI TECHNOLOGIES TRAINING AND SERVICES, INC. cannot be qualified as a non-stock, non-profit educational institution under Section 30 (H) of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended. CAIHTE\n\nPlease bear in mind that, \"being a non-stock and/or non-profit corporation does not, by this reason alone, completely exempt an institution from tax.\" [3] Thus, \"statutes granting tax exemptions are construed strictissimi juris against the taxpayer and liberally in favor of the taxing authority. A claim of tax exemption must be clearly shown and based on language in law too plain to be mistaken. Otherwise stated, taxation is the rule, exemption is the exception. The burden of proof rests upon the party claiming the exemption to prove that it is in fact covered by the exemption so claimed.\" [4] (BIR Ruling No. 466-2014 dated November 19, 2014)\n\nIn view of the foregoing, the request of JPI TECHNOLOGIES TRAINING AND SERVICES, INC. to be exempted from income tax on its income as a Section 30 (H) institution is hereby denied as it failed to prove that it is a non-profit corporation. Therefore, JPI TECHNOLOGIES TRAINING AND SERVICES, INC. shall be treated as a regular corporation subject to thirty percent (30%) regular tax rate pursuant to Section 27 (A) of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended. aScITE\n\nPlease be guided accordingly.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.)

EVR Sapang Palay,\nCity of San Jose Del Monte\nBulacan, Philippines\n\nAttention: AAA\n_______________\n\nGentlemen :\n\nThis refers to your letter dated September 15, 2019, applying on behalf of JAPAN PHILIPPINES INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY-CITY OF SAN JOSE DEL MONTE CAMPUS, INC. for the issuance of a certificate of tax exemption enjoyed by a non-stock corporation or association organized and operated exclusively for educational purposes under Section 30 (H) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended.\n\nIt is represented that JAPAN PHILIPPINES INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY-CITY OF SAN JOSE DEL MONTE CAMPUS, INC., with BIR Taxpayer's Identification No. (TIN) 000-000-000-000, is a non-stock, non-profit association duly organized and existing under the laws of the Republic of the Philippines; and that it is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under Company Registration No. CN201808611. HTcADC\n\nIn reply, please be informed that paragraph 3, Section 4, Article XIV of the 1987 Constitution states that:\n\n\"All revenues and assets of non-stock, non-profit educational institutions used actually, directly, and exclusively for educational purposes shall be exempt from taxes and duties.\"\n\nSimilarly, Section 30 (H) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, provides, viz.:\n\n\"Sec. 30. Exemptions from Tax on Corporations. \u2014 The following organizations shall not be taxed under this Title in respect to income received by them as such:\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(H) A non-stock and non-profit educational institution; x x x.\"\n\nMoreover, there are two requisites in order for a non-stock, non-profit educational institution to be exempt from tax as provided under Revenue Memorandum Order (RMO) No. 44-2016; to wit:\n\na) It is a non-stock, non-profit educational institution; and\n\nb) Its revenues are actually, directly and exclusively used for educational purposes.\n\n\"Non-stock\" means \"no part of its income is distributable as dividends to its members, trustees, or officers\" and that any profit \"obtained as an incident to its operations shall, whenever necessary or proper, be used for the furtherance of the purpose or purposes for which the corporation was organized.\" [1] \"Non-profit\" means that \"no net income or asset accrues to or benefits any member or specific person, with all the net income or assets devoted to the institution's purposes and all its activities conducted not for profit.\" [2]\n\nIn the submitted documents of JAPAN PHILIPPINES INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY-CITY OF SAN JOSE DEL MONTE CAMPUS, INC., it was disclosed that the Board of Trustees are entitled to reasonable per diems. The Treasurer's Affidavit/Certification shows that the Trustees are entitled to receive reasonable per diems. The giving of per diems to the members of the Board of Trustees is considered as distribution of equity (including the net income) of JAPAN PHILIPPINES INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY-CITY OF SAN JOSE DEL MONTE CAMPUS, INC. This is a form of private inurement which the law prohibits in the organization and operation of a non-stock, non-profit corporation. This act violates the requirement that no part of the net income or assets of the corporation shall inure to the benefit of any individual or specific person. Thus, JAPAN PHILIPPINES INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY-CITY OF SAN JOSE DEL MONTE CAMPUS, INC. cannot be qualified as a non-stock, non-profit educational institution under Section 30 (H) of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended. CAIHTE\n\nPlease bear in mind that, \"being a non-stock and/or non-profit corporation does not, by this reason alone, completely exempt an institution from tax.\" [3] Thus, \"statutes granting tax exemptions are construed strictissimi juris against the taxpayer and liberally in favor of the taxing authority. A claim of tax exemption must be clearly shown and based on language in law too plain to be mistaken. Otherwise stated, taxation is the rule, exemption is the exception. The burden of proof rests upon the party claiming the exemption to prove that it is in fact covered by the exemption so claimed.\" [4] (BIR Ruling No. 466-2014 dated November 19, 2014)\n\nIn view of the foregoing, the request of JAPAN PHILIPPINES INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY-CITY OF SAN JOSE DEL MONTE CAMPUS, INC., to be exempted from income tax on its income as a Section 30 (H) institution is hereby denied as it failed to prove that it is a non-profit corporation. Therefore, JAPAN PHILIPPINES INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY-CITY OF SAN JOSE DEL MONTE CAMPUS, INC. shall be treated as a regular corporation subject to thirty percent (30%) regular tax rate pursuant to Section 27 (A) of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended. aScITE\n\nPlease be guided accordingly.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.)

Garcia\nPresident\n\nGentlemen :\n\nThis refers to your letter dated April 29, 2019, applying on behalf of OUR LADY OF PILAR MONTESSORI CENTER, INC. for tax exemption certificate being enjoyed by non-stock, non-profit corporation or association under Section 30 (H) of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) of 1997, as amended.\n\nIt is represented that OUR LADY OF PILAR MONTESSORI CENTER, INC. with BIR Taxpayer's Identification No. (TIN) ___________ is a non-stock, non-profit association duly organized and existing under the laws of the Republic of the Philippines; that it is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under Company Registration No. __________; and that the purpose for which the association was incorporated is to \"establish, maintain, operate and conduct a co-educational institution or learning in arts and sciences in the pre-school and elementary levels.\"\n\nIn reply, please be informed that paragraph 3, Section 4, Article XIV of the 1987 Constitution states that:\n\n\"All revenues and assets of non-stock, non-profit educational institutions used actually, directly, and exclusively for educational purposes shall be exempt from taxes and duties.\" (Emphasis supplied)\n\nLikewise, Section 30 (H) of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended, provides, viz.:\n\n\"Sec. 30. Exemptions from Tax on Corporations. \u2014 The following organizations shall not be taxed under this Title in respect to income received by them as such:\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(H) A non-stock and non-profit educational institution; x x x\" (Emphasis supplied)\n\nMoreover, there are two requisites in order for an educational institution to be exempt from tax as provided under Revenue Memorandum Order (RMO) No. 44-2016 dated July 25, 2016; to wit: SaCIDT\n\na) It is a non-stock, non-profit educational institution; and\n\nb) Its revenues are actually, directly and exclusively used for educational purposes. (Emphasis supplied)\n\nUnder the above quoted provisions, one of the requirements for an educational institution to be exempt from income tax pursuant to the provisions of paragraph 3, Section 4, Article XIV of the 1987 Constitution, in relation to Section 30 (H) of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended, and RMO No. 44-2016, is to be organized as a non-stock, non-profit educational institution. However, in the instant case, the submitted Articles of Incorporation of OUR LADY OF PILAR MONTESSORI CENTER, INC. disclosed that its registration with the SEC is only as a non-stock corporation. Consequently, it cannot be qualified as a non-profit educational institution under Section 30 (H) of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended. Therefore, it shall be treated as an ordinary corporation subject to thirty percent (30%) income tax rate pursuant to Section 27 (A) and other internal revenue taxes imposed by the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended.\n\nPlease bear in mind that, \"statutes granting tax exemptions are construed strictissimi juris against the taxpayer and liberally in favor of the taxing authority. A claim of tax exemption must be clearly shown and based on language in law too plain to be mistaken. Otherwise stated, taxation is the rule, exemption is the exception. The burden of proof rests upon the party claiming the exemption to prove that it is in fact covered by the exemption so claimed.\" [1]\n\nPlease be guided accordingly.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.)

Alcantara & Sons, Inc. (\"CASI,\" for brevity), for confirmation of your opinion on the tax consequences of CASI's dissolution as to distribution of real and personal properties as liquidating dividends to its remaining shareholders, Alsons Consolidated Resources, Inc. (\"ACR\") and Alsons Development & Investment Corp. (\"Aldevinco\").\n\nIt is represented that CASI is a domestic corporation primarily engaged in the manufacture and sale of plywood. On August 15, 2013, its Board of Directors resolved to shorten the corporate life of the company until March 30, 2014. Pursuant to its dissolution, the company intends to transfer its remaining assets, consisting of land and biological assets, to its remaining shareholders as liquidating dividends.\n\nIt is further represented that as of date, the remaining shareholders of the company are ACR and Aldevinco.\n\nIn connection therewith, you are now requesting for confirmation of your opinion that:\n\n1. The shareholders of CASI will be subject to income tax on its net gains, if any, from the receipt of the liquidating dividends.\n\n2. CASI shall not be liable for income tax or capital gains tax either on its receipt of surrendered shares or its transfer of remaining assets to its shareholders as liquidating dividends;\n\n3. The transfer of the remaining assets of CASI to its shareholders, as liquidating dividends, shall not be subject to value-added tax (VAT);\n\n4. The transfer of the real property as liquidating dividends to the shareholders shall not be subject to documentary stamp tax (DST); and\n\n5. The surrender and cancellation of the outstanding shares shall not be subject to DST.\n\nWe reply, as follows:\n\n(1) Pursuant to Section 8 of Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 6-2008 dated April 22, 2008, corporate shareholders shall recognize capital gains upon surrender of shares computed as excess of the cash and fair market value of property received over the cost of the investment in shares and that such gain shall be subject to the 30% corporate income tax rate, to wit;\n\n\"SECTION 8. Taxation of Surrender of Shares by the Investor Upon Dissolution of the Corporation and Liquidating of Assets and Liabilities of said Corporation. \u2014 Upon surrender by the investor of the shares in exchange for cash and property distributed by the issuing corporation upon its dissolution and liquidation of all assets and liabilities, the investor shall recognize either capital gain or capital loss upon such surrender of shares computed by comparing the cash and fair market value of property received against the cost of the investment in shares. The difference between the sum of the cash and the fair market value of property received and the cost of the investment in shares shall represent the capital gain or capital loss from the investment, whichever is applicable. If the investor is an individual, the rule on holding period shall apply and the percentage of taxable capital gain or deductible capital loss shall depend on the number of months or years the shares are held by the investor. Section 39 of the Tax Code, as amended, shall herein apply in all possible situations.\n\nThe capital gain or loss derived therefrom shall be subject to the regular income tax rates imposed under the Tax Code, as amended, on individual taxpayers or to the corporate income tax rate, in case of corporations.\"\n\nBased on the above provision of RR No. 6-2008, if the fair market value of the assets received by ACR and Aldevinco exceeds their respective cost of investment in shares, they shall recognize a gain subject to the 30% corporate income tax. Conversely, if the fair market value of the assets received as liquidating dividends does not exceed the cost of their investment, no taxable gain will be recognized by ACR and Aldevinco. [Section 256, RR No. 2, Income Tax Regulations] (BIR Ruling No. 028-2002 dated July 22, 2002)\n\n(2) No tax shall be imposed on the liquidating corporation's receipt of the shares surrendered by the shareholders because the transaction is not treated as a sale.\n\nIn BIR Ruling No. 092-99 dated July 8, 1999 this Office ruled, viz.:\n\n\"The transfer by the liquidating corporation of its remaining assets to its stockholders is not considered as a sale of these assets. Thus, a liquidating corporation does not realize gain or loss in partial or complete liquidation. [W.P. Fax & Sons, Inc., Petitioner v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, Respondent, 15 BTA 115; Jordan Petroleum Company, 13 AFTR 2d 1692 (227 F. Supp. 174); J.T.S Brown & Son Company v. Commissioner of the Internal Revenue, 10 TC 840] Hence, the transfer by Fundamental Development Corporation of its assets, i.e., one (1) parcel of land, to its controlling stockholders by way of liquidating dividends is not subject to the expanded creditable withholding tax imposed under Revenue Regulations No. 6-85, as amended by Revenue Regulations No. 12-94, as last amended by Revenue Regulations No. 2-98 (BIR Ruling No. 059-90 dated April 17, 1990), and consequently, the same is not subject to the corporate income tax.\"\n\nFurthermore, in Victoria Fernando vs. Sps. Lim (G.R. No. 176282, August 22, 2008), the Supreme Court held that no tax shall be imposed on the liquidating corporation's receipt of the shares surrendered by the shareholders because the transaction is not treated as a sale. In the said case, the Court had the opportunity to discuss the nature of a liquidating dividend and its tax consequence, to wit:\n\n\"The share of each stockholder in the remaining assets of the corporation upon liquidation, after the payment of all corporate debts and liabilities, is what is known as liquidating dividend. In its interpretation of recent tax laws, the Bureau of Internal Revenue viewed the distribution of liquidating dividends not as sale of asset by the liquidating corporation to its stockholder but as a sale of shares by the stockholder to the corporation or the surrender of the stockholder's interest in the corporation, in place of which said stockholder receives property or money from the corporation about to be dissolved. Thus, on the part of the stockholder, any gain or loss is subject to tax, while on the part of the liquidating corporation, no tax is imposed on its receipt of the shares surrendered by the stockholder or transfer of assets to said stockholder because said transaction is not treated as a sale.\" (Citations omitted and emphasis supplied.)\n\nConsidering the foregoing, CASI shall not be liable for any income tax from the distribution of liquidating dividends nor from the receipt of surrendered shares. Consequently, the transfer of assets by CASI, such as land and biological assets, to its shareholders by way of liquidating dividends is not subject to creditable withholding tax (BIR Ruling Nos. 092-99 dated July 8, 1999 citing BIR Ruling No. 059-90 dated April 17, 1990; and 028-2002 dated July 22, 2002).\n\n(3) The retirement from or cessation of business, with respect to inventories of taxable goods existing as of such retirement and cessation shall be \"deemed sale\" pursuant to Section 106 (B) (4) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended and implemented by Section 4.106-7 of RR No. 16-2005.\n\nConsequently, the distribution of remaining assets, such as land and biological assets, by CASI to its shareholders as of such retirement or cessation of business shall be subject to 12% VAT. (BIR Ruling No. 363-14 dated September 22, 2014)\n\n(4) The DST imposed under Section 196 of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, shall not apply in transfers of real property as liquidating dividends to its remaining stockholders. Section 196 of the Tax Code, as amended, provides:\n\n\"SEC. 196. Stamp Tax on Deeds of Sale and Conveyances of Real Property. \u2014 On all conveyances, deeds, instruments, or writings, other than grants, patents, or original certificates of adjudication issued by the Government, whereby any lands, tenements or other realty sold shall be granted, assigned, transferred, or otherwise conveyed to the purchaser, or purchasers, or to any other person or persons designated by such purchaser or purchasers, there shall be collected a documentary stamp tax at the following rates:\n\n\"(a) When the consideration, or value received or contracted to be paid for such realty, after making proper allowance of any encumbrance, does not exceed one thousand pesos (P1,000), Fifteen pesos (P15.00).\"\n\n\"(b) For each additional One thousand pesos (P1,000), or fractional part thereof in excess of One thousand pesos (P1,000) of such consideration or value, Fifteen pesos (P15.00).\"\n\nHowever, the above provision does not apply to transfers of property as return of capital. RR No. 26 further provides that conveyance of real property by a corporation without consideration to the owner of its capital stock is not subject to DST. Section 189 of RR No. 26 provides:\n\n\"Section 189. Conveyance by corporation to owner of all the capital. \u2014 A conveyance of real estate by a corporation without valuable consideration to an owner of all its capital stock in consequence of its dissolution is not subject to tax.\"\n\nIn BIR Ruling No. 028-2002 dated July 22, 2002, this Office ruled that:\n\n\"Since the stockholders of Rose Packaging Company, Inc. will receive upon its liquidation its assets consisting of the aforementioned land as liquidating dividends, they will thereby realize capital gain or loss. The gain, if any, derived by the individual stockholders consisting of the difference between the fair market value of the liquidating dividends and the adjusted cost to the stockholders of their respective shareholdings in the said corporation [Sec. 256, Income Tax Regulations] shall be subject to income tax at the rates prescribed under then Section 21(a) of the Tax Code, as amended by Executive Order No. 37. Moreover, pursuant to then Section 33(B) of the Tax Code, as amended, only 50% of the aforementioned capital gain is reportable for income tax purposes if the shares were held by the individual stockholders for more than twelve months and 100% of the capital gains if the shares were held less than twelve months. Finally, this Office has ruled that the conveyance of real property in the form of liquidating dividends to the stockholders is not subject to documentary stamp tax under Section 196 of the Tax Code.\" (Underscoring ours.)\n\nConsidering the foregoing, Section 196 of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, shall not apply to the distribution of assets as liquidating dividends. Therefore, the distribution of the remaining assets of CASI to its shareholders shall not be subject to DST.\n\nIt is, however, understood that an application for Certificate Authorizing Registration (CAR) shall be made to the Revenue District Office (RDO) where CASI is registered or previously registered, if registration has been cancelled. Once issued, it shall be presented to the proper Register of Deeds. This ruling exempting the transaction from payment of DST shall also be presented to the said RDO before any transfer of title could be made to the parties concerned.\n\n(5) Under Section 175 of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, DST shall be imposed on the sale or transfer of shares of stock, to wit:\n\n\"SEC. 175. Stamp Tax on Sales, Agreements to Sell. Memoranda of Sales, Deliveries or Transfer of Shares or Certificates of Stock. \u2014 On all sales, or agreements to sell, or memoranda of sales, or deliveries, or transfer of shares or certificates of stocks in any association, company, or corporation, or transfer of such securities by assignment in blank, or by delivery, or by any paper or agreement, or memorandum or other evidences of transfer or sale whether entitling the holder in any manner to the benefit of such stock, or to secure the future payment of money, or for the future transfer of any stock, there shall be collected a documentary stamp tax of Seventy-five centavos (P0.75) on each Two hundred pesos (P200), or fractional part thereof, of the par value of such stock: Provided, that only one tax shall be collected on each sale or transfer of stock from one person to another, regardless of whether or not a certificate of stock is issued, indorsed, or delivered in pursuance of such sale or transfer: and Provided, further, that in the case of stock without par value the amount of the documentary stamp tax herein prescribed shall be equivalent to twenty-five percent (25%) of the documentary stamp tax paid upon the original issue of said stock.\"\n\nHowever, Section 175 of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, is not applicable for shares surrendered upon dissolution of a corporation. Section 4 of RR No. 13-2004 provides that for an exchange to be subject to DST, there must be an actual or constructive transfer of the beneficial ownership of the shares of stock, to wit:\n\n\"All transfer of shares of stocks of a domestic corporation [is] subject to the DST upon execution of the deed transferring ownership or rights thereto, or upon delivery, assignment or indorsement of such shares in favor of another. No transfer of shares of stock shall be recorded unless DST thereon has been duly paid for in accordance with Section 201 of the Code.\n\n\"For a sale or exchange to be taxable, there must be an actual or constructive transfer of beneficial ownership of the shares of stock from one person to another. Such transfer may be manifested by the clear exercise of attributes of ownership over such stocks by the transferee, or by an actual entry indicating transfer of beneficial ownership in any form of registry including those of a duly authorized scripless registry, such as those maintained for or by the Philippine Stock Exchange.\"\n\nFurther, it was previously held that the surrender of shares does not constitute a sale, assignment or transfer because the dissolved corporation is not taking title to the shares, and the shares are retired and not retained as treasury shares. In effect, the dissolved corporation does not realize any benefit from its receipt of the shares (BIR Ruling No. 039-2002 dated November 11, 2002).\n\nBased on the foregoing, the surrender of shares resulting from the dissolution and liquidating of a corporation is not an actual transfer of the beneficial ownership of the shares. The dissolved corporation merely receives the shares for cancellation and does not exercise any attribute of ownership over the shares of stock. Thus, the surrender of the shares by shareholders to CASI as a result of its dissolution should not be subject to DST.\n\nFinally, cancellation of business registration due to closure/cessation or termination of business requires the filing of a notice of closure or cessation of business to the RDO where it is registered, by accomplishing the prescribed registration updates form and submission of unused sales invoices/official receipts (SI/OR) and all other unutilized accounting forms. Likewise, all business notices and permits and the Certificate of Registration shall be surrendered for cancellation in accordance with Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 11-2008.\n\nThis ruling is issued based on the facts as represented. However, if upon investigation it shall be disclosed that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be without force and effect insofar as the herein parties are concerned.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.)

Garrido (Ret)\nPresident\n\nGentlemen :\n\nThis refer to your letter dated February 3, 2014 requesting for a confirmatory ruling that the AFP OFFICERS VILLAGE ASSOCIATION, INC. is entitled to tax exemption as a non-stock, non-profit corporation under Section 30 of the 1997 Tax Code, as amended.\n\nIt is represented that AFP OFFICERS VILLAGE ASSOCIATION, INC., with Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) _______________ is a non-stock and non-profit residential homeowner association duly organized under Section 2 (a) of Executive Order No. 535 and Section 26 of Republic Act No. 8763; that it is registered with the Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board (HLURB) and that among the purposes for which it is formed are:\n\n1. To foster a strong, effective and cohesive group of AFP officers who have acquired or have applied to acquire and been allocated residential lots at the AFP Officers Village in Taguig, Metro Manila, covered under Presidential Proclamation No. 461 dated September 29, 1965;\n\n2. To coordinate with appropriate government offices and agencies for the survey and subdivision of the area covered by the above cited PP 461, and for the speedy conduct of bidding, issuances of order award, and titling of lots therein in favor of Officer-members of the Association;\n\n3. To work for an integrated land development of the area covered by the aforecited PP 461 into an exclusive residential subdivision with concrete roads, curbs and gutter, underground drainage, and water, electric and telephone facilities;\n\n4. To secure the AFP Officers Village from squatters and other parties that may infringe on, or otherwise adversely affect, the rights of its members; and\n\n5. To promote the welfare and protect the interests of its members.\n\nIn reply thereto, please be informed that AFP OFFICERS VILLAGE ASSOCIATION, INC. which is a residential homeowner association is not among those non-stock, non-profit corporations contemplated under Section 30 of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended. (BIR Ruling No. 402-13 dated November 7, 2013) ISHCcT\n\nHence, AFP OFFICERS VILLAGE ASSOCIATION, INC. may not avail of the income tax exemption under Section 30 of the 1997 Tax Code, as amended. Please note, however, that Revenue Memorandum Circular (RMC) No. 9-2013 discussed the taxability of association dues, membership fees, and other assessments/charges collected by a homeowners' association from its homeowner-members and other entities, herein quoted as follows:\n\nI. Income Tax \u2014 Section 18 of R.A. No. 9904 which exempts from taxation the association dues and income derived from rental subject to certain conditions is an implied recognition by Congress that such receipts are subject to tax under existing laws. Thus, the amounts paid in as dues or fees by homeowner-members of a homeowners' association form part of the gross income of the latter subject to income tax. This is because a homeowners' association furnishes its members with benefits, advantages and privileges in return to such payments. For tax purposes, the association dues, membership fees, and other assessment/charges collected by a homeowners' association constitute income payments or compensation for beneficial services it provides to its member and tenants. The previous interpretation that the assessment dues are funds which are merely held in trust by a homeowners' association lacks legal basis and is hereby abandoned.\n\nMoreover, since a homeowner's association is subject to income tax, income payment made to it are subject to applicable withholding taxes under existing regulation.\n\nII. Value-Added Tax (VAT) and Percentage Tax \u2014 Association dues, membership fees, and other assessment/charges collected in purely reimbursement basis by a homeowners' association are not subject to VAT [1] or percentage tax. However, gross receipts from the operation not derived from rental of its facilities, association dues, membership fees, other assessment and charges collected in purely reimbursement basis shall be subject to the 12% VAT imposed under Section 108 of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, or three percent (3%) tax imposed under Section 116 in relation to Section 109(BB) of the same Code if the gross sales or receipts from such sale of goods and services do not exceed Three Million Pesos (P3,000,000.00). [2]\n\nRMC No. 9-2013 likewise provides that the association dues and income derived by AFP OFFICERS VILLAGE ASSOCIATION, INC. from rentals of its properties may be exempted from income tax provided that the following conditions are complied with pursuant to Section 18 of RA No. 9904:\n\na. The homeowners' association must be a duly constituted \"Association\" as defined under Section 3 (b) of RA No. 9904;\n\nb. The local government unit having jurisdiction over the homeowners' association must issue certification identifying the basic services being rendered by the homeowners' association and therein stating its lack of resources to render such services notwithstanding its clear mandate under applicable laws, rules and regulations. Provided further, that such services must fall within the purview of the \"basic community services and facilities\" which is defined under Section 3 (d) of RA No. 9904 as those referring to service and facilities that redound to the benefit of all homeowners' and from which, by reason of practicality, no homeowner may be excluded such as, but not limited to: security; street and vicinity lights' maintenance, repairs and cleaning of streets; garbage collection and disposal; and other similar services and facilities; and\n\nc. The homeowners' association must present proof (i.e., financial statements) that the income and dues are used for the cleanliness, safety, security, and other basic services needed by the members, including the maintenance of the facilities of their respective subdivisions or villages.\n\nIn this case, there was no showing that the AFP OFFICERS VILLAGE ASSOCIATION, INC. met the above conditions for the entitlement of tax exemption under Section 30 of the 1997 Tax Code, as amended. In view of the foregoing, your request for the issuance of a Certificate of Tax Exemption pursuant to the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, is hereby denied. CAacTH\n\nPlease be guided accordingly.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R. DULAY\nCommissioner of Internal Revenue\n\n1.

Mayamot, Antipolo City\n\nAttention: Atty. Julio Regino I. Desamito, Jr.\nPresident\n\nGentlemen :\n\nThis refers to your letter dated November 10, 2014, requesting for a ruling confirming the exemption from income tax and value-added tax/percentage tax of VERMONT PARK RESIDENTS ASSOCIATION, INC. pursuant to Republic Act No. 9904 otherwise known as the \"Magna Carta for Homeowners and Homeowners' Associations,\" as enunciated in Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 9-2013 which clarifies the taxability of association dues, membership fees, and other assessments/charges collected by Homeowners' Associations.\n\nDocuments submitted disclosed that VERMONT PARK RESIDENTS ASSOCIATION, INC. with Taxpayers Identification No. _____________, is a non-stock and non-profit residential homeowners' association, and duly registered with the Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board (HLURB) under Certificate of Registration No. 20007; that it is situated and within the jurisdiction of Antipolo City; and that among the purposes for which the Association was incorporated are the following:\n\n1. To initiate and promote a healthy and harmonious neighborhood by developing the civic, spiritual, social and cultural awareness and consciousness of its members;\n\n2. To conduct and sponsor seminars, symposia and technical training to be conducted by expert trainers and resource speakers;\n\n3. To promote and maintain peace and order as well as cleanliness in the community in coordination with the proper government agencies;\n\n4. To act as intermediary with the different government agencies tasked with the delivery of basic necessities and services to the community;\n\n5. To seek the assistance and guidance of government and private institutions necessary to achieve the full realization of the association's objectives;\n\n6. To organize and undertake workshop for livelihood projects and other socio-economic activities, for the benefits of its members; and\n\n7. To do and perform all other acts and deeds as may be necessary, convenient and appropriate for the accomplishment of the foregoing purposes.\n\nand that the letter of Ms. Rowena T. Zapanta from the City Planning and Development Office of Antipolo City, dated June 08, 2018, states that:\n\n\"The City Legal Office has rendered again its legal opinion stating that the City Government, cannot just issue such certification [1] required by the BIR, for the sole purpose of facilitating the HOA's income tax exemption. Further, the reason why the City Government currently not rendering the basic services under Section 3(d) of RA 9904, is due to the fact that the subdivision road lots and open spaces are still not donated to the City Government, hence, the same remains a private property.\" cSaATC\n\nVERMONT PARK RESIDENTS ASSOCIATION, INC. bases its claim for tax exemption on Section 18 of R.A. No. 9904, which provides:\n\n\"SECTION 18. Relationship with LGUs. \u2014 Homeowners' associations shall complement, support and strengthen LGUs in providing vital services to their members and help implement local government policies, programs, ordinances, and rules.\n\nAssociations are encouraged to actively cooperate with LGUs in furtherance of their common goals and activities for the benefit of the residents of the subdivisions/villages and their environments.\n\nWhere the LGUs lack resources to provide for basic services, the associations shall endeavor to tap the means to provide for the same. In recognition of the associations' efforts to assist the LGUs in providing such basic services, association dues and income derived from rentals of their facilities shall be tax-exempt: Provided, That such income and dues shall be used for the cleanliness, safety, security and other basic services needed by the members, including the maintenance of the facilities of their respective subdivisions or villages. x x x\"\n\nIn reply thereto, we regret to inform you that VERMONT PARK RESIDENTS ASSOCIATION, INC. does not fall within the purview of those homeowners' associations which may be exempted for income tax under Section 18 of RA No. 9904 considering that the requisite qualification that the city or municipality concerned must be lacking in resources to provide for basic services is absent from the certification issued by the City Planning and Development Office of City of Antipolo. (BIR Ruling No. 399-2013 dated November 7, 2013)\n\nConsequently, VERMONT PARK RESIDENTS ASSOCIATION, INC., shall be subject to the applicable internal revenue taxes on its income from association dues, rentals of their facilities, trade business and other activities. Specifically:\n\nIncome Tax\n\nIt shall be subject to the corresponding internal revenue taxes imposed under the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended, on its income derived from association dues and rentals of its facilities, which income should be returned for taxation. Likewise, interest income from currency bank deposits and yield or any other monetary benefit from deposit substitute instruments and from trust funds and similar arrangements, and royalties derived from sources within the Philippines are subject to the 20% final withholding tax; provided, however, that interest income derived from it from a depository bank under the expanded foreign currency deposit system shall be subject to 15% [2] final withholding tax pursuant to Section 27 (D) (1) in relation to Section 57 (A), both of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended. Moreover, it is required to file on or before April 15 of each year a profit and loss statement and balance sheet with the annual information return under oath, stating its gross income and expenses incurred during the year and a certificate showing that there has not been any change in its By-Laws, Articles of Incorporation, manner of operation and activities as well as resources and disposition of income.\n\nValue-Added Tax or Percentage Tax\n\nVERMONT PARK RESIDENTS ASSOCIATION, INC.'s gross receipts from association dues, membership fees, and other assessment/charges collected in purely reimbursement basis by a homeowners' association are not subject to VAT [3] or percentage tax. However, gross receipts from the operation not derived from rental of its facilities, association dues, membership fees, other assessment and charges collected in purely reimbursement basis shall be subject to the 12% VAT imposed under Section 108 of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, or to the three percent (3%) tax imposed under Section 116 in relation to Section 109 (BB) of the same Code if the gross sales or receipts from such sale of goods and services do not exceed Three Million Pesos (P3,000,000.00). [4] cHDAIS\n\nIt should be understood that VERMONT PARK RESIDENTS ASSOCIATION, INC. shall be constituted as withholding agent of the government if it acts as an employer and its employees receive compensation income subject to the withholding tax under Section 57 of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended.\n\nFinally, VERMONT PARK RESIDENTS ASSOCIATION, INC. is also subject to the payment of the annual registration fee of PhP500.00 as prescribed in Section 236 (B) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended. It is also required under Section 6 (C) in relation to Section 237 of the same Code to issue duly registered receipts for services rendered which do not comprise income from association dues and rentals of their facilities.\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be disclosed that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R.

Mercado\nChairman & President\n\nGentlemen :\n\nThis refers to your request for a confirmatory ruling that the sale by EEI Retirement Fund, Inc. (\"ERFI\"), as trustee, of a parcel of land registered under the name of ERFI in trust for the EEI Corporation Retirement Fund, is exempt from income tax under Section 60 (B) of the 1997 Tax Code, as amended, and consequently, from the creditable withholding tax.\n\nIt is represented that the EEI Corporation Retirement Fund was created to implement the provisions of the EEI Retirement Plan for the exclusive benefit of the employees of the EEI Corporation; that in BIR Ruling No. ERP-73-2003 dated April 24, 2003, the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) declared EEI Retirement Plan as a reasonable retirement plan within the contemplation of law; that the subsequent amendments made in the Retirement Plan Rules in 2009 were also approved by the BIR in BIR Ruling No. ERP No. 281-2009; and that since 2009 to date, no amendments were made in the Retirement Plan, hence, it remained to be a reasonable private benefit plan within the contemplation of Section 32 (B) (6) (a) of the 1997 Tax Code, as amended.\n\nIt is further represented that EEI Corporation Retirement Fund acquired a parcel of land which was registered under the name of ERFI in trust for the EEI Corporation Retirement Fund as evidenced by Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. ________ issued by the Registry of Deeds for Quezon City.\n\nBased on the foregoing representations, you now request confirmation that the sale of the subject parcel of land by EEI Corporation Retirement Fund is not subject to income tax, and consequently, to the creditable withholding tax, in accordance with Section 60 (B) of the 1997 Tax Code, as amended.\n\nIn reply, please be informed that the governing provision relative to the tax exemption of income derived by a retirement benefit fund is Section 60 (B) of the 1997 Tax Code, as amended, to wit: HSAcaE\n\n\"Section 60(B). Imposition of Tax. \u2014\n\n(B) Exception. \u2014 The tax imposed by this Title shall not apply to employee's trust which forms part of a pension, stock bonus or profit-sharing plan of an employer for the benefit of some or all of his employees (1) if contributions are made to the trust by such employer, or employees, or both for the purpose of distributing to such employees the earnings and principal of the fund accumulated by the trust in accordance with such plan, and (2) if under the trust instrument it is impossible, at any time prior to the satisfaction of all liabilities with respect to employees under the trust, for any part of the corpus or income to be (within the taxable year or thereafter) used for, or diverted to, purposes other than for the exclusive benefit of his employees: Provided, That any amount actually distributed to any employee or distributee shall be taxable to him in the year in which so distributed to the extent that it exceeds the amount contributed by such employee or distributee.\"\n\nThe above-cited provision sets forth two (2) conditions in order that the earnings of a retirement fund may be exempt from income tax, viz.: 1) the contributions are made to the trust by the employer, or employees, or both for the purpose of distributing to such employees the earnings and principal of the fund accumulated by the trust in accordance with such plan; and (2) under the trust instrument it is impossible, at any time prior to the satisfaction of all liabilities with respect to employees under the trust, for any part of the corpus or income to be used for, or diverted to, purposes other than for the exclusive benefit of the employees. (BIR Ruling No. ERP-040-2014 dated March 25, 2014). These two (2) conditions are sufficiently met by the EEI Corporation Retirement Plan as in fact, this Office had already approved the same as a reasonable retirement benefit plan in BIR Ruling No. ERP-73-2003 and BIR Ruling No. ERP-281-2009.\n\nIt bears mentioning that the tax exemption of the income derived by a retirement fund from its investments had already been settled in the case of Commissioner of Internal Revenue vs. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 95022, promulgated on March 23, 1992, where the Supreme Court upheld the judgment of the respondent Court of Appeals which affirmed the decision of the Court of Tax Appeals, the pertinent portion of which is quoted below:\n\n\". . . it is significant to note that the GCL Plan was qualified as exempt from income tax by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue in accordance with Republic Act (R.A.) No. 4917 approved on June 17, 1967. This law specifically provided:\n\n\"Sec. 1. Any provision of law to the contrary notwithstanding, the retirement benefits received by officials and employees of private firms, whether individual or corporate, in accordance with a reasonable private benefit plan maintained by the employer shall be exempt from all taxes and shall not be liable to attachment, levy or seizure by or under any legal or equitable process whatsoever except to pay a debt of the official or employee concerned to the private benefit plan or that arising from liability imposed in a criminal action\";\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n\"And rightly so, by virtue of the raison de'etre behind the creation of employees' trusts. Employees' trusts or benefit plans normally provide economic assistance to employees upon occurrence of certain contingencies, particularly, old age retirement, death, sickness, or disability. It provides security against certain hazards to which members of the Plan may be exposed. It is an independent and additional source of protection for the working group. What is more, it is established for their exclusive benefit and for no other purpose.\n\n\"The tax advantage in R.A. No. 1983, Section 56(b), was conceived in order to encourage the formation and establishment of such private plans for the benefit of laborers and employees outside of the Social Security Act. Enlightening is a portion of the explanatory note to H.B. No. 6503, now R.A. 1983, reading:\n\n\"Considering that under Section 17 of the Social Security Act, all contributions collected and payments of sickness, unemployment, retirement, disability and death benefits made thereunder together with the income of the pension trust are exempt from any tax, assessment, fee, or charge, it is proposed that a similar system providing for retirement, etc. benefits for employees outside the Social Security Act be exempted from income taxes.\" (Congressional Record, House of Representatives, Vol. IV, Part 2, No. 57, p. 1859, May 3, 1957; cited in Commissioner of Internal Revenue vs. Visayan Electric Co., et al., G.R. No. L-22611, May 27, 1968, 23 SCRA 715).\n\n\"It is evident that tax-exemption is likewise to be enjoyed by the income of the pension trust. Otherwise, taxation of those earnings would result in a diminution of accumulated income and reduce whatever the trust beneficiaries would receive out of the trust fund. This would run afoul of the very intent of the law. HESIcT\n\nxxx xxx xxx\"\n\nThe above pronouncement of the Supreme Court was reiterated in the subsequent case of Miguel J. Ossorio Pension Foundation, Incorporated vs. Court of Appeals and Commissioner of Internal Revenue, G.R. No. 162175, June 28, 2010.\n\nAccordingly, the EEI Corporation Retirement Plan, being a reasonable retirement benefit plan established for the benefits of the employees of EEI Corporation, is exempt from income tax, and consequently, from creditable withholding tax, on its sale of a parcel of land covered by TCT No. _____ issued by the Registry of Deeds for Quezon City.\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be disclosed that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R.

Espina\nFe B. Magpantay\n\nGentlemen :\n\nThis refers to your letter dated August 18, 2017, filed in behalf of your client, ZENAIDA S. SARTE (\"Mrs. Sarte\"), requesting for confirmation that BIR Ruling No. 156-98 (DA-336-08) dated June 3, 2008 which ruled that \"stock dividends issued after the death of a stockholder no longer forms part of the inventory of assets of the deceased stockholder as these already belong to his heirs and that said stock dividends can be transferred to his heirs, without the necessity of having the Certificate Authorizing Registration and Tax Clearance Certificate amended.\"\n\nThe facts as culled from your letter are as follows:\n\n1. Edgar S. Sarte (\"Edgar\") was the owner of _____________ (___) shares of stock in Manulife covered by Share Ownership Statement No. _________ with MFC Reference No. _________ (the \"Manulife Shares\");\n\n2. On December 23, 2003, Edgar died in Muntinlupa City, Metro Manila;\n\n3. After Edgar's death, Mrs. Sarte filed a Petition for Judicial Settlement of his Estate before the Regional Trial Court of Muntinlupa, Branch 203 (\"the Court\");\n\n4. Proceedings were held and the Court issued an Order dated September 2, 2011 and the Certificate of Finality dated September 29, 2011, settling the deceased Edgar's Estate and adjudicating the Manulife shares to his legitimate wife, Mrs. Sarte;\n\n5. The corresponding estate taxes were paid in full and the BIR Revenue District Office No. 53-B issued Certificate Authorizing Registration (the \"CAR\") No. _________ dated April 19, 2016 covering the deceased Edgar's Estate; aDSIHc\n\n6. On March 23, 2017 and on behalf of Mrs. Sarte, all the documents were submitted and the processing fee was paid to RCBC, acting as Manulife's Transfer Agent, for the transfer of the Manulife Shares from the deceased Edgar to Mrs. Sarte;\n\n7. It was at that time when RCBC informed Mrs. Sarte and counsel that the deceased Edgar has total of ______________ (___) shares of stock in Manulife because an additional ______________ (___) shares of stock were declared as dividends on June 2, 2006 or after Edgar's death (the \"Manulife Stock Dividends\");\n\n8. RCBC was then informed that since the estate tax due on the deceased Edgar's Estate, including the Manulife Shares, were fully paid and the Manulife Stock Dividends were declared after Edgar's death, the transfer of the Manulife Shares and the Manulife Stock Dividends from the deceased Edgar to Mrs. Sarte should be made by RCBC without necessity of amending the CAR;\n\n9. However, RCBC did not transfer the Manulife Shares and the Manulife Stock Dividends to Mrs. Sarte and instead required her to first secure a Certification from the BIR that the BIR Ruling No. 156-98 (DA-336-08) dated June 3, 2008 is still effective.\n\nHence, the request for confirmation.\n\nIn reply, please be informed that \"dividends are recognized as revenue on the date of declaration. The reason is that when dividends are declared, the shareholder acquires the right thereto and a legal liability binding on the corporation is created.\" (Page 678, Financial Accounting, Volume One, First Part, 2013 Edition by Valix, Peralta & Valix)\n\nSection 777 of the Civil Code of the Philippines, provides:\n\n\"ART. 777. The rights to the succession are transmitted from the moment of the death of the decedent.\"\n\nFor purposes of determining the estate tax, Section 85 of the Tax Code of 1997, amended, identifies what constitutes the gross estate of a decedent. It includes the value of all property, real or personal, tangible or intangible, wherever situated, owned by the decedent at the time of his death.\n\nPursuant to Section 97 of the same Code, the heirs must submit to the Corporate Secretary a certification from the BIR that the estate tax has been paid or that the estate is exempt from payment of the said tax as a condition precedent for the acquisition of ownership over the shares, viz.:\n\n\"SEC. 97. Payment of Tax Antecedent to the Transfer of Shares, Bonds or Rights. \u2014 There shall not be transferred to any new owner in the books of any corporation, sociedad anonima, partnership, business, or industry organized or established in the Philippines any share, obligation, bond or right by way of gift inter vivos or mortis causa, legacy or inheritance, unless a certification from the Commissioner that the taxes fixed in this Title and due thereon have been paid is shown.\" (BIR Ruling No. DA-336-08, June 3, 2008)\n\nThus, Edgar's Properties, including the 545 Manulife Shares, are transmitted to his heirs through his death by virtue of intestate succession. From that time on, Edgar ceased to be its owner and any gain or benefit, such as stock dividend, realized from the 545 Manulife Shares shall then on be accounted or credited to the heirs as the owners thereof. Conversely speaking, the 545 Manulife Shares of stock issued as stock dividends shall no longer form part of the inventory of assets of the decedent as they already belong to the heirs.\n\nBased on the foregoing, since the stock dividends were declared on June 2, 2006 when the ownership of the original 545 Manulife Shares has long been transmitted to Edgar's heirs, this Office confirms your opinion that the Manulife shares issued as stock dividends can be transferred to Edgar's heirs without amending the Certificate Authorizing Registration and Tax Clearance Certificate.\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be ascertained that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void. ETHIDa\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R. DULAY\nCommissioner of Internal Revenue",

HTcADC\n\nIn reply, please be informed as follows:\n\nIncome Tax\n\nSection 5 of RA No. 8367 provides that:\n\n\"SECTION 5. Tax Exemption. \u2014 An Association shall be exempt from payment of tax in respect to income it receives, including interest on its deposits with any bank; Provided, however, That income derived from any of its properties, real or personal, or any activity conducted for profit, regardless of the disposition thereof, is subject to the corresponding internal revenue taxes imposed under the National Internal Revenue Code.\n\nInterest earnings on deposits of members with Associations, as well as the shares of its members from the net income of the Associations shall be exempt from income tax.\"\n\nBased on the foregoing, SUPREME COURT SAVINGS AND LOAN ASSOCIATION, INC. shall be exempt from income tax with respect to income it receives. Also, interest income derived by it from its deposit and deposit substitutes is exempt from twenty percent (20%) final withholding tax. (BIR Ruling No. 046-15 dated February 11, 2015 and BIR Ruling No. 460-14 dated November 13, 2014)\n\nHowever, any income derived by SUPREME COURT SAVINGS AND LOAN ASSOCIATION, INC. from any of its properties, real or personal, or any activity conducted for profit, regardless of the disposition thereof, is subject to the applicable income tax and other internal revenue taxes imposed under National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended. It is subject to the applicable income tax depending on the classification of its properties as capital or ordinary asset. CAIHTE\n\nGross Receipts Tax\n\nSection 4 of Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 9-2004, as amended, implementing Section 122 of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended, provides for the imposition of Gross Receipts Tax (GRT) on Non-bank Financial Intermediaries. Section 4 of RR No. 9-2004 states that:\n\n\"SECTION 4. Imposition of Gross Receipts Tax on Other Non-bank Financial Intermediaries. \u2014 Gross receipts of other non-bank financial intermediaries (non-bank financial intermediary not performing quasi-banking functions) doing business in the Philippines shall be subject to GRT at rates and on items of income provided hereunder:\n\n(a) From interest, commissions, discounts and all other items treated as gross income under the Code \u2014 5%\n\n(b) On interests, commissions and discounts from lending activities as well as income from financial leasing, on the basis of remaining maturities of the instruments from which such receipts are derived:\n\nMaturity period is five (5) years or less \u2014 5%\n\nMaturity period is more than five (5) years \u2014 1%\n\nxxx xxx xxx\"\n\nThus, SUPREME COURT SAVINGS AND LOAN ASSOCIATION, INC. is generally subject to GRT on income derived from its operations, unless otherwise exempted under special rules.\n\nDocumentary Stamp Tax\n\nAs provided under Section 5 of RA No. 8367, a non-stock savings and loan association is only exempt from income tax. Thus, SUPREME COURT SAVINGS AND LOAN ASSOCIATION, INC., as a non-bank financial intermediary, is subject to Documentary Stamp Tax (DST) under the provisions of RR No. 13-2004 implementing Title VII of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended, particularly on loan agreements, mortgages, pledges, foreclosures and sales, among others.\n\nMoreover, pursuant to RR No. 9-2000, whenever SUPREME COURT SAVINGS AND LOAN ASSOCIATION, INC. is one of the parties to a taxable transaction, it shall be responsible for the remittance of the DST due regardless of who will bear the burden of paying the DST. aScITE\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be disclosed that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R.

It is duly registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) with Registration No. CS200725744. It is also registered with the BIR on February 12, 2007, with Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) 000-000-000, under Line of Business of general construction business with the following PSIC Codes 4532, 5143, 5190, 5234 and 7122.\n\nIt is organized as a general construction business and its primary purpose is to engage in general construction, including the construction, enlarging, developing or engaging in any work upon building, houses and condominium, roads, plants, bridges, airfields, piers, waterworks, and other structures, buying and selling of general construction materials and supplies and its accessories as steel bars, cements and all elements as paints, plywood, electrical supplies and others. AaCTcI\n\nAs a general construction business, BGRCDC did not engage in real estate business nor advertise or hold itself out in public as engaged in buying and selling of real estate properties. BGRCDC owns a parcel of land for investment purposes and not for sale or lease in the ordinary course of business. The parcel of land (\"subject real property\" for brevity) is covered by Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 092-2017003940 with an area of 5,570 square meters located at Poblacion, Bacolod City.\n\nSince its acquisition, the subject real property was not developed nor utilized by BGRCDC in its operations. It does not form part of its inventory nor was held primarily for sale in the ordinary course of trade or business and has been recorded and reported in the Audited Financial Statements (AFS) of BGRCDC as \"Investment Properties\" and disclosed under Notes to Financial Statement No. 6, \"land for capital appreciation.\" The subject real property was never claimed as depreciable expense as can be seen in its audited financial statements and Income Tax Return (ITR). To prove that it is an idle lot and has never been used in business of the subject real property, the concerned Barangay issued a certification stating such fact. Also, the concerned Office of the City Assessor of Bacolod City issued a Certification for Land with No Improvement stating that \"records of this Office do not show of any residential house/improvement/s situated on the property/ties.\"\n\nBGRCDC executed a Deed of Absolute Sale over the subject real property in favor of Tri Star Megalink Corporation. The corresponding taxes due on the sale of the said real property were already paid. Hence, this query on whether or not the subject real property owned by BGRCDC for investment and capital appreciation purposes is considered capital asset.\n\nIn reply, please be informed that the term \"capital asset\" as negatively defined in Section 39 (A) (1) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, means property held by the taxpayer (whether or not connected with his trade or business), but does not include stock in trade of the taxpayer or other property of a kind which would properly be included in the inventory of the taxpayer if on hand at the close of the taxable year, or property held by the taxpayer primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of his trade or business, or property used in the trade or business, of a character which is subject to the allowance for depreciation provided in Subsection (F) of Section 34, or real property used in trade or business of the taxpayer.\n\nAn idle property may be classified as capital or ordinary asset. Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 7-2003, particularly Section 3 (e) thereof, provides to wit:\n\n\"SEC. 3. GUIDELINES IN DETERMINING WHETHER A PARTICULAR REAL PROPERTY IS A CAPITAL ASSET OR ORDINARY ASSET. \u2014\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\ne. Treatment of abandoned and idle real properties. \u2014 Real properties formerly forming part of the stock in trade of a taxpayer engaged in the real estate business, or formerly being used in the trade or business of a taxpayer engaged or not engaged in the real estate business, which were later on abandoned and became idle, shall continue to be treated as ordinary assets. Real property initially acquired by a taxpayer engaged in the real estate business shall not result in its conversion into a capital asset even if the same is subsequently abandoned or becomes idle.\n\nProvided however, that properties classified as ordinary assets for being used in business by a taxpayer engaged in business other than real estate business as defined in Section 2(g) hereof are automatically converted into capital assets upon showing of proof that the same have not been used in business for more than two (2) years prior to the consummation of the taxable transactions involving said properties. (Emphasis supplied) EcTCAD\n\nBased on the above, an idle property classified as ordinary asset is automatically converted into capital asset upon showing of proof that the same has not been used in business for more than two (2) years prior to the consummation of the taxable transaction involving said properties. The automatic conversion of property into capital asset provided in RR No. 7-2003, however, is not necessary when the idle real property is considered capital asset from the moment it was acquired. The subject real property was acquired for investment purposes and recorded/reported by BGRCDC as capital asset. The property was never used in the course of trade or business of BGRCDC, or depreciated for that purposes. No improvements were introduced to the subject real property as certified by the concerned City Assessor where the property is located. The concerned Barangay also issued a Certification of Non-Use of the subject real property. More importantly, BGRCDC is not engaged in the real estate business, it did not operate from the time it was incorporated and thus, it has no income-generating activity.\n\nIn view of the foregoing, and considering that BGRCDC is a taxpayer not engaged in the real estate business, being not a real estate dealer, developer or lessor and was organized as a general construction business; that the aforementioned property has been idle and vacant since the time of its acquisition as shown by the Certification of the concerned City Assessor that there is no improvement erected on the land, as well as the Certification of concerned Barangay Chairman where the property is located; that the property has no reported operation or commercial activity; and that the property has been treated in the books of accounts and is reflected in the audited financial statement as investment property and has not been used in the ordinary course of trade or business, it is the considered opinion of this Office that the subject real property described above is classified as capital asset, the conveyance of which is subject to capital gains tax and documentary stamp tax and consequently not subject to VAT and creditable withholding tax. (BIR Ruling Nos. 187-2017 dated April 17, 2017; 634-2017 dated December 19, 2017 and 480-2017 dated October 18, 2017)\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be disclosed that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R.

The transaction is, however, subject to documentary stamp tax under Section 196 of the 1997 Tax Code, as amended.\n\nIt is, however, understood that this Certificate of Tax Exemption is never intended and shall not be construed as giving authority to the concerned Register of Deeds to effect transfer of the land title in the name of the buyer without the necessary certificate of authority to register issued by this Bureau. In this regard, this Certificate shall be presented to the Revenue District Office (RDO) concerned in order for the latter to issue the Certificate Authorizing Registration (CAR). The CAR shall only be issued after the submission of the requirements provided under Revenue Memorandum Order (RMO) No. 15-2003.\n\nThe Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) shall conduct verification and post-audit that the actual occupants of the property transferred under the CMP are qualified beneficiaries and therefore, the seller is entitled to exemption from capital gains tax or income tax imposed under Sections 24 (D) (1) and/or 27 (D) (5) of the 1997 Tax Code, as amended.\n\nThis Certificate is being issued on the basis of the facts and documents as represented and submitted. However, if upon investigation, the BIR ascertains that the facts are different, then this Certificate shall be considered null and void.\n\nIssued this 23rd day of September, 2020.\n\n(SGD.)

Bel Air, Makati City 1226\n\nAttention: AAA\n_______________\n\nGentlemen :\n\nThis refers to your letter dated November 26, 2019 requesting on behalf of Alliance of Non-Stock Savings & Loan Institutions, (ANSLI) Inc. that, a non-stock savings and loan association organized and operated exclusively for the mutual benefit of its members is exempt from the imposition of gross receipts tax (GRT) under Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 09-2016.\n\nIn reply, please be informed that Section 3 of Republic Act (RA) No. 8367 otherwise known as \"An Act Providing for the Regulation of the Organization and Operation of Non-Stock Savings and Loan Associations\" defines non-stock savings and loan associations (NSSLAs) as \"a non-stock, non-profit corporation engaged in the business of accumulating the savings of its members and using such accumulations for loans to members to service the needs of households by providing long term financing for home building and development and for personal finance.\" The said law also provides tax exemption to NSSLAs as provided under Section 5, to wit:\n\n\"SECTION 5. TAX EXEMPTION. \u2014 An Association shall be exempt from payment of tax in respect to income it receives, including interest on its deposits with any bank: Provided, however, That income derived from any of its properties, real or personal, or any activity conducted for profit, regardless of the disposition thereof, is subject to the corresponding internal revenue taxes imposed under the National Internal Revenue Code. Interest earnings on deposits of members with Associations as well as the shares of its members from the net income of the Associations shall be exempt from income tax.\" AScHCD\n\nRevenue Memorandum Circular (RMC) No. 9-2016 was issued to clarify the taxability of NSSLAs for purposes of income tax, gross receipts tax and documentary stamp tax. The said RMC provides that NSSLAs are under the direct supervision and regulation of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) and, for regulatory purposes, they are classified as Non-Bank Financial Intermediaries (NBFIs) under the BSP Manual of Regulations. Hence, NSSLA is generally subject to GRT on income derived from its operations, unless otherwise exempted under existing laws and/or regulations.\n\nRelative thereto, Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 9-2004, entitled \"Implementing Certain Provisions of Republic Act No. 9238, Re-Imposing the Gross Receipts Tax (GRT) on Banks and Non-Bank Financial Intermediaries Performing Quasi-Banking Functions and Other Non-Bank Financial Intermediaries Beginning January 1, 2004\" defines NBFIs as follows:\n\n\"2.3.  Non-bank Financial Intermediaries \u2014 shall refer to persons or entities whose principal functions include the lending, investing or placement of funds or evidences of indebtedness or equity deposited with them, acquired by them or otherwise coursed through them, either for their own account or for the account of others. This includes all entities regularly engaged in the lending of funds or purchasing of receivables or other obligations with funds obtained from the public through the issuance, endorsement or acceptance of debt instruments of any kind for their own account, or through the issuance of certificates of assignment or similar instruments with recourse, trust certificates, or of repurchase agreements, whether any of these means of obtaining funds from the public is done on a regular basis or only occasionally.\"\n\nClearly, RR No. 9-2004 imposes GRT on NBFIs engaged in the lending of funds or purchasing of receivables or obligations with funds obtained from the public. RMC No. 9-2016 further clarified that NBFIs are generally subject to GRT on income derived from its operation, unless otherwise exempted under special rules.\n\nNSSLAs must be organized and operated exclusively for the mutual benefit of its members. RA No. 8367 requires that all funds received from members are accumulated to be utilized for the common benefit of the members by providing long term financing for home building and development and for personal finance. In addition, thereto, it expressly exempts NSSLAs from payment of tax in respect to income they receive, including interest on their deposits with any bank.\n\nBased on the foregoing, NSSLAs are subject to GRT if they are engaged in the business of being a NBFI as defined under RR No. 9-2004, that is, if the NSSLAs are obtaining funds from the public. AcICHD\n\nOn the other hand, NSLLA, may be exempt from GRT if they can prove that they do not engage in activities as NBFI as defined under RR No. 9-2004. This Office, however, cannot confirm the exemption from GRT of members of ANSLI based only on the representation that its members are all non-stock savings and loan association organized pursuant to RA No. 8367.\n\nPlease bear in mind that, \"being a non-stock savings and loan association does not, by this reason alone, completely exempt an institution from tax.\" Thus, \"statutes granting tax exemptions are construed strictissimi juris against the taxpayer and liberally in favor of the taxing authority. A claim of tax exemption must be clearly shown and based on language in law too plain to be mistaken. Otherwise stated, taxation is the rule, exemption is the exception. The burden of proof rests upon the party claiming the exemption to prove that it is in fact covered by the exemption so claimed.\" (BIR Ruling No. 466-2014 dated November 19, 2014)\n\nIn view of the foregoing, it is incumbent upon the ANSLI members to prove by way of a confirmatory ruling that it is a non-stock savings and loan association organized pursuant to RA No. 8367 and that they are not engaged in the business of being a NBFI as defined under RR No. 9-2004, that is, they are not obtaining funds from the public, otherwise, they will be considered as NBFI and subject to GRT pursuant to RMC No. 9-2016.\n\nPlease be guided accordingly.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.)

[1]\n\nThe country of residence of the dividend recipients, Ford US, is the United States of America. The US Tax Code allows such a credit on the amount of taxes paid or accrued to any foreign country, as provided in Sections 901 and 902 of its US Internal Revenue Code, thus:\n\n\"SEC. 901.

With respect to the cash dividends on the preferred shares of stock held by KO, on the other hand, the same should be subject to the fifteen percent (15%) final withholding tax under Section 28 (B) (5) (b) of the Tax Code, as amended by R.A. No. 9337, viz.:\n\n(b) Intercorporate Dividends. \u2014 A final withholding tax at the rate of fifteen percent (15%) is hereby imposed on the amount of cash and/or property dividends received from a domestic corporation, which shall be collected and paid as provided in Section 57 (A) of this Code, subject to the condition that the country in which the nonresident foreign corporation is domiciled, shall allow a credit against the tax due from the nonresident foreign corporation taxes deemed to have been paid in the Philippines equivalent to twenty percent (20%), which represents the difference between the regular income tax of thirty-five percent (35%) and the fifteen percent (15%) tax on dividends as provided in this subparagraph: Provided, That effective January 1, 2009, the credit against the tax due shall be equivalent to fifteen percent (15%), which represents the difference between the regular income tax of thirty percent (30%) and the fifteen percent (15%) tax on dividends;\n\nThe tax on inter-corporate dividends is reduced by 20% from 35% to 15% subject to the above-mentioned condition. The tax deemed paid is adjusted to correspond to the decreasing corporate income tax rate. The law specifies that such tax credit for \"taxes deemed paid in the Philippines,\" must, as a minimum, reach an amount equivalent to 20 percentage points which represents the difference between the regular 35% dividend tax rate and the preferred 15% rate. (Commissioner of Internal Revenue vs. Procter & Gamble Philippine Manufacturing Corporation, G.R. 66838, December 2, 1991). In other words, in the instant case, the reduced fifteen percent (15%) dividend tax rate is applicable if the US shall allow tax credit in favor of KO for \"taxes deemed paid in the Philippines\" against its US taxes. HEITAD\n\nThe Supreme Court in Commissioner of Internal Revenue vs. Procter and Gamble Philippine Manufacturing Corp. (P&G) and Court of Tax Appeals (G.R. 66838, December 2, 1991) had occasion to rule that dividends paid to a US resident shall be subject to fifteen percent (15%) dividend tax rate, as follows:\n\nIt is important to note that Section 34(b)(1), NIRC, now Section 25(b)(5)(B) of the Tax Code, does not require that the US must give a \"deemed paid\" tax credit for the dividend tax (20 percentage points) waived by the Philippines in making applicable the preferred dividend tax rate of fifteen percent (15%). In other words, our NIRC does not require that the US tax law deem the parent-corporation to have paid the twenty (20) percentage points of dividends tax waived by the Philippines. The NIRC only requires that the US \"shall allow\" P&G-USA a \"deemed paid\" tax credit in an amount equivalent to the twenty (20) percentage points waived by the Philippines.\n\nIn BIR Ruling No. 175-00, the BIR reiterated the findings of the Supreme Court in the case of Procter and Gamble Philippines Manufacturing Corp. vs. Comm. of Internal Revenue (G.R. No. 66838), saying that it \"has confirmed that Section 901 of the United States Internal Revenue Code meets the 20% deemed tax credit requirement provided under then Section 25 (b) (5) (B) of the 1993 Tax Code [now Section 28 (B) (5) (b)].\n\nIn this connection, therefore, dividends distribution by CCBPI on the preferred shares of stock held by KO shall be subject to the fifteen percent (15%) final withholding tax under Section 28 (B) (5) (b) of the Tax Code.\"\n\nIn view of the foregoing and the fact that the United States of America, where Ford US is registered, allows a credit against the tax due from the non-resident corporation taxes deemed to have been paid in the Philippines, as clearly provided in the US Tax Code, this Office hereby confirms your opinion that the dividends which shall be received by Ford US from the dividends declared by AAP on December 17, 2014 which shall be paid on December 19, 2014 is subject to the fifteen percent (15%) final withholding tax as prescribed under Section 28 (B) (5) (b) of the NIRC of 1997, as amended.\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be disclosed that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R.

GT Tower Int'l.\n6813 Ayala cor. HV dela Costa Sts.\nMakati City 1227\n\nAttention: Ms. Edita C. Encarnacion\nChief Accountant\n\nGentlemen :\n\nThis refers to your letter dated June 20, 2018 requesting for a ruling on the following issues:\n\n1. Is Global Business Holdings, Inc.'s (the \"Company\") real and other properties acquired (ROPA), by virtue of a merger, classified as capital assets or ordinary assets, since the Company is now a holding company?\n\n2. If considered capital assets and the Company sells more than six (6) properties in a year, does this fall under \"habitually engaged in the sale of properties\" for the current year?\n\n3. If the Company sells below six (6) properties this 2018, after it was adjudged to be habitually engaged in the sale of properties in the previous years, how does the Company classify assets sold?\n\nAs represented, the Company (formerly Global Business Bank, Inc.) is a product of three (3) banks which merged in 2000. In 2002, all banking assets and banking liabilities were bought by another bank leaving behind only acquired assets or real properties to the Company. The Company then converted its business activity from financial to a holding/investment company as well as its name from banking to a holding company in order not to mislead on the nature of its business activity.\n\nThe Company lodges the properties under ROPA and pays the corresponding real property tax (RPT) and caretaker fees to safeguard the assets. These properties are in idle state, except for two (2) properties wherein the Company leases them. Since the Company needs to be liquid to maintain its assets, the Company sells various properties. In a year, the Company sells more than six (6) properties and was considered to be habitually engaged in the sale of assets with classification as ordinary assets for tax purposes. cSEDTC\n\nIn reply, please be informed as follows:\n\nWhether real and other properties acquired\n(ROPA) by merger are capital or ordinary\nassets will depend upon peculiar facts and\ncircumstances.\n\nSection 39 (A) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, provides for the definition of capital assets, to wit:\n\n\"Section 39. Capital Gains and Losses. \u2014\n\n(A) Definitions. \u2014 As used in this Title \u2014\n\n(1) Capital Assets. \u2014 The term 'capital assets' means property held by the taxpayer (whether or not connected with his trade or business), but does not include stock in trade of the taxpayer or other property of a kind which would properly be included in the inventory of the taxpayer if on hand at the close of the taxable year, or property held by the taxpayer primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of his trade or business, or property used in the trade or business, of a character which is subject to the allowance for depreciation provided in Subsection (F) of Section 34; or real property used in trade or business of the taxpayer.\"\n\nIn relation to the aforementioned provision, Section 2 (a) of Revenue Regulations (RR) 7-2003, issued on February 11, 2003, defines capital assets as referring to \"all real properties held by a taxpayer, whether or not connected with his trade or business, and which are not included among the real properties considered as ordinary assets under Sec. 39 (A) (1) of the Code.\"\n\nSection 2 (b) thereof laid down what constitutes ordinary assets, as follows:\n\n\"b. Ordinary assets shall refer to all real properties specifically excluded from the definition of capital assets under Sec. 39 (A)(1) of the Code, namely:\n\n1. Stock in trade of a taxpayer or other real property of a kind which would properly be included in the inventory of the taxpayer if on hand at the close of the taxable year; or\n\n2. Real property held by the taxpayer primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of his trade or business; or\n\n3. Real property used in trade or business (i.e., buildings and/or improvements) of a character which is subject to the allowance for depreciation provided for under Sec. 34 (F) of the Code; or\n\n4. Real property used in trade or business of the taxpayer.\n\nReal properties acquired by banks through foreclosure sales are considered as their ordinary assets. However, banks shall not be considered as habitually engaged in the real estate business for purposes of determining the applicable rate of withholding tax imposed under Sec. 2.57.2(J) of Revenue Regulations No. 2-98, as amended.\" (emphasis supplied)\n\nMoreover, Section 3 (a) of the same Regulations provides for the guidelines in determining whether a particular real property is a capital asset or ordinary asset. \u2014\n\n\"a. Taxpayers engaged in the real estate business. \u2014 Real property shall be classified with respect to taxpayers engaged in the real estate business as follows:\n\n1. Real Estate Dealer. \u2014 x x x\n\n2. Real Estate Developer. \u2014 x x x\n\n3. Real Estate Lessor. \u2014 x x x\n\n4. Taxpayers habitually engaged in the real estate business. \u2014 All real properties acquired in the course of trade or business by a taxpayer habitually engaged in the sale of real estate shall be considered as ordinary assets. Registration with the HLURB or HUDCC as a real estate dealer or developer shall be sufficient for a taxpayer to be considered as habitually engaged in the sale of real estate. If the taxpayer is not registered with the HLURB or HUDCC as a real estate dealer or developer, he/it may nevertheless be deemed to be engaged in the real estate business through the establishment of substantial relevant evidence (such as consummation during the preceding year of at least six (6) taxable real estate sale transactions, regardless of amount; registration as habitually engaged in real estate business with the Local Government Unit or the Bureau of Internal Revenue, etc.).\" (emphasis supplied) SDAaTC\n\nSection 3 (a) of RR No. 7-2003 should be read in connection with Revenue Memorandum Circular (RMC) No. 7-90 which provides that a vendor shall be considered \"habitually engaged in real estate business\" if he has consummated, during the preceding year, at least six taxable real estate transactions, regardless of amount. A vendor who has previously been accredited by the Chamber of Real Estate & Builders' Associations, Inc. (CREBA) and registered with the Housing and Urban Development Coordinating Council (HUDCC)/Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board (HLURB) may still be considered habitually engaged in real estate business even if the number of sales made during the year falls below six. The duty of determining whether or not the vendor is habitually engaged in real estate business rests upon the BIR.\n\nEven in the absence of registration therewith, a person may also be treated habitually engaged in the real estate business upon showing that he is in fact actually engaged in the said business. (BIR Ruling No. 296-14 dated July 24, 2014; BIR Ruling No. DA-081-00 dated February 7, 2000; BIR Ruling No. 143-99 dated September 14, 1999; and BIR Ruling No. 059-99 dated April 30, 1999)\n\nIn BIR Ruling No. DA-(C-052) 185-09 dated April 7, 2009, citing BIR Ruling No. 014-2003 dated October 28, 2003, this Office used as basis the \"actual use\" of the property in determining its classification \u2014\n\n\"x x x it is undisputed that the yardstick for determining whether the property is capital asset or ordinary asset is the actual use of the said property. Thus, if the property is not actually used in trade or business of the taxpayer, whether or not connected with his trade or business, or not held for lease or sale to customers, it will be classified as a capital asset. Moreover, if the property is merely held for investment purposes and remains vacant and idle, it is deemed a capital asset.\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\nThe phrase \"taxpayers engaged in the real estate business\" refers collectively to real estate dealers, real estate developers, and/or real estate lessors. Conversely, the term \"taxpayer not engaged in the real estate business\" shall refer to persons other than real estate dealers, real estate developers and/or real estate lessors. A taxpayer whose primary purpose of engaging in business, or whose Articles of Incorporation states that its primary purpose is to engage in the real estate business shall be deemed to be engaged in the real estate business for purposes of these Regulations. (Sec. 2 (g), Revenue Regulations No. 7-2003)\n\nInasmuch as POPI is not primarily engaged in real estate business, but is merely a holding company and as such has interests in real estate and property development, manufacturing and retailing/distribution, financial services and other allied services, organized under several intermediate holding companies, it is deemed not engaged in the real estate business. Consequently, the Mandaue Land is property not primarily held for sale or lease in the regular course of trade or business.\"\n\nHowever, as stated by the Supreme Court in the case of Calasanz, et al. vs. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 144 SCRA 664, there is no fixed formula to determine whether a piece of property is a capital asset or an ordinary asset. Although several factors have been recognized as helpful guides, none is decisive. Each case must, in the last analysis, rest upon its own peculiar facts and circumstances.\n\nDetermination of the classification of\nassets sold during the current year for\npurposes of imposing CGT/CWT.\n\nIt is necessary to first determine the character of the real property being sold (e.g., whether capital asset or ordinary asset) in order to determine whether its sale is subject to capital gains tax (CGT) or creditable withholding tax (CWT).\n\nIf the real property is not actually used in the business of the seller-corporation and is treated as a capital asset, as that term is defined in Section 39 (A) of the 1997 Tax Code, as amended, and as implemented by Section 2 (a) of RR 7-2003, and the seller-corporation is not considered as habitually engaged in the real estate business, the real property is considered as a capital asset. acEHCD\n\nAccordingly, the income derived from the sale thereof is not subject to the expanded withholding tax under Sec. 2.57.2 (J) of RR No. 2-98, as amended by RR 11-2018 but only to the 6% CGT imposed under Section 27 (D) (5) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended. Section 27 (D) (5) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, applies whether or not the seller-corporation is engaged in the real estate business (BIR Ruling No. 027-02 dated July 3, 2002). Moreover, the seller-corporation will be subject to the documentary stamp tax under Section 196 of the same Code, based on the gross selling price or fair market value (FMV) as determined in accordance with Section 6 (E) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, whichever is higher. (BIR Ruling No. 027-02 dated July 3, 2002; BIR Ruling Nos. DA-217-99 dated April 12, 1979; and DA-010-02 dated January 29, 2002).\n\nOn the other hand, if the real property being sold is an ordinary asset, as that term is defined in Section 3 (a) of RR 7-2003, the withholding tax rates imposed under Section 2.57.2 of RR 2-98, as amended by RR 11-2018, shall apply. The rate of withholding tax will depend on whether, first, the seller is exempt or taxable; second, whether the seller is habitually engaged in real estate business or not; and third, the gross selling price, (as that term is defined in the above-mentioned RR) if the seller is habitually engaged in real estate business, (BIR Ruling No. DA-152-04 dated March 31, 2004; BIR Ruling No. 27-02 dated July 3, 2002). Likewise, the seller-corporation will be subject to the documentary stamp tax imposed under Section 196 of the same Code, based on the gross selling price or FMV as determined in accordance with Section 6 (E) of the same Code, whichever is higher. Moreover, since the real properties are treated as ordinary assets of the Company, the sale thereof shall be subject to the 12% value-added tax imposed under Section 108 (A) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended (BIR Ruling No. DA-209-02 dated November 15, 2002).\n\nBased on the foregoing, this Office is of the opinion and so holds \u2014\n\n1) Since real properties acquired by banks through foreclosure sales are considered as their ordinary assets, the Company's ROPA retained its classification as ordinary assets even after the Company has converted its business from a bank to a holding/investment company pursuant to Section 39 (A) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, and as implemented by Section 2 (a) of RR 7-2003.\n\n2) If the ROPA are considered as a capital asset and the Company sells more than six (6) properties in a year, the Company is considered as habitually engaged in the real estate business. Otherwise stated, if the Company sold less than six (6) real properties in the previous year, it will not be considered as habitually engaged in the real estate business for the current year. However, this is a non-issue since as previously stated, the Company's ROPA are considered as ordinary assets.\n\n3) If the Company sells below six (6) real properties in the current year, i.e., 2018, after he/it was adjudged to be habitually engaged in the sale of properties in the previous years, the Company is deemed to be engaged in the real estate business and all real properties owned and acquired by it shall be treated as ordinary assets.

It is noted that the foregoing conditions are present in the DBP Plans, thus, it is exempt from income tax.

No. 4917 approved on June 17, 1967. This law specifically provided:\n\nSec. 1. Any provision of law to the contrary notwithstanding, the retirement benefits received by officials and employees of private firms, whether individual or corporate, in accordance with a reasonable private benefit plan maintained by the employer shall be exempt from all taxes and shall not be liable to attachment, levy or seizure by or under any legal or equitable process whatsoever except to pay a debt of the official or employee concerned to the private benefit plan or that arising from liability imposed in a criminal action;\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\nAnd rightly so, by virtue of the raison de'etre behind the creation of employees' trusts. Employees' trusts or benefit plans normally provide economic assistance to employees upon occurrence of certain contingencies, particularly, old age retirement, death, sickness, or disability. It provides security against certain hazards to which members of the Plan may be exposed. It is an independent and additional source of protection for the working group. What is more, it is established for their exclusive benefit and for no other purpose.\n\nThe tax advantage in R.A. No. 1983, Section 56(b), was conceived in order to encourage the formation and establishment of such private plans for the benefit of laborers and employees outside of the Social Security Act. Enlightening is a portion of the explanatory note to H.B. No. 6503, now R.A. 1983, reading: aScITE\n\n\"Considering that under Section 17 of the Social Security Act, all contributions collected and payments of sickness, unemployment, retirement, disability and death benefits made thereunder together with the income of the pension trust are exempt from any tax, assessment, fee, or charge, it is proposed that a similar system providing for retirement, etc. benefits for employees outside the Social Security Act be exempted from income taxes.\" (Congressional Record, House of Representatives, Vol. IV, Part 2, No. 57, p. 1859, May 3, 1957; cited in Commissioner of Internal Revenue vs. Visayan Electric Co., et al., G.R. No. L-22611, May 27, 1968, 23 SCRA 715).\n\nIt is evident that tax-exemption is likewise to be enjoyed by the income of the pension trust. Otherwise, taxation of those earnings would result in a diminution of accumulated income and reduce whatever the trust beneficiaries would receive out of the trust fund. This would run afoul of the very intent of the law.\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\nThere can be no denying either that the final withholding tax is collected from income in respect of which employees' trusts are declared exempt (Sec. 56(b), now Sec. 53(b), National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended). The application of the withholding system to interest on bank deposits or yield from deposit substitutes is essentially to maximize and expedite the collection of income taxes by requiring its payment at the source. If an employees' trust like the GCL enjoys a tax-exempt status from income, we see no logic in withholding a certain percentage of that income which it is not supposed to pay in the first place.\"\n\nIn view of the foregoing, interest income derived by the DBP Plans from investment in government securities, Philippine currency bank deposit, deposit substitutes and BSP special deposit accounts is exempt from the income tax and, consequently, from the final withholding tax pursuant to Section 60 (B) of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended. [2]\n\nIt must be emphasized, however, that in its investment activities, no part of the corpus or income of the DBP Plans shall be used for or diverted to purposes other than for the exclusive benefit of the member-employees/officials or their beneficiaries.\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it shall be disclosed that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R.

C. Salvador St., Labangon, Cebu City and covered by Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. ____________ issued by the Registry of Deeds of Cebu City; that the aforesaid lot was acquired through Self-help Socialized Housing Program of City Government of Cebu, involving Thirty Two (32) beneficiaries, under City Resolution No. ______; that on November 06, 2018, a Deed of Partition with Conveyance was executed by KATIPUNAN NEIGHBORHOOD HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION, INC. in favor of its member-beneficiaries; and that the member-beneficiaries are now in the process of transferring the purchased subdivided lots to their names.\n\nIn reply, please be informed that the transfer by KATIPUNAN NEIGHBORHOOD HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION, INC. in favor of its member-beneficiaries who have made full payment of their purchased subdivided lot is not subject to either the CGT imposed under Section 27 (D) (5) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, or the creditable withholding tax imposed under Revenue Regulations No. 2-98, as amended, considering that the said transfer of property is made only as a formality to finally effect the transfer of the said property to its member-beneficiaries, who actually bought the same from the former owner through the Association. In other words, the association is merely transferring the ownership of the property to its member-beneficiaries who actually own the afore-described lots.\n\nFurthermore, the said transfer is not subject to the donor's tax imposed under Section 98 the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, since there is no donative intent on the part of the Association to donate the said property to member-beneficiaries, considering that it could not donate property the ownership of which already belongs to the member-beneficiaries. (BIR Ruling No. 034-2015 dated February 5, 2015)\n\nIt is noted that under Section 196 of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, the deeds or documents subject to the documentary stamp tax (DST) imposed therein are those where the realty sold shall be granted, assigned, transferred, or otherwise conveyed to a purchaser or purchasers or to any other person or persons designated by such purchaser or purchasers, thereby excluding from its purview the instant case considering that the supposed purchaser is actually the owner thereof.\n\nAccordingly, the transfer of title of the subject lot in favor of the member-beneficiaries is not subject to DST under Section 196 of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended. However, the notarial acknowledgement to the deed of conveyance is subject to the documentary stamp tax of P30.00 pursuant to Section 188 of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended by RA 10963 (TRAIN Law).\n\nIt is, however, understood that the Certificate Authorizing Registration (CAR) shall only be issued after the submission of the requirements provided under RMO 15-2003 and after it is established upon proper verification by the Revenue District Officer (RDO) concerned that, considering the rules on valuation of real property, the actual selling price per sale transaction in this case does not exceed ___________ for house and lot and ___________ for lot only for each qualified beneficiaries. (BIR Ruling No. 034-2015 dated February 5, 2015)\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented.

(Primus) to Citibank Overseas Investment Corporation (COIC) is not subject to capital gains tax.\n\nIt is represented that CBNA Ret Plan Fund B is a reasonable employee retirement benefit plan, duly registered with and approved by the Bureau of Internal Revenue under Ruling No. ERP-71-2005 dated April 21, 2005; that it is the beneficial owner of 270,000 Common A shares and 11,000 Preferred B shares of stock in Primus Holdings, Inc.,a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the Republic of the Philippines.\n\nOn September 25, 2017, pursuant to a Deed of Sale of Shares, CBNA Ret Plan Fund B sold the said shares to Citibank Overseas Investment Corporation for a total consideration of P____________. In connection therewith, you now request confirmation of your opinion that the income earned by CBNA Ret Plan Fund B from the sale of its investments in shares of stock is exempt from capital gains tax under Section 27 (D) (2) of the Tax Code of 1997 pursuant to Section 60 (B) of the same Code.\n\nIn reply, please be informed that the governing provision relative to the tax exemption of income derived by a retirement benefit fund is Section 60 (B) of the 1997 Tax Code, as amended, which states that:\n\n\"Section 60(B).Imposition of Tax. \u2014\n\n(B) Exception. \u2014 The tax imposed by this Title shall not apply to employee's trust which forms part of a pension, stock bonus or profit-sharing plan of an employer for the benefit of some or all of his employees (1) if contributions are made to the trust by such employer, or employees, or both for the purpose of distributing to such employees the earnings and principal of the fund accumulated by the trust in accordance with such plan, and (2) if under the trust instrument it is impossible, at any time prior to the satisfaction of all liabilities with respect to employees under the trust, for any part of the corpus or income to be (within the taxable year or thereafter) used for, or diverted to, purposes other than for the exclusive benefit of his employees: Provided, That any amount actually distributed to any employee or distributee shall be taxable to him in the year in which so distributed to the extent that it exceeds the amount contributed by such employee or distributee. ASEcHI\n\nThe above-cited provision sets forth two (2) conditions in order that the earnings of a retirement fund may be exempt from income tax, to wit: 1) the contributions are made to the trust by the employer, or employees, or both for the purpose of distributing to such employees the earnings and principal of the fund accumulated by the trust in accordance with such plan; and (2) under the trust instrument it is impossible, at any time prior to the satisfaction of all liabilities with respect to employees under the trust, for any part of the corpus or income to be used for, or diverted to, purposes other than for the exclusive benefit of the employees. (BIR Ruling No. ERP-040-2014 dated March 25, 2014).These two (2) conditions are sufficiently met by the Retirement Fund as in fact, this Office had already approved the same as a reasonable retirement benefit plan in BIR Certification/Ruling dated April 6, 1979, BIR Ruling dated April 23, 1981, BIR Ruling No. ERP-054-92 dated April 28, 1992, and BIR Ruling No. ERP-38-08 dated February 19, 2008.\n\nIt bears mentioning that the tax exemption of the income derived by a retirement fund from its investments had already been settled in the case of Commissioner of Internal Revenue vs. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 95022,promulgated on March 23, 1992, where the Supreme Court upheld the judgment of the respondent Court of Appeals which affirmed the decision of the Court of Tax Appeals, the pertinent portion of which is quoted below:\n\n\"...it is significant to note that the GCL Plan was qualified as exempt from income tax by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue in accordance with Republic Act (R.A.) No. 4917 approved on June 17, 1967. This law specifically provided:\n\nSec. 1. Any provision of law to the contrary notwithstanding, the retirement benefits received by officials and employees of private firms, whether individual or corporate, in accordance with a reasonable private benefit plan maintained by the employer shall be exempt from all taxes and shall not be liable to attachment, levy or seizure by or under any legal or equitable process whatsoever except to pay a debt of the official or employee concerned to the private benefit plan or that arising from liability imposed in a criminal action;\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\nAnd rightly so, by virtue of the raison de'etre behind the creation of employees' trusts. Employees' trusts or benefit plans normally provide economic assistance to employees upon occurrence of certain contingencies, particularly, old age retirement, death, sickness, or disability. It provides security against certain hazards to which members of the Plan may be exposed. It is an independent and additional source of protection for the working group. What is more, it is established for their exclusive benefit and for no other purpose.\n\nThe tax advantage in R.A. No. 1983, Section 56(b),was conceived in order to encourage the formation and establishment of such private plans for the benefit of laborers and employees outside of the Social Security Act. Enlightening is a portion of the explanatory note to H.B. No. 6503, now R.A. 1983, reading:\n\nConsidering that under Section 17 of the Social Security Act, all contributions collected and payments of sickness, unemployment, retirement, disability and death benefits made thereunder together with the income of the pension trust are exempt from any tax, assessment, fee, or charge, it is proposed that a similar system providing for retirement, etc. benefits for employees outside the Social Security Act be exempted from income taxes.\" (Congressional Record, House of Representatives, Vol. IV, Part 2, No. 57, p. 1859, May 3, 1957; cited in Commissioner of Internal Revenue vs. Visayan Electric Co.,et al.,G.R. No. L-22611, May 27, 1968, 23 SCRA 715).\n\nIt is evident that tax exemption is likewise to be enjoyed by the income of the pension trust. Otherwise, taxation of those earnings would result in a diminution of accumulated income and reduce whatever the trust beneficiaries would receive out of the trust fund. This would run afoul of the very intent of the law.\n\nxxx xxx xxx\"\n\nThe above pronouncement of the Supreme Court was reiterated in the subsequent case of Miguel J. Ossorio Pension Foundation, Incorporated vs. Court of Appeals and Commissioner of Internal Revenue, G.R. No. 162175, June 28, 2010.\n\nIn view of the foregoing, this Office hereby confirms your opinion that the sale of CBNA Ret Plan Fund B of its 270,000 Common A shares and 11,000 Preferred B shares in Primus Holdings to Citibank Overseas Investment Corporation for a total consideration of P______________ is not subject to capital gains tax and consequently from the creditable expanded withholding tax prescribed under Revenue Regulations No. 2-98, as amended. cTDaEH\n\nHowever, the sale of the aforesaid shares of stock in Primus by CBNA Ret Plan Fund B to COIC is subject to documentary stamp tax at the rate of Php0.75 [1] on each Php200.00, or fractional part thereof, of the par value of such stock as prescribed in Section 176 of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended by Republic Act No. 9243 and as implemented by Revenue Regulations No. 13-2004.\n\nFinally, the exemption from income tax does not include stock transaction tax which is a percentage tax under Title V of the 1997 Tax Code, as amended. Thus, income from investment in shares of stocks listed and traded in the local stock exchange shall be subject to the stock transaction tax imposed under Section 127 (A) of the same Code.\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be disclosed that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered as null and void.\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R.

ALABANG NUMBERS is a holder of various Gaming Licenses [1] for its Electronic Games Operations which was issued by PAGCOR pursuant to PD No. 1869, as amended by RA No. 9487.\n\nIn reply, please be informed that Section 13 (2) of PD No. 1869, as amended by RA No. 9487, provides, viz.:\n\n\"SEC. 13. Exemptions.\u2014\n\n(2) Income and other taxes \u2014 (a) Franchise Holder: No tax of any kind or form, income or otherwise, as well as fees, charges or levies of whatever nature, whether National or Local, shall be assessed and collected under this Franchise from the Corporation, nor shall any form of tax or charge attach in any way to the earnings of the Corporation, except a Franchise Tax of five (5%) percent of the gross revenue or earnings derived by the Corporation from its operation under this Franchise.Such tax shall be due and payable quarterly to the National Government and shall be in lieu of all kinds of taxes, levies, fees or assessments of any kind, nature or description, levied, established or collected by any municipal, provincial, or national government authority. AaCTcI\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(b) Others: The exemption herein granted for earnings derived from the operations conducted under the franchise, specifically from the payment of any tax, income or otherwise, as well as any form of charges, fees or levies, shall inure to the benefit of and extend to corporation(s),association(s),agency(ies),or individual(s) with whom the Corporation or operator has any contractual relationship in connection with the operations of the casino(s) authorized to be conducted under this Franchise and to those receiving compensation or other remuneration from the Corporation or operator as a result of essential facilities furnished and/or technical services rendered to the Corporation or operator.(Emphasis and underscoring supplied)\n\nIn the case of Bloomberry Resorts and Hotels, Inc. vs. Bureau of Internal Revenue,[2] the Supreme Court affirmed the applicability of the tax exemption provisions of PD No. 1869, as amended by RA No. 9487, to PAGCOR's licensees. Thus, the Supreme Court ruled that:\n\n\"As the PAGCOR Charter states in unequivocal terms that exemptions granted for earnings derived from the operations conducted under the franchise specifically from the payment of any tax, income or otherwise, as well as any form of charges, fees or levies, shall inure to the benefit of and extend to corporation(s),association(s),agency(ies),or individual(s) with whom the PAGCOR or operator has any contractual relationship in connection with the operations of the casino(s) authorized to be conducted under this Franchise, so it must be that all contractees and licensees of PAGCOR,upon payment of the 5% franchise tax, shall likewise be exempted from all other taxes, including corporate income tax realized from the operation of casinos.\n\nFor the same reasons that made us conclude in the December 10, 2014 Decision of the Court sitting En Banc in G.R. No. 215427 that PAGCOR is subject to corporate income tax for \"other related services,\" we find it logical that its contractees and licensees shall likewise pay corporate income tax for income derived from such \"related services.\"\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\nPlainly, too, upon payment of the 5% franchise tax, petitioner's income from its gaming operations of gambling casinos, gaming clubs and other similar recreation or amusement places, and gaming pools, defined within the purview of the aforesaid section, is not subject to corporate income tax.\" (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)\n\nWith regard to the VAT exemption of ALABANG NUMBERS, Section 109 (1) (K) of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended, provides:\n\n\"SEC. 109. Exempt Transactions.\u2014 (1) Subject to the provisions of Subsection (2) hereof, the following transactions shall be exempt from the value-added tax:\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(K) Transactions which are exempt under international agreements to which the Philippines is a signatory or under special laws,except those under Presidential Decree No. 529;(Emphasis supplied)\n\nThus, PAGCOR and its licensees are exempt from the payment of VAT because PAGCOR's charter, PD No. 1869, is a special law that grants the latter exemption from taxes and such exemptions extend or inure to the benefit of its licensees. [3] EcTCAD\n\nPremises considered, this Office hereby rules that since ALABANG NUMBERS is a holder of Gaming Licenses for its Electronic Games operations issued by PAGCOR, the exemption from taxes, fees and charges enjoyed by PAGCOR is extended to ALABANG NUMBERS pursuant to Section 13 (2) (b) of PD No. 1869, as amended by RA No. 9487. Therefore, the income derived by ALABANG NUMBERS solely from its Electronic Games Operations, during the validity period of its Gaming Licenses on the specified gaming sites, is subject only to the 5% franchise tax, and shall be exempted from corporate income tax and VAT. However, for the purpose of applying the 5% franchise tax, any income that may be realized by ALABANG NUMBERS from related services or such services not falling under gaming operations, shall be subject to corporate income tax and VAT. [4]\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it shall be disclosed that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R.

International Exchange, Inc.\n\nUnit 1006 One World Place Condominium\nBlock 7 Lot 5, 32nd Street,\nBonifacio Global City, Taguig City\n\nAttention: AAA\n\nGentlemen :\n\nThis has reference to your letter dated December 10, 2019 requesting on behalf of Lulu-Phils. International Exchange, Inc. (\"Lulu Phils., Inc.\"), for a ruling on the proper treatment on the imposition of documentary stamp tax (DST) under Section 181 of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) of 1997, as amended, with regard to transactions where it is merely acting as a mediator of its Parent Company and payout partner banks and non-bank money transfer agents.\n\nIt is represented that Lulu Phils., Inc. is a domestic corporation duly organized and registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) with Certificate of Registration No. CS200710795 dated August 19, 2011; that it has its principal place of business at Unit 1006 One World Place Condominium, Block 7 Lot 5, 32nd Street, Bonifacio Global City, Taguig City; that it is primarily a financial service company engaged in facilitating fund transfer and providing remittance services either by electronic, telegraphic, wire or any other mode or form of transfer; that it is a subsidiary to its parent company, Lulu International Exchange LLC (\"Lulu International\"), a foreign corporation duly registered in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates (UAE); and that it is acting as remittance service provider/mediator of Lulu International and the corresponding payout bank and non-bank money transfer agents.\n\nLulu International receives foreign remittances in its UAE branches from benefactor-remitter to be remitted to the Philippines. In turn, Lulu International will send communication or instruction to Lulu Phils., Inc. for the purpose of specifying the bank and non-bank money transfer agents where the latter will remit the foreign remittance. It is the obligation of the bank and non-bank money transfer agents to pay out the money transfers to the designated beneficiaries.\n\nLulu Phils., Inc. maintains that it is a mere mediator between its parent company, Lulu International, and the payout partner banks and non-bank money transfer agents. Being a mediator, it is not a party to the remittance transaction, therefore is not under obligation to pay the DST imposed under Section 181 of the NIRC of 1997, as amended. Hence, this query. aDSIHc\n\nIn reply, please be informed that Section 181 of the NIRC of 1997, as amended, provides that:\n\n\"SEC. 181. Stamp Tax Upon Acceptance of Bills of Exchange and Others. \u2014 Upon any acceptance or payment of any bill of exchange or order for the payment of money purporting to be drawn in a foreign country but payable in the Philippines, there shall be collected a documentary stamp tax of Sixty centavos (P0.60) [1] on each Two hundred pesos (P200), or fractional part thereof, of the face value of any such bill of exchange, or order, or the Philippine equivalent of such value, if expressed in foreign currency.\"\n\nThe said provision of law imposes DST on every acceptance or payment of bill of exchange or other bills of exchange or draft for the payment of money drawn in a foreign country but payable in the Philippines.\n\nA bill of exchange under Section 126 of Act No. 2031 otherwise known as the \"Negotiable Instruments Law of the Philippines\" is defined as follows:\n\n\"Sec. 126. Bill of exchange, defined. \u2014 A bill of exchange is an unconditional order in writing addressed by one person to another, signed by the person giving it, requiring the person to whom it is addressed to pay on demand or at a fixed or determinable future time a sum certain in money to order or to bearer.\"\n\nAlso, a bill of exchange was defined under Section 39 of Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 26, to wit:\n\n\"SECTION 39. Definition of \"Bill of Exchange.\" \u2014 The term \"bill of exchange\" denotes checks, drafts, and all other kinds of orders for the payment of money, payable at sight or on demand or after a specific period after sight or from a stated date.\"\n\nMoney remittances from foreign countries fall within the purview of Section 181 of the NIRC of 1997, as amended, thus, liable to DST on their transactions. As a rule, acceptance by beneficiaries of money sent from abroad is subject to DST equivalent to Sixty centavos (P0.60) on each Two Hundred Pesos (P200.00), or fractional part thereof, of the face value or the Philippine equivalent of such value, if expressed in foreign currency.\n\nMoreover, Section 2 (a) of RR No. 9-2000 dated November 22, 2000 provides:\n\n\"Section 2. Nature of the Documentary Stamp Tax and Persons Liable for the Tax. \u2014\n\n(a) In General. \u2014 The documentary stamp taxes under Title VII of the Code is a tax on certain transactions. It is imposed against \"the person making, signing, issuing, accepting, or transferring\" the document or facility evidencing the aforesaid transactions. Thus, in general, it may be imposed on the transaction itself or upon the document underlying such act. Any of the parties thereto shall be liable for the full amount of the tax due: Provided, however, that as between themselves, the said parties may agree on who shall be liable or how they may share on the cost of the tax.\" (Emphasis supplied)\n\nIn the instant case and as represented, the inward remittance transaction is between parent company, Lulu International, the party who makes an order of payment, and the payout partner banks and non-bank money transfer agents, the party required to pay. Lulu Phils., Inc. merely facilitates the fund transfer to designated payout banks and non-bank money transfer agents in accordance with the communications or instructions of its parent company, Lulu International. Thus, in such a situation, Lulu Phils., Inc. is not privy in the actual remittance transactions of money transfer between the sender and the beneficiaries and does not in any manner, accept or pay any bill of exchange or order of payment of money purporting to be drawn in a foreign country payable in the Philippines. Hence, not being a party to the transaction under the aforesaid set up, Lulu Phils., Inc. is not liable for the payment of DST under Section 181 of the NIRC of 1997, as amended. ETHIDa\n\nIt is worthy to mention, however, that transactions between Lulu International and its corresponding payout partner bank and non-bank money transfer agents is considered a money remittance from foreign countries subject to DST in the ambit of Section 181 of the NIRC of 1997, as amended. Since DST is a tax on transaction itself or upon the document underlying such act, any of the parties thereto shall be liable for the full amount of the tax due.\n\nMoreover, Section 3 (c) (4) of RR No. 09-00 provides for the party liable to remit DST:\n\n\"SECTION 3. Mode of Payment and Remittance of the Tax. \u2014\n\n(a) x x x\n\n(c) Person liable to remit the DST. \u2014 In general, the full amount of the tax imposed under Title VII of the Code may be remitted by any of the party or parties to the taxable transaction, except in the following cases:\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(4) When one of the parties to the taxable document or transaction is included in any of the entities enumerated below, such entity shall be responsible for the remittance of the stamp tax prescribed under Title VII of the Code: Provided, however, that if such entity is exempt from the tax herein imposed, it shall remit the tax as a collecting agent, pursuant to the preceding paragraph 3(b)(2) hereof, any provision of these Regulations to the contrary notwithstanding\n\n(a) A bank, a quasi-bank or non-bank financial intermediary, a finance company, or an insurance, a surety, a fidelity, or annuity company;\n\nxxx xxx xxx\"\n\nThus, payout partner banks and non-bank money transfer agents shall be responsible for the payment and remittance of the DST.\n\nHowever, if the remittance is from Overseas Contract Workers (OCWs) or Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs), it shall be exempt from the payment of DST pursuant to Section 35 of Republic Act (RA) No. 8042, [2] as amended by RA No. 10022, [3] to wit:\n\n\"SEC. 35. Exemption from Travel Tax, Documentary Stamp Tax and Airport Fee. \u2014 All laws to the contrary notwithstanding, the migrant workers shall be exempt from the payment of travel tax and airport fee upon proper showing of proof of entitlement by the POEA.\n\nThe remittances of all overseas Filipino workers, upon showing of the same proof of entitlement by the overseas Filipino worker's beneficiary or recipient, shall be exempt from the payment of documentary stamp tax.\" (Underscoring supplied)\n\nThe above provision is implemented by Section 3 of RR No. 1-2011, as amended by RR No. 11-2012, which states that: cSEDTC\n\n\"Section 3. Tax Treatment. \u2014\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\nC) Other Taxes and Fees:\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\nThe remittances of all OCWs or OFWs, upon showing of the OEC, valid Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA) Membership Certificate, or electronic receipt (e-receipt) issued by POEA, by the OCWs or OFW beneficiary recipient, shall be exempt from the payment of documentary stamp tax (DST) as imposed under Section 181 of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended. For this purpose, in addition to the original copy, a duplicate copy or a certified true copy of the valid proof of entitlement referred to above shall be secured by the OCW or OFW from the POEA or OWWA, which shall be held and used by his/her beneficiary in the availment of the DST exemption.\n\nIn case of OCWs or OFWs whose remittances are sent through the banking system, credited to beneficiaries or recipient's account in the Philippines and withdrawn through automatic teller machine (ATM), or sent through non-bank money transfer agents, it shall be the responsibility of the OCW or OFW to show the valid proof of entitlement when making arrangement for his/her remittance transfers.\n\nxxx xxx xxx\" (Emphasis supplied)\n\nBased on the foregoing, if the transaction involves remittances from OCWs or OFWs such transactions will not be subject to payment of DST, provided the abovementioned requirements are complied with by payout partner banks and non-bank money transfer agents.\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be disclosed that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void.\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R.

Gil J. Puyat Avenue\nMakati City\n\nAttention: Mr. Domingo I. Bagaporo\nDirector, (IASD)\n\nGentlemen :\n\nThis refers to your letter requesting, on behalf of Solutions Using Renewable Energy, Inc. (SURE), for clarification on the tax incentives related to renewable energy projects, to wit:\n\n1. Whether the payment for value-added tax (VAT) on importation of capital equipment may be recovered through tax credit; and\n\n2. With regard to its local supply and equipment, how can SURE avail the VAT exemption when it outsources most of its services including the local procurement to its parent company which is not renewable energy registered.\n\nIn reply, please be informed, as follows:\n\n1. Input Taxes Paid on the Importation of Capital Equipment may be Recovered through Tax Credit or Refund.\n\nSection 108 (B) (7) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended by Republic Act (RA) No. 9337, and implemented by Section 4.108-5 (b) (7) of Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 16-2005, as amended, provide as follows:\n\n\"(b) Transactions Subject to Zero Percent (0%) VAT Rate. \u2014 The following services performed in the Philippines by VAT-registered persons shall be subject to zero percent (0%) VAT rate:\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(7) Sale of power or fuel generated through renewable sources of energy such as, but not limited to, biomass, solar, wind, hydropower, geothermal and steam, ocean energy, and other emerging sources using technologies such as fuel cells and hydrogen fuels; Provided, however, that zero-rating shall apply strictly to the sale of power or fuel generated through renewable sources of energy, and shall not extend to the sale of services related to the maintenance or operation of plants generating said power.\" AIDSTE\n\nThe afore-cited provisions of Section 108 (B) (7) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, and Section 4.108-5 (b) (7) of RR No. 16-2005, as amended, expressly state that the sale of power or fuel generated through renewable sources of energy is considered subject to VAT at zero percent (0%) rate. Thus, it is clear that SURE, being a Renewable Energy (RE) Developer, as endorsed by the Board of Investments and presumably registered and certified by the Department of Energy (DOE) is entitled to VAT zero rating on its sale of power or fuel generated through renewable sources of energy. (BIR Ruling No. 358-17 dated August 9, 2017)\n\nFurthermore, in view of the zero-rated sales of power or fuel by SURE, any input tax on its importation of capital equipment and local purchases of goods and services directly related or attributable to such zero-rated sales shall be available as tax credit or refund pursuant to Section 112 (A) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended by RA 9337, which provides:\n\n\"Sec. 112. Refunds or Tax Credits of Input Tax. \u2014\n\n(A) Zero-Rated or Effectively Zero-Rated Sales. \u2014 Any VAT-registered person, whose sales are zero-rated or effectively zero-rated may, within two (2) years after the close of the taxable quarter when the sales were made, apply for the issuance of a tax credit certificate or refund of creditable input tax due or paid attributable to such sales, except transitional input tax, to the extent that such input tax has not been applied against output tax: x x x.\"\n\nAnent the above, pertinent portion of Section 4.112-1 of RR No. 16-2005, as amended, provides that \u2014\n\n\"(a) Zero-rated and Effectively Zero-rated Sales of Goods, Properties or Services \u2014\n\nA VAT-registered person whose sales of goods, properties or services are zero-rated or effectively zero-rated may apply for the issuance of a tax credit certificate/refund of input tax attributable to such sales. The input tax that may be subject of the claim shall exclude the portion of input tax that has been applied against the output tax. The application should be filed within two (2) years after the close of the taxable quarter when such sales were made.\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\nWhere the taxpayer is engaged in both zero-rated or effectively zero-rated sales and in taxable (including sales subject to final withholding VAT) or exempt sales of goods, properties or services, and the amount of creditable input tax due or paid cannot be directly and entirely attributed to any one of the transactions, only the proportionate share of input taxes allocated to zero-rated or effectively zero-rated sales can be claimed for refund or issuance of a tax credit certificate.\"\n\nAccordingly, the input tax paid by SURE on its importation of capital equipment may be recovered by applying for the issuance of a tax credit certificate/refund of input taxes directly attributable to the sale of power or fuel generated through renewable sources of energy, which must be filed within two (2) years after the close of the taxable quarter when such sales were made. (BIR Ruling No. 078-10 dated September 23, 2010)\n\n2. There is no VAT exemption on the outsourced services and local procurement made by the parent company of SURE which is not an RE Developer as registered and certified by the DOE.\n\nSection 15 (g) of Republic Act (RA) No. 9513, otherwise known as \"Renewable Energy Act of 2008,\" provides that:\n\n\"SEC. 15.

Atienza\nPresident\n\nGentlemen :\n\nThis refers to your letters, both dated August 6, 2018, requesting for the exemption of Singapore School Manila, Inc. from the payment of Value-Added Tax (VAT) under Section 109 (H) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, and tax refund/tax credit.\n\nAs represented, Singapore School Manila, Inc. is a private educational institution duly accredited and recognized by the Department of Education (DepEd) under the following:\n\nRecognition/Government Permit No.\n\nDate Issued\n\nCourse/Track\n\nJuly 15, 2015\n\nNursery/Kindergarten\n\nJuly 15, 2015\n\nComplete Elementary\n\nNovember 5, 2012\n\nComplete Secondary\n\nApril 28, 2016\n\nArts and Design\n\nApril 28, 2016\n\nAcademic (Accountancy, Business and Management)\n\nIn reply, please be informed that Section 109 (H) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, provides:\n\n\"SEC. 109. Exempt Transactions. \u2014\n\n(1) Subject to the provisions of Subsection (2) hereof, the following transactions shall be exempt from the value-added tax.\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(H) Educational services rendered by private educational institutions, duly accredited by the Department of Education (DepEd), the Commission on Higher Education (CHED), the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA) and those rendered by government educational institutions.\"\n\nPursuant to Section 109 (H) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, gross receipts from the operations of educational institutions are exempt from the 12% VAT provided that it is accredited as such by the Department of Education, the Commission on Higher Education or the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority. ETHIDa\n\nThe VAT exemption provided under Section 109 (H) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, only pertains to the educational services rendered by private educational institutions but does not include VAT on their purchases of goods and services. Thus, while the school is exempt from VAT on its educational services, it cannot invoke the same exemption privilege to avoid paying VAT on its purchase of goods and/or services even if intended for school operational use because its exemption covers only taxes for which it is directly liable. It does not cover indirect tax such as VAT on its purchases of goods and services from VAT-registered suppliers. The 12% VAT for the purchase of goods and services may be shifted or passed on to the school by its VAT-registered suppliers. Once shifted, the VAT will form part of the cost of the goods and/or services supplied to the school. (VAT Ruling No. 017-02 dated March 20, 2002 and VAT Ruling No. 031-03 dated June 24, 2003).\n\nMoreover, the above exemption does not extend to the school's other activities involving its sale of goods and services not in connection with its primary purposes which are subject to the 12% VAT imposed under Sections 106 and 108 of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, or 3% percentage tax imposed under Section 116 in relation to Section 109 (V) of the same Code if the gross sales or receipts from such sale of goods and services do not exceed Three Million Pesos (P3,000,000.00) [1] which tax payment may legitimately be passed on to buyers of such goods and services. (BIR Ruling No. 169-2011 dated May 25, 2011)\n\nSince Singapore School Manila, Inc. is a private educational institution duly accredited by the Department of Education, this Office hereby holds that educational services rendered by Singapore School Manila, Inc. is exempt from the payment of VAT under Section 109 (H) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended.\n\nAs to the issue of tax refund/tax credit, an educational institution exempt from the payment of VAT is not entitled to apply for tax refund/tax credit of (excess) input tax. As discussed above, the 12% input VAT for the purchase of goods and services may be shifted or passed on to Singapore School Manila, Inc. by its VAT-registered suppliers. Once shifted, it shall form part of the cost of the goods and/or services purchased and shall be recorded by Singapore School Manila, Inc. as cost or expense.\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be ascertained that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R.

No. _________ dated November 29, 2012; and that as shown in its Articles of Incorporation, its primary purpose is to operate, engage, carry on the business of manufacturing of food products such as edible oil.\n\nIt is represented that BERRY FOODSOURCE, INC. was issued a Certificate of Registration on November 10, 2016 by the Bureau of Plant Industry under Registration Number ____________ valid until November 10, 2019 as an importer of dried raisins, dried pepper and roasted coffee powder.\n\nIn reply, please be informed that Section 109 (1) (A) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended by Republic Act No. 10963, provides for the exemption from VAT on the sale or importation of dried raisins. The aforesaid provision reads, viz.:\n\n\"SEC. 109. Exempt Transactions. \u2014 (1) Subject to the provisions of subsection (2) hereof, the following transactions shall be exempt from the value-added tax:\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\nA) Sale or importation of agricultural and marine food products in their original state, livestock and poultry of kind generally used as, or yielding or producing foods for human consumption; and breeding stock and genetic materials therefor.\n\n\"Products classified under this paragraph and paragraph (a) shall be considered in their original state even if they have undergone the simple processes of preparation or preservation for the market, such as freezing, drying, salting, broiling, roasting, smoking or stripping. Polished and/or husked rice, corn grits, raw cane sugar and molasses, and ordinary salt shall be considered in their original state.\" (Emphasis supplied) HEITAD\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\nBased on the above-cited provision, the importation and distribution/sale of agricultural products in their original state for human consumption, is considered exempt from 12% VAT pursuant to Section 109 (1) (A) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended. Agricultural products are considered remaining in their original state even if they have undergone the simple process of preparation or preservation for the market, such as freezing, drying, salting, broiling, roasting, or stripping. The type of processing is limited to the aforementioned simple processes. Otherwise, the same may no longer be considered agricultural product in its original state. Moreover, the VAT exemption is limited in application \u2014 it refers only to such products which are intended as food for human consumption.\n\nIn view of the foregoing, since dried raisin is basically an agricultural product in its original state and intended for human consumption, the importation and distribution/sale thereof by BERRY FOODSOURCE, INC. is exempt from the twelve percent (12%) VAT pursuant to Section 109 (1) (A) of the 1997 Tax Code, as amended. It is understood that the importation of such product shall be covered by valid and existing authority to import issued by the Bureau of Plant Industry.\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented.

The stockholders of BDO Capital, BDO Elite, and Banco De Oro Savings representing at least 2/3 of their outstanding capital stocks in their respective meetings held on July 22, 2015, also approved the said Plan of Merger.\n\nOn August 10, 2016, the SEC approved the Plan and Articles of Merger. Under the approved Plan and Articles of Merger, the merger shall become effective on the date when the Certificate of Merger shall have been issued and released by the SEC.\n\nAlso, pursuant to the Plan of Merger, BDO Capital will issue a total of 3,391,113 shares to the shareholders of BDO Elite, and a total of 3,609,286 shares to the shareholders of Banco De Oro Savings.\n\nThe authorized capital stock issued and outstanding capital stock of each of BDO Capital, BDO Elite, and Banco De Oro Savings as set forth in their respective Audited Financial Statements filed with the SEC together with the Articles of Merger and the Plan and Agreement of Merger, are as follows:\n\nBDO Capital\n\nType of Share\n\nAuthorized\n\nIssued and Outstanding\n\nPar Value\n\nNo. of Shares\n\nAmount\n\nCommon\n\n400,000,000.00\n\n300,000,000.00\n\n________\n\n3,000,000\n\n_______________\n\nPreferred\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\nBDO Elite\n\nType of Share\n\nAuthorized\n\nIssued and Outstanding\n\nPar Value\n\nNo. of Shares\n\nAmount\n\nCommon\n\n3,000,000,000.00\n\n2,424,714,300.00\n\n________\n\n24,247,143\n\n______________\n\nPreferred\n\n2,000,000,000.00\n\n-\n\n________\n\n-\n\n-\n\nBanco De Oro Savings\n\nType of Share\n\nAuthorized\n\nIssued and Outstanding\n\nPar Value\n\nNo. of Shares\n\nAmount\n\nCommon\n\n4,700,000,000.00\n\n4,184,457,000.00\n\n________\n\n83,689,140\n\n______________\n\nPreferred\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\nBeginning on the effective date of the merger and upon approval of its increase of authorized capital stock, the authorized capital stock and issued and outstanding capital stock of BDO Capital are as follows: DETACa\n\nBDO Capital\n\nType of Share\n\nAuthorized\n\nIssued and Outstanding\n\nPar Value\n\nNo. of Shares\n\nAmount\n\nCommon\n\n1,100,000,000.00\n\n1,000,039,900.00\n\n________\n\n10,000,399\n\n_____________\n\nPreferred\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\nBased on the foregoing representations, you now request for confirmation of the following:\n\n1. The statutory merger of BDO Capital, BDO Elite, and Banco De Oro Savings qualifies for non-recognition of gain or loss for income tax purposes in accordance with Sections 40 (C) (2) in relation to 40 (C) (6) (b) of the NIRC of 1997, as amended. Therefore, no gain or loss shall be recognized by BDO Capital, BDO Elite, and Banco De Oro Savings on the transfer of all assets and assumption of liabilities pursuant to the Articles and Plan of Merger, and BDO Capital, BDO Elite, and Banco De Oro Savings will not be subject to income tax, withholding tax, or capital gains tax on the transfer.\n\n2. The surrender by BDO Elite shareholders of their BDO Elite shares and the surrender by Banco De Oro Savings shareholders of their Banco De Oro Savings shares for cancellation pursuant to the merger is not subject to documentary stamp tax (DST).\n\nOn the other hand, DST at the rate of P1.00 on each P200 par value, or fractional part thereof, shall be imposed on the original issuance of BDO Capital shares in favor of the shareholders of BDO Elite and Banco De Oro Savings as a consequence of the merger.\n\n3. The transfer of assets by BDO Elite and Banco De Oro Savings to BDO Capital is not subject to donor's tax since there is no intention to donate on the part of BDO Elite and Banco De Oro Savings and that the merger was undertaken purely for legitimate business purposes.\n\n4. The transfer of assets by BDO Elite and Banco De Oro Savings to BDO Capital pursuant to the merger is not subject to value-added tax (VAT).\n\n5. Since the legal and beneficial ownership of excess creditable withholding taxes (CWT) were effectively transferred from BDO Elite and Banco De Oro Savings to BDO Capital as a consequence of the merger, BDO Capital as the surviving corporation is now entitled to exercise all the attributes of ownership over them. Hence, BDO Capital is entitled to carry forward and apply these excess creditable withholding taxes as credit against its Minimum Corporate Income Tax (MCIT) or regular corporate income tax liabilities.\n\n6. Any excess MCIT of Banco De Oro Savings and BDO Elite shall be transferred and vested in BDO Capital on the effective date of merger and BDO Capital may carry forward and credit the excess MCIT of Banco De Oro Savings and BDO Elite against its regular corporate income tax liabilities for the three immediately succeeding taxable years reckoned from the date of payment of the MCIT by Banco De Oro Savings and BDO Elite pursuant to Section 27 (E) (2) of the NIRC of 1997, as amended.\n\n7. The accumulated unutilized Net Operating Loss Carry Over (\"NOLCO\") of Banco De Oro Savings and BDO Elite as the absorbed corporations are preserved, transferred to and vested in BDO Capital, as the surviving corporation, and may be carried over and claimed by BDO Capital as a deduction from its gross income pursuant to Section 34 (D) (3) of the NIRC of 1997, as amended.\n\nIn reply thereto, please be informed as follows:\n\n1. The merger of BDO Capital, BDO Elite, and Banco De Oro Savings is a merger within the contemplation of Section 40 (C) (2), in relation to Section 40 (C) (6) (b) of the NIRC of 1997, as amended, because BDO Capital shall acquire/assume all the assets and liabilities of BDO Elite and Banco De Oro Savings and the same is necessary and advisable and is to the advantage and welfare of the merging corporations and their respective stockholders since the corporations own, hold, and manage various assets for the same beneficial owner. Hence, the merger of BDO Capital, BDO Elite, and Banco De Oro Savings is being undertaken for a bona fide business purpose and not for the purpose of escaping the burden of taxation. ATICcS\n\nThe merger of BDO Capital, BDO Elite, and Banco De Oro Savings qualifies for non-recognition of gain or loss for income tax purposes in accordance with Section 40 (C) (2) of the NIRC of 1997, as amended, and that no gain or loss shall be recognized by BDO Elite and Banco De Oro Savings, as the transferors of all assets and liabilities, to BDO Capital pursuant to the Articles and Plan of Merger.\n\nAccordingly, no gain or loss shall be recognized by BDO Capital, as the transferee, on its receipt of the assets and liabilities of BDO Elite and Banco De Oro Savings pursuant to and as a consequence of the merger.\n\nThe basis of the shares of stocks to be received by shareholders of BDO Elite and Banco De Oro Savings upon the exchange shall be the same as the basis of the properties, stocks or securities they exchanged, decreased by (1) the money they received, and (2) the fair market value of the other property/ies they received and increased by (a) the amount treated as dividend of the shareholders and (b) the amount of any gain that was recognized in the exchange. [1]\n\nThe basis of the property transferred in the hands of the transferee (BDO Capital) shall be the same as it would be in the hands of the transferors (BDO Elite and Banco De Oro Savings) increased by the amount of the gain, if any, recognized to the transferors on the transfer. [2]\n\nIf the amount of the liabilities assumed plus the amount of the liabilities to which the property is subject exceed the total of the adjusted basis of the property transferred pursuant to such exchange, then such excess shall be considered as a gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset or of property which is not a capital asset, as the case may be. [3] ETHIDa\n\nThe substituted basis of the properties transferred by BDO Elite and Banco De Oro Savings to BDO Capital should strictly comply with the rule that cash and other cash items will be excluded from the computation of the adjusted basis of the properties transferred for purposes of determining whether liabilities assumed and to which the property is subject do not exceed the adjusted basis of the property transferred, pursuant to No. IV (A) (2) of Revenue Memorandum Ruling (RMR) No. 2-2002 dated June 10, 2002.\n\nAccordingly, the allocated shares and the substituted basis of the properties transferred by BDO Elite shall be as follows:\n\nAssets\n\nAmount\n\nAllocated Liabilities\n\nAllocated Shares\n\nSubstituted Basis\n\nDue from other banks\n\n____________\n\n____________\n\n___________\n\n____________\n\nFinancial Assets at Fair Value through profit or loss\n\n____________\n\n____________\n\n___________\n\n____________\n\nAvailable-for-sale Investments \u2014 net\n\n____________\n\n____________\n\n___________\n\n____________\n\nReceivables\n\n____________\n\n____________\n\n___________\n\n____________\n\nOther Resources\n\n____________\n\n____________\n\n___________\n\n____________\n\nTotal\n\n____________\n\n____________\n\n___________\n\n____________\n\nLiabilities\n\nAmount\n\nAccrued Taxes and Other Expenses\n\n___________\n\nDue to Treasurer of the Philippines\n\n___________\n\nTotal\n\n___________\n\nWhereas, the allocated shares and the substituted basis of the properties transferred by Banco De Oro Savings shall be as follows:\n\nAssets\n\nAmount\n\nAllocated Liabilities\n\nAllocated Shares\n\nSubstituted Basis\n\nDue from Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas\n\n___________\n\n___________\n\n__________\n\n___________\n\nDue from other banks\n\n___________\n\n___________\n\n__________\n\n___________\n\nFinancial Assets at Fair Value through profit or loss\n\n___________\n\n___________\n\n__________\n\n___________\n\nAvailable-for-sale Financial Assets\n\n___________\n\n___________\n\n__________\n\n___________\n\nReceivables\n\n___________\n\n___________\n\n__________\n\n___________\n\nOther Resources\n\n___________\n\n___________\n\n__________\n\n___________\n\nTotal\n\n___________\n\n___________\n\n__________\n\n___________\n\nLiabilities\n\nAmount\n\nAccrued Expenses and Other Liabilities\n\n__________\n\n2. No DST is due on the surrender by BDO Elite shareholders of their BDO Elite shares and the surrender by Banco De Oro Savings shareholders of their Banco De Oro Savings shares for cancellation pursuant to the merger under Section 199 (m) of the NIRC of 1997, as amended by Republic Act (RA) No. 9243, in relation to Section 40 (C) (2) of the NIRC of 1997, as amended. TIADCc\n\nOn the other hand, pursuant to Section 174 of the NIRC of 1997, as amended, DST at the rate of P1.00 [4] on each P200 par value, or fractional part thereof, shall be imposed on the original issuance of shares by BDO Capital in favor of the shareholders of BDO Elite and Banco De Oro Savings as a consequence of the merger.\n\n3. Well-settled in our jurisprudence is the fact that the essential elements of a valid donation are: (1) the reduction of the patrimony of the donor; (2) the increase in the patrimony of the donee; and (3) the intent to do an act of liberality (animus donandi).\n\nClearly, there is no intention on the part of any of the parties to the merger \u2014 BDO Elite and Banco De Oro Savings to donate to BDO Capital their assets since the transaction is purely for a legitimate business purpose. Thus, the merger will not be subject to donor's tax since there is no intention to donate, and the transaction is a bona fide merger effected solely for business reasons.\n\n4. The transfer of assets/properties of BDO Elite and Banco De Oro Savings to BDO Capital as a consequence of the merger is not subject to VAT pursuant to Section 105 of the NIRC of 1997, as amended. The transfer of assets/properties to effectuate a merger is not made in the course of business but by operation of law pursuant to the merger.\n\nFurthermore, the assets/properties transferred by BDO Elite and Banco De Oro Savings to BDO Capital are mainly financial assets. These do not include goods or properties that are used in business, that are held for sale or for lease by the transferors, that are originally intended for sale or for use in the course of business, nor that are of any character or nature subject to VAT.\n\n5. The excess and unutilized CWT of the absorbed corporations, BDO Elite and Banco De Oro Savings, as of the effective date of the merger, which form part of the assets to be transferred by the absorbed corporations to BDO Capital as a consequence of the merger, may be applied as a tax credit by BDO Capital against its income tax due for the taxable year 2016, the effective date of the merger being August 10, 2016, and in the succeeding taxable years, or may be the subject of a claim for refund or issuance of a tax credit certificate (TCC).\n\n6. The excess and unexpired MCIT of the absorbed corporations, BDO Elite and Banco De Oro Savings, as of the effective date of the merger shall be carried forward and credited against the regular corporate income tax due of the surviving corporation, BDO Capital, for the three (3) immediately succeeding taxable years pursuant to Section 27 (E) (2) of the NIRC of 1997, as amended. Since the excess and unexpired MCIT of BDO Elite and Banco De Oro Savings are among the rights, privileges, property and/or interest of BDO Elite and Banco De Oro Savings, their excess and unexpired MCIT shall be transferred to and vested in BDO Capital on the effective date of the merger. Thus, BDO Elite and Banco De Oro Savings' excess and unexpired MCIT shall be carried forward and credited against the regular corporate income tax of BDO Capital subject to the three-year-carry-forward period reckoned from the date of payment of BDO Elite and Banco De Oro Savings of their MCIT.\n\n7. It is to be emphasized, however, that the NOLCO under Section 34 (D) (3) of the NIRC of 1997, as amended, and as implemented by Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 14-2001, of the absorbed corporations, BDO Elite and Banco De Oro Savings, if any, is not one of their assets that can be transferred and absorbed by the surviving corporation, BDO Capital, as this privilege or deduction can be availed of merely by the absorbed corporations. Accordingly, the tax-free merger does not cover the NOLCO of BDO Elite and Banco De Oro Savings that can be transferred and absorbed by BDO Capital. AIDSTE\n\nHowever, in order that the above-described reorganization can be considered as merger under Section 40 (C) (2) and (6) (b) of the NIRC of 1997, as amended, the parties to the merger should comply with the following requirements set forth under RR No. 18-2001:\n\nA. The plan of reorganization should be adopted by each of the corporations, parties thereto, the adoption being shown by the acts of its duly constituted responsible officers and appearing upon the official records of the corporation. Each corporation, which is a party to the reorganization, shall file, as part of its return for the taxable year within which the reorganization occurred a complete statement of all facts pertinent to the non-recognition of gain or loss in connection with the reorganization, including:\n\n1. A copy of the plan of reorganization, together with a statement executed under the penalties of perjury, showing in full the purposes thereof and in detail all transactions incident to, or pursuant to the plan;\n\n2. A complete statement of all cost or other basis of all property, including all stocks or securities, transferred incident to the plan;\n\n3. A statement of the amount of stock or securities and other property or money received from the exchange, including a statement of all distribution of other disposition made thereof. The amount of each kind of stock or securities and other property received shall be stated on the basis of the fair market value thereof at the date of the exchange;\n\n4. A statement of the amount and nature of any liabilities assumed upon the exchange, and the amount and nature of any liabilities to which any of the property acquired in the exchange is subject.\n\nB. Every taxpayer, other than a corporation, party to the reorganization, who received stock or securities and other property or money upon a tax-free exchange in connection with a corporate reorganization shall incorporate in his income tax return for the taxable year in which the exchange takes place a complete statement of all facts pertinent to the non-recognition of gain or loss upon such exchange, including:\n\n1. A statement of the cost or other basis of the stock or securities transferred in the exchange; and acEHCD\n\n2. A statement in full of the amount of stock or securities and other property or money received from the exchange, including any liabilities assumed upon the exchange, and any liabilities to which property received is subject. The amount of each kind of stock or securities and other property (other liabilities assumed upon the exchange) received shall be set forth upon the basis of the fair market value thereof at the date of the exchange.\n\nC. Records in substantial form shall be kept by every taxpayer who participates in a tax-free exchange in connection with a corporate reorganization showing the cost or other basis of the transferred property or money received (including any liabilities assumed on the exchange, or any liabilities to which any of the properties received were subject), in order to facilitate the determination of gain or loss from subsequent disposition of such stock or securities and other property received from the exchange.\n\nIn addition to the foregoing requirements, the parties shall enclose with their respective income tax returns for the taxable year in which the tax-free exchange occurred a copy of the request for ruling filed with, and the corresponding ruling issued by the Bureau of Internal Revenue, both duly stamped received by the appropriate office of the Bureau of Internal Revenue. Such persons shall include as a note to their respective audited financial statements for the taxable year in which the exchange occurred a statement to the effect that they hold such assets/shares acquired in a tax-free exchange and the year in which such exchange occurred, and in the taxable years until the subject properties are subsequently transferred to another transferee. EcTCAD\n\nMoreover, the shareholders of the absorbed/dissolving corporation/s and the surviving/transferee corporation shall record in their respective books the mandatory accounting entries stated in Annex \"A\" hereof, pursuant to Revenue Memorandum Order (RMO) No. 17-2016.\n\nFurthermore, the parties shall cause to annotate at the back of the Transfer Certificates of Title (TCT) and Certificates of Stock, the date the merger was executed, the original or historical cost of acquisition of the properties or shares of stock involved, and the fact that no gain or loss was recognized as a result of such merger; provided however, that any violation by the Register of Deeds or by the Corporate Secretary of this condition shall be penalized under Section 269 or 275, as the case may be, of the NIRC of 1997, as amended.\n\nFinally, it is required that within ninety (90) days from receipt of this ruling, the parties to the transaction must submit to the Law and Legislative Division, Bureau of Internal Revenue, certified true copies by the Corporate Secretary, of duly annotated Certificates of Stock, in respect of the shares of stock of the transferee corporation, including the revised allocation of shares and re-computation of the substituted bases of the properties which shall be in accordance with RMR No. 2-2002.\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be disclosed that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R. DULAY\nCommissioner of Internal Revenue",

Other percentage taxes under Title V of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended;\n\n7. Excise taxes directly payable in connection with the sale of invention products; and\n\n8.

No. _______ dated January 13, 2017; and that as shown in its Articles of Incorporation, its primary purpose is to own, manage and operate diagnostic facility provided that such services shall be done by duly licensed and qualified personnel.\n\nIt is represented that the services being offered by OPTICARE DIAGNOSTIC LAB, INC. are purely medical and laboratory services only; that it is also registered with the Department of Health (DOH) and was issued the necessary License to Operate a Hematology, Clinical Microscopy, Clinical Chemistry and Serology (w/HIV Test).\n\nIn reply, please be informed that Section 109 (G) of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended, provides:\n\n\"SEC. 109. Exempt transactions. \u2014 (1) Subject to the provisions of Subsection (2) hereof, the following transactions shall be exempt from the value-added tax:\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(G) Medical, dental, hospital and veterinary services except those rendered by professionals;\n\nxxx xxx xxx.\"\n\nIn relation thereto, Revenue Regulations No. 16-2005 provides:\n\n\"Section 4.109-1. VAT-Exempt Transactions. \u2014\n\n(A) In general. \u2014 \"VAT-exempt transactions\" refer to the sale of goods or properties and/or services and the use or lease of properties that is not subject to VAT (output tax) and the seller is not allowed any tax credit of VAT (input tax) on purchases.\n\nThe person making the exempt sale of goods, properties or services shall not bill any output tax to his customers because the said transaction is not subject to VAT. CAIHTE\n\n(B) Exempt transaction. \u2014\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(g) Medical, dental, hospital and veterinary services, except those rendered by professionals.\n\nLaboratory services are exempted. If the hospital or clinic operates a pharmacy or drug store, the sale of drugs and medicines is subject to VAT. (Emphasis ours)\n\nxxx xxx xxx.\"\n\nBased on the expressed provisions of the foregoing, it is clear that laboratory services are considered transactions exempt from VAT. Applying it to the instant case, insofar as the rendition of laboratory services by OPTICARE DIAGNOSTIC LAB, INC. is concerned, this Office hereby confirms that this is considered exempt from VAT. As service provider, OPTICARE DIAGNOSTIC LAB, INC. shall not pass on the VAT to its clients because said transactions is not subject to VAT.\n\nHowever, in relation to the conduct of diagnostic services, whether such is also exempt from VAT shall depend on how it is provided. The process of diagnosis is defined as the discovery of the source of a patient's illness or the determination of the nature of his disease from a study of its symptoms. [1] The conduct of diagnostic service may either be carried out by an employee of OPTICARE DIAGNOSTIC LAB, INC. or by an independent professional (consultants).\n\nWhen conducted by the employees of OPTICARE DIAGNOSTIC LAB, INC., the process of diagnosis shall form part of the medical/laboratory services and the service fee, as payment for both diagnostic and laboratory services as a package, is VAT-exempt by express provision of Section 109 (G) of the Tax Code as implemented by Revenue Regulations No. 16-2005. On the other hand, diagnostic services, when rendered by an independent professional (consultant), shall appropriately be subject to VAT in the hands of the one who performs it but Opticare Diagnostic Lab, Inc. cannot claim it as input tax credit. (Sec. 109 (G) supra). Thus, the independent professional who conducted the diagnostic service must issue his/her own official receipts for the payment of fees therefor.\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be disclosed that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R.

Karla Grace J. Deles-Geli\nTreasurer\n\nMadam :\n\nThis refers to your letter, dated January 10, 2018, applying on behalf of NETHERLANDS SHIPPING TRAINING CENTER FOUNDATION, INC. for tax exemption certificate being enjoyed by non-stock, non-profit corporation or association under Section 30 (H) of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) of 1997, as amended.\n\nIt is represented that NETHERLANDS SHIPPING TRAINING CENTER FOUNDATION, INC. with BIR Taxpayer's Identification No. (TIN) __________ and Certificate of Registration No. __________ dated July 09, 2008, is a non-stock, non-profit organization duly organized and existing under the laws of the Republic of the Philippines; that it is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under Company Registration No. __________ and that the purposes for which the association was incorporated are:\n\n1. To update/upgrade the technical qualification of seafarers through advance and specialized maritime training courses;\n\n2. To receive fees, donations, contributions or endowments, in cash or in kind from members, students and/or other persons or entities in the maritime sector of the Philippines or abroad, and to receive such property or money as may from time to time be acquired by deed, grant, devise, bequest, gift, and the like;\n\n3. To conduct course and other activities as well as research in the maritime business and technology and to form and organize training courses in order to upgrade the qualifications of seafarers in accordance with international and Filipino standards;\n\n4. To purchase, acquire, hold, sell, lease, exchange, mortgage or otherwise deal in real estate and/or personal property and to build, lease, mortgage land, buildings and offices;\n\n5. To employ personnel on regular and/or temporary basis as the case may be, as may be necessary or useful to carry out the objects and purposes of the Foundation;\n\n6. To organize, operate and maintain dormitories, classrooms, laboratories, printing and publishing facilities and maritime projects; and\n\n7. Other activities related to the career path of seafarers.\n\nIn reply, please be informed that Section 30 of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended, enumerates the non-stock and/or non-profit corporations/associations/organizations that are exempt from income tax in respect to income received by them as such. Section 30 (H) of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended, provides, viz.:\n\n\"Sec. 30. Exemptions from Tax on Corporations. \u2014 The following organizations shall not be taxed under this Title in respect to income received by them as such:\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(H) A nonstock and nonprofit educational institution;\"\n\nxxx xxx xxx\"\n\n\"Non-stock\" means \"no part of its income is distributable as dividends to its members, trustees, or officers\" and that any profit \"obtained as an incident to its operations shall, whenever necessary or proper, be used for the furtherance of the purpose or purposes for which the corporation was organized.\" [1] \"Non-profit\" means that \"no net income or asset accrues to or benefits any member or specific person, with all the net income or assets devoted to the institution's purposes and all its activities conducted not for profit.\" [2]\n\nRevenue Memorandum Circular (RMC) No. 64-2016, has clarified that in order for an entity to qualify as a non-stock and/or non-profit educational institution exempt from income tax under Section 30 (H) of the NIRC of 1997, as amended, it must have the following characteristics:\n\n1. It is organized as a non-stock, non-profit corporation;\n\n2. It is purposely organized as an educational institution;\n\n3. It is registered or recognized by the Department of Education (DepEd), Commission on Higher Education (CHED), or Technical Education and Skills Development Authority, and\n\n4. It has no net earnings or assets inuring to the benefit of any member, organizer, officer or any specific person.\n\nThe corporation must be purposely established as an educational institution to offer educational courses or programs. The corporation must operate as a primary or secondary school, a college, or a professional or trade school that has scheduled curriculum, a regular faculty, and enrolled student body in attendance in a place where the educational activities are regularly carried on.\n\nUnder the above quoted provisions, one of the requirements for an educational institution to be exempt from income tax pursuant to the provisions of paragraph 3, Section 4, Article XIV of the 1987 Constitution, in relation to Section 30 (H) of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended, and RMC No. 64-2016, is to be registered/accredited or recognized by the Department of Education (DepEd), Commission on Higher Education (CHED), or Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA). However, in the instant case, the submitted documents of NETHERLANDS SHIPPING TRAINING CENTER FOUNDATION, INC. failed to show that it is an educational institution registered/accredited/recognized by the Department of Education (DepEd), Commission on Higher Education (CHED), or Technical Education and Skills Development Authority.\n\nMoreover, the Audited Financial Statements of NETHERLANDS SHIPPING TRAINING CENTER FOUNDATION, INC., show that the primary source of its revenues come from training fees, lease and meal & laundry service fees. Such proceeds are being used exclusively for its perpetuation. It appears that this activity is being carried on by NETHERLANDS SHIPPING TRAINING CENTER FOUNDATION, INC. in a manner similar to organizations operated for profit. Thus, it is organized and operated principally for profit.\n\nPlease bear in mind that, \"being a non-stock and/or non-profit corporation does not, by this reason alone, completely exempt an institution from tax.\" [3] Thus, \"statutes granting tax exemptions are construed strictissimi juris against the taxpayer and liberally in favor of the taxing authority. A claim of tax exemption must be clearly shown and based on language in law too plain to be mistaken. Otherwise stated, taxation is the rule, exemption is the exception. The burden of proof rests upon the party claiming the exemption to prove that it is in fact covered by the exemption so claimed.\" [4] (BIR Ruling No. 466-2014 dated November 19, 2014)\n\nIN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, this Office is of the opinion that NETHERLANDS SHIPPING TRAINING CENTER FOUNDATION, INC. does not qualify for exemption under Section 30 (H) of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended. Therefore, NETHERLANDS SHIPPING TRAINING CENTER FOUNDATION, INC. shall be treated as an ordinary corporation subject to thirty percent (30%) income tax rate pursuant to Section 27 (A) and other internal revenue taxes imposed by the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.)

Gamata\nAdministrator\n\nGentlemen :\n\nThis refers to your letter dated June 5, 2018, applying on behalf of BMS CHRISTIAN INSTITUTE, INC. for the issuance of a certificate of tax exemption enjoyed by a non-stock, non-profit corporation or association organized and operated exclusively for educational purposes under Section 30 (H) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended.\n\nIt is represented that BMS CHRISTIAN INSTITUTE, INC. with BIR Taxpayer's Identification No. (TIN) __________ and Certificate of Registration No. __________ dated April 28, 2015, is a non-stock, non-profit association duly organized and existing under the laws of the Republic of the Philippines; that it is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under Company Registration No. __________; and that the primary purpose [1] for which the association was incorporated is to establish and operate an educational institution or learning center which shall provide courses of study in Pre-Elementary and Elementary Level subject to the laws of the Philippines; and that it was granted Government Permit (R-02) No. __________ on March 27, 2018.\n\nIn reply, please be informed that paragraph 3, Section 4, Article XIV of the 1987 Constitution states that:\n\n\"All revenues and assets of non-stock, non-profit educational institutions used actually, directly, and exclusively for educational purposes shall be exempt from taxes and duties.\"\n\nSimilarly, Section 30 (H) of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) of 1997, as amended, provides, viz.:\n\n\"Sec. 30. Exemptions from Tax on Corporations. \u2014 The following organizations shall not be taxed under this Title in respect to income received by them as such:\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(H) A non-stock and non-profit educational institution; x x x.\"\n\nMoreover, there are two requisites in order for a non-stock, non-profit educational institution to be exempt from tax as provided under Revenue Memorandum Order (RMO) No. 44-2016; to wit:\n\na) It is a non-stock, non-profit educational institution; and\n\nb) Its revenues are actually, directly and exclusively used for educational purposes.\n\n\"Non-stock\" means \"no part of its income is distributable as dividends to its members, trustees, or officers\" and that any profit \"obtained as an incident to its operations shall, whenever necessary or proper, be used for the furtherance of the purpose or purposes for which the corporation was organized.\" [2] \"Non-profit\" means that \"no net income or asset accrues to or benefits any member or specific person, with all the net income or assets devoted to the institution's purposes and all its activities conducted not for profit.\" [3]\n\nIn the submitted documents of BMS CHRISTIAN INSTITUTE, INC., it was disclosed that the Board of Trustees and Officers are entitled to allowances. The Treasurer's Affidavit/Certification states that:\n\n\"2. That as such, I hereby that the trustees, officers and faculty members serve in missionary capacity only and are given only minimal allowances to defray their transportation and necessities as the circumstances call.\"\n\nThe giving of allowances to the members of the Board of Trustees is considered as distribution of equity (including the net income) of BMS CHRISTIAN INSTITUTE, INC. This is a form of private inurement which the law prohibits in the organization and operation of a non-stock, non-profit corporation. This act violates the requirement that no part of the net income or assets of the corporation shall inure to the benefit of any individual or specific person. Thus, BMS CHRISTIAN INSTITUTE, INC. cannot be qualified as a non-stock, non-profit educational institution under Section 30 (H) of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended.\n\nPlease bear in mind that, \"being a non-stock and/or non-profit corporation does not, by this reason alone, completely exempt an institution from tax.\" [4] Thus, \"statutes granting tax exemptions are construed strictissimi juris against the taxpayer and liberally in favor of the taxing authority.

Therefore, BMS CHRISTIAN INSTITUTE, INC. shall be treated as an ordinary corporation subject to thirty percent (30%) income tax rate pursuant to Section 27 (A) and other internal revenue taxes imposed by the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended.\n\nPlease be guided accordingly.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.)

He recommended to reduce the useful life of the subject assets in accordance with the following schedule:\n\nAssets\n\nCurrent Useful Life\n\nProposed Useful Life\n\n1. Jetty Facility\n\n30 years\n\n15 years\n\n2. Storage Tanks\n\n20 years\n\n15 years\n\nThe recommendation by BBB was predicated on several factors namely:\n\n1. Impact of climate change on the coastal infrastructure;\n\n2. Delayed periodic maintenance due to safety concerns; and\n\n3. Issuance of an Annual Probationary Miscellaneous Lease from DENR limiting the duration of operation.\n\nBBB's Assessment Report was approved by SBTI's Board of Directors which authorized the shortening of the estimated useful lives of the subject assets during its meeting held last July 23, 2019. AScHCD\n\nIn reply, please be informed that Section 34 (F) (1) of the NIRC provides that there shall be allowed as a depreciation deduction a reasonable allowance for the exhaustion, wear and tear (including reasonable allowance for obsolescence) of property used in the trade or business.\n\nThe term \"reasonable allowance\" shall include, but not limited to, an allowance computed in accordance with rules and regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Finance, upon recommendation of the Commissioner, under any of the following methods:\n\na. The straight-line method;\n\nb. Declining-balance method, using a rate not exceeding twice the rate which would have been used had the annual allowance been computed under the method described in Subsection (F) (1);\n\nc. The sum-of-the-years-digit method; and\n\nd. Any other method which may be prescribed by the Secretary of Finance upon recommendation of the Commissioner. (Sec. 34 (F) (2), NIRC)\n\nCorollarily, Section 34 (F) (3) of the NIRC, as amended, provides that \u2014\n\n\"(3) Agreement as to Useful Life on which Depreciation Rate is Based. \u2014 Where under rules and regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Finance, upon recommendation of the Commissioner, the taxpayer and the Commissioner have entered into an agreement in writing specifically dealing with the useful life and rate of depreciation of any property, the rate so agreed upon shall be binding on both the taxpayer and the National Government in the absence of facts and circumstances not taken into consideration during the adoption of such agreement. The responsibility of establishing the existence of such facts and circumstances shall rest with the party initiating the modification. Any change in the agreed rate and useful life of the depreciable property as specified in the agreement shall not be effective for taxable years prior to the taxable year in which notice in writing by certified mail or registered mail is served by the party initiating such change to the other party to the agreement.\n\nProvided, however, That where the taxpayer has adopted such useful life and depreciation rate for any depreciable asset and claimed the depreciation expenses as deduction from his gross income, without any written objection on the part of the Commissioner or his duly authorized representative, the aforesaid useful life and depreciation rate so adopted by the taxpayer for the aforesaid depreciable asset shall be considered binding for purposes of this Subsection.\"\n\nMoreover, Section 105 of Revenue Regulations No. 2, otherwise known as the \"Income Tax Regulations\" reads \u2014\n\n\"Section 105. Depreciation. \u2014 A reasonable allowance for the exhaustion, wear and tear, and obsolescence of property used in the trade or business may be deducted from gross income. For convenience, such an allowance will usually be referred to as depreciation, excluding from the term any idea of a mere reduction in market value not resulting from exhaustion, wear and tear, or obsolescence. The proper allowance for such depreciation of any property used in the trade or business is that amount which should be set aside for the taxable year in accordance with a reasonable consistent plan whereby the aggregate of the amount so set aside, plus the salvage value, will, at the end of the useful life of the property in business, equal the basis of the property. Due regard must also be given to expenditures for current upkeep.\"\n\nFurthermore, Section 109 of said Regulations No. 2 likewise reads \u2014\n\n\"Section 109. Method of computing depreciation allowance. \u2014 The capital sum to be replaced should be charged off over the useful life of the property, either in equal instalment or in accordance with any other recognized trade practices, such as an apportionment of the capital sum over units of production. Whatever plan or method of apportionment is adopted must be reasonable and must have due regard to operating conditions during the taxable period. While the burden of proof must rest upon the taxpayer to sustain the deductions taken by him, such deductions must not be disallowed unless shown by clear and convincing evidence to be unreasonable. The reasonableness of any claim for depreciation shall be determined upon the conditions known to exist at the end of the period for which the return is made. If it develops that the useful life of the property will be longer or shorter than useful life as originally estimated under all the then known facts, the portion of the cost of other basis of the property not already provided for through depreciation allowances should be spread over the remaining useful life of the property as re-estimated in the light of the subsequent facts, and depreciation deductions taken accordingly.\" AcICHD\n\nBased on the foregoing, the taxpayer and the Commissioner may agree on the estimated useful life and rate of depreciation of any property. The rate so agreed upon shall be binding on both the taxpayer and the BIR. However, if it develops that the useful life of the property originally estimated under previous factual conditions is no longer reasonable, the law allows the taxpayer to lengthen or shorten the useful life of the property in the light of prevailing factual considerations.\n\nIt has been ruled that the remaining estimated useful life of the assets is determined as that period of time expressed in years that an asset is expected to perform, in a satisfactory manner, the function for which it was designed and built, assuming normal and reasonable maintenance. The estimates of remaining life for each item of property had been based, in a very large measure, upon the observed condition at the time of appraisal and condition of maintenance, and the consideration of normal rates of depreciation for the type of property.\n\nIn view of the foregoing, this Office hereby CONFIRMS the proposed change by SBTI in useful life of Subject Assets in claiming depreciation deduction, for both tax and financial accounting purposes, beginning January 1, 2020, provided, however, that any prior period adjustments shall be subject to deficiency income tax, interest and penalties, if warranted.\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be ascertained that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R. DULAY\nCommissioner of Internal Revenue",

Ltd. (\"Arisaig\" for brevity), for confirmation that the dividends received by Arisaig from its investments in Jollibee Foods Corporation (\"Jollibee\" for brevity) are subject to the fifteen percent (15%) tax rate pursuant to Section 28 (B) (5) (b) of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended.\n\nBackground:\n\nJollibee is a domestic corporation duly organized and existing under the Philippine laws and with office address at 10th Floor, Jollibee Plaza Building, No. 10 Emerald Avenue, Ortigas Centre, Pasig City. It is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under Registration No. 77487 to engage in and carry on restaurant business.\n\nOn the other hand, Arisaig is a private company limited duly organized and existing under the laws of Singapore with address at 7A Lorong Telok, Singapore 049020. It has no fixed place of business in the Philippines and is not registered as a corporation or as a partnership in the Philippines, as confirmed by the SEC in its Certification dated April 23, 2014. CAIHTE\n\nArisaig has shareholdings in the Philippines from which it receives dividends from its investments. It holds 3,841,980 shares of Jollibee as of May 08, 2014.\n\nOn July 31, 2012, Arisaig applied for a tax exemption scheme for Resident Funds pursuant to Section 13 (R) of the Singapore Income Tax Act (\"SITA\"). On August 27, 2012, Arisaig was issued a Letter of Approval by the Monetary Authority of Singapore approving the tax exemption scheme for the period commencing from July 31, 2012.\n\nOn April 07, 2014, the Board of Directors of Jollibee approved the declaration of a cash dividend in the amount of ___________ (P_____) per share from its unrestricted retained earnings as of 2008-2009, to all stockholders of record as of May 08, 2014 and payable on May 30, 2014.\n\nIn view thereof, Arisaig would like to confirm whether or not the dividends to be received from Jollibee are subject to the fifteen percent (15%) tax rate pursuant to Section 28 (B) (5) (b) of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended.\n\nIn reply, please be informed that Section 28 (B) (5) (b) of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended, provides as follows: aScITE\n\n\"SEC. 28. Rates of Income Tax on Foreign Corporations. \u2014\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(B) Tax on Nonresident Foreign Corporation. \u2014\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(5) Tax on Certain Incomes Received by a Nonresident Foreign Corporation. \u2014\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(b) Intercorporate Dividends. \u2014 A final withholding tax at the rate of fifteen percent (15%) is hereby imposed on the amount of cash and/or property dividends received from a domestic corporation, which shall be collected and paid as provided in Section 57(A) of this Code, subject to the condition that the country in which the nonresident foreign corporation is domiciled, shall allow a credit against the tax due from the nonresident foreign corporation taxes deemed to have been paid in the Philippines equivalent to twenty percent (20%), which represents the difference between the regular income tax of thirty-five percent (35%) and the fifteen percent (15%) tax on dividends as provided in this subparagraph: Provided, That effective January 1, 2009, the credit against the tax due shall be equivalent to fifteen percent (15%), which represents the difference between the regular income tax of thirty percent (30%) and the fifteen percent (15%) tax on dividends;\" (Emphasis provided)\n\nUnder the afore-quoted provision, the dividends to be paid by Jollibee to Arisaig are subject to fifteen percent (15%) Philippine income tax if Arisaig's country of domicile, Singapore, shall allow Arisaig a fifteen percent (15%) deemed paid tax credit against its income tax due on such dividends in Singapore. It is noted that Section 13 (8) of Singapore Income Tax Act (\"SITA\") provides as follows:\n\n\"(8) Where the conditions specified in subsection (9) are satisfied, there shall be exempt from tax \u2014\n\n(a) Any dividend derived from any territory outside Singapore;\n\n(b) Any profit derived from any trade or business carried on by a branch in any territory outside Singapore of a company resident in Singapore; and\n\n(c) Any income derived from any professional, consultancy and other services rendered in any territory outside Singapore only if the Comptroller is satisfied that the income is derived, for the purposes of this Act, from outside Singapore,\n\nand received in Singapore \u2014\n\ni) On or after 1st of June 2003 by any person, not being an individual resident in Singapore;\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(9) The conditions referred to in subsection (8) are \u2014\n\n(a) the income is subject to tax of a similar character to income tax (by whatever name called) under the law of the territory from which the income is received;\n\n(b) at the time the income is received in Singapore by the person resident in Singapore, the highest rate of tax of a similar character to income tax (by whatever name called) levied under the law of the territory from which the income is received on any gains or profits from any trade or business carried on by any company in that territory at that time is not less than 15%; and\n\n(c) the Comptroller is satisfied that the tax exemption would be beneficial to the person resident in Singapore.\" (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)\n\nApplying the above-cited provisions, in relation to Section 28 (B) (5) (b) of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended, it is clear that the cash dividends declared by Jollibee's Board of Directors on April 07, 2014 will not be taxable in Singapore on the part of Arisaig. DETACa\n\nIt is worthy to mention that the Supreme Court, in the case of Commissioner of Internal Revenue vs. Wander Philippines, Inc., [1] has ruled that exemption from taxes by the country of domicile of the non-resident corporate stockholder on dividends received, is sufficient basis for the applicability of the fifteen percent (15%) tax rate. Thus:\n\n\"While it may be true that claims for refund are construed strictly against the claimant, nevertheless, the fact that Switzerland did not impose any tax on the dividends received by Glaxo from the Philippines should be considered as a full satisfaction of the given condition. For, as aptly stated by respondent court, to deny private respondent the privilege to withhold only 15% tax provided for under Presidential Decree No. 369 amending Section 24 (b)(1) of the Tax Code, would run counter to the very spirit and intent of said law and definitely will adversely affect foreign corporation's interest here and discourage them from investing capital in our country.\"\n\nThe above ruling was reiterated in the case of Caltex (Philippines), Inc. vs. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, [2] wherein it was held that the dividends remitted by a domestic corporation to a resident of Bermuda is subject to fifteen percent (15%) withholding tax in as much as Bermuda does not impose any tax on dividends received by corporations domiciled therein, pursuant to the Exempted Undertaking Tax Protection Act of 1966.\n\nIn view of the foregoing, this Office hereby confirms your opinion that dividends declared by Jollibee on April 07, 2014 shall be subject to the preferential withholding tax rate of fifteen percent (15%) on the part of Arisaig pursuant to Section 28 (B) (5) (b) of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended, considering that under the SITA, dividends derived by Arisaig from sources outside Singapore, are exempt from Singapore income tax. (BIR Ruling No. 069-2013 dated February 18, 2013)\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation it will be disclosed that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void. HEITAD\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R.

To construct, manage, maintain and operate adequate facilities and services for its members;\n\n2. To initiate and organize socio-cultural projects and activities to awaken community consciousness and belonging;\n\n3. To promote, enhance and foster the development and improvement of the quality of life of the members through livelihood projects and other economic activities;\n\n4. To acquire, accept donations, purchase, own, hold, develop, lease, mortgage, pledge, exchange, sell, transfer or otherwise invest, deal in or trade, in any manner permitted by law and the rules and regulations of government regulatory or licensing agencies, real and personal properties to every kind and description, or any interest therein, as may be necessary for the accomplishment of the purposes of the association.\n\n5.

Those services, such as garbage collection and disposal, cleaning of streets, and other similar services, redound to the benefit of your homeowners. By this reason, we cannot issue a Certification stating the City's lack of resources to render basic services to your community.\"\n\nTHE BELLEFONTE COMMUNITY HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION, INC. bases its claim for tax exemption on Section 18 of R.A. No. 9904, which provides:\n\n\"SECTION 18. Relationship with LGUs. \u2014 Homeowners' associations shall complement, support and strengthen LGUs in providing vital services to their members and help implement local government policies, programs, ordinances, and rules.\n\nAssociations are encouraged to actively cooperate with LGUs in furtherance of their common goals and activities for the benefit of the residents of the subdivisions/villages and their environments.\n\nWhere the LGUs lack resources to provide for basic services, the associations shall endeavor to tap the means to provide for the same. In recognition of the associations' efforts to assist the LGUs in providing such basic services, association dues and income derived from rentals of their facilities shall be tax-exempt: Provided, That such income and dues shall be used for the cleanliness, safety, security and other basic services needed by the members, including the maintenance of the facilities of their respective subdivisions or villages. x x x\"\n\nIn reply thereto, we regret to inform you that THE BELLEFONTE COMMUNITY HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION, INC. does not fall within the purview of those homeowners' associations which may be exempted under Section 18 of RA No. 9904. Since the requisite qualification that the city or municipality concerned lacks resources to provide for basic services is absent from the letter issued by the Office of the City Administrator, your request cannot be granted for lack of factual and legal basis. (BIR Ruling No. 399-2013 dated November 7, 2013)\n\nConsequently, THE BELLEFONTE COMMUNITY HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION, INC., shall be subject to the applicable internal revenue taxes on its income from association dues, rentals of its facilities, trade business and other activities. Specifically:\n\nIncome Tax\n\nIt shall be subject to the corresponding internal revenue taxes imposed under the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended, on its income derived from association dues and rentals of its facilities, which income should be returned for taxation. Likewise, interest income from currency bank deposits and yield or any other monetary benefit from deposit substitute instruments and from trust funds and similar arrangements, and royalties derived from sources within the Philippines are subject to the 20% final withholding tax; provided, however, that interest income derived from it from a depository bank under the expanded foreign currency deposit system shall be subject to 15% [1] final withholding tax pursuant to Section 27 (D) (1) in relation to Section 57 (A), both of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended. Moreover, it is required to file on or before April 15 of each year a profit and loss statement and balance sheet with the annual information return under oath, stating its gross income and expenses incurred during the year and a certificate showing that there has not been any change in its By-Laws, Articles of Incorporation, manner of operation and activities as well as resources and disposition of income.\n\nValue-Added Tax or Percentage Tax\n\nLikewise, THE BELLEFONTE COMMUNITY HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION, INC.'s gross receipts from rentals of its facilities and gross receipts from operations not derived from association dues, membership fees, other assessments and charges collected in a purely reimbursement basis, shall be subject to the 12% VAT as imposed under Section 108 of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, which tax payment may legitimately be passed on to buyers of such goods and services; or 3% percentage tax imposed under Section 116 in relation to Section 109 (BB) of the same Code if the gross sales or receipts from such sale of goods and services do not exceed Three Million Pesos (P3,000,000.00). [2]\n\nIt should be understood that THE BELLEFONTE COMMUNITY HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION, INC. shall be constituted as withholding agent of the government if it acts as an employer and its employees receive compensation income subject to the withholding tax under Section 57 of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended.\n\nFinally, THE BELLEFONTE COMMUNITY HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION, INC. is also subject to the payment of the annual registration fee of PhP500.00 as prescribed in Section 236 (B) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended. It is also required under Section 6 (C) in relation to Section 237 of the same Code to issue duly registered receipts for services rendered which do not comprise income from association dues and rentals of their facilities.\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented.

To do and perform any other acts and things, and to have and exercise any other powers which may be necessary, convenient and appropriate to accomplish the purposes for which the Association is organized.\n\nand that the City Planning and Development Office, through Ms. Rowena T. Zapanta, issued a Certificate dated April 7, 2017, stating that:\n\n\"This is to certify that Town & Country Executive Village Homeowners Association, Inc., located in Brgy. Mayamot, Antipolo City is a homeowner's association registered with the Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board (HLURB), with Registration No. __________ dated 14 November 2013, and provides the services for the cleanliness, safety, security and other basic services including maintenance for the common facilities needed by the members and/or association that fall within the purview of the \"basic services community services and facilities,\" defined under Section 3 (d) of RA No. 9904 otherwise known as the Magna Carta for Homeowners and Homeowners' Association, as those referring to services and facilities that redound to the benefits of all homeowners, which complement the needed funds by the City Government of Antipolo in providing vital services to their members and help in the implementation of local government policies, programs, ordinances, and rules.\n\nThis certification is being issued upon the request of Town & Country Executive Village Homeowners Association relative to its application for a tax exemption, pursuant to Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) Revenue Memorandum Circular (RMC) No. 9-2013, dated 29 January 2013, granting tax exemption for homeowner's association.\"\n\nThe Office of the City Mayor of Antipolo on April 25, 2017 further certified that:\n\n\"As such and subject to fund availability, the homeowners' association has been providing the basic services and facilities that redound to the benefit of all homeowners foremost of which is providing security services, street and vicinity lights, maintenance, repairs and cleaning of the streets in the subdivision, garbage collection and disposal and other similar services and facilities.\n\nHowever, the homeowners' association lacks sufficient resources to fully provide such basic services notwithstanding its clear mandate under applicable laws, rules and regulations.\"\n\nTOWN & COUNTRY EXECUTIVE VILLAGE HOMEOWNERS' ASSOCIATION, INC. bases its claim for tax exemption on Section 18 of R.A. No. 9904, which provides;\n\n\"SECTION 18. Relationship with LGUs. \u2014 Homeowners' associations shall complement, support and strengthen LGUs in providing vital services to their members and help implement local government policies, programs, ordinances, and rules.\n\nAssociations are encouraged to actively cooperate with LGUs in furtherance of their common goals and activities for the benefit of the residents of the subdivisions/villages and their environments.\n\nWhere the LGUs lack resources to provide for basic services, the associations shall endeavor to tap the means to provide for the same. In recognition of the associations' efforts to assist the LGUs in providing such basic services, association dues and income derived from rentals of their facilities shall be tax-exempt: Provided, that such income and dues shall be used for the cleanliness, safety, security and other basic services needed by the members, including the maintenance of the facilities of their respective subdivisions or villages. x x x\"\n\nIn reply thereto, we regret to inform you that TOWN & COUNTRY EXECUTIVE VILLAGE HOMEOWNERS' ASSOCIATION, INC. does not fall within the purview of those homeowners' associations which may be exempted under Section 18 of RA No. 9904. The requisite of the law that the city or municipality concerned lacks resources to provide for basic services is absent from the two (2) certifications issued by the Office of the Mayor of the City of Antipolo, thus, your request cannot be granted for lack of factual and legal basis. (BIR Ruling No. 399-2013 dated November 7, 2013)\n\nConsequently, TOWN & COUNTRY EXECUTIVE VILLAGE HOMEOWNERS' ASSOCIATION, INC., shall be subject to the applicable internal revenue taxes on its income from association dues, rentals of their facilities, trade business and other activities. Specifically:\n\nIncome Tax\n\nIt shall be subject to the corresponding internal revenue taxes imposed under the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) of 1997, as amended, on its income derived from association dues and rentals of its facilities, which income should be returned for taxation. Likewise, interest income from currency bank deposits and yield or any other monetary benefit from deposit substitute instruments and from trust funds and similar arrangements, and royalties derived from sources within the Philippines are subject to the 20% final withholding tax; provided, however, that interest income derived from it from a depository bank under the expanded foreign currency deposit system shall be subject to 15% [1] final withholding tax pursuant to Section 27 (D) (1) in relation to Section 57 (A), both of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended. Moreover, it is required to file on or before April 15 of each year a profit and loss statement and balance sheet with the annual information return under oath, stating its gross income and expenses incurred during the year and a certificate showing that there has not been any change in its By-Laws, Articles of Incorporation, manner of operation and activities as well as resources and disposition of income.\n\nValue-Added Tax or Percentage Tax\n\nLikewise, TOWN & COUNTRY EXECUTIVE VILLAGE HOMEOWNERS' ASSOCIATION, INC.'s gross receipts from operations not derived from association dues, membership fees, rentals of its facilities, other assessments and charges on a purely reimbursement basis, shall be subject to the 12% VAT as imposed under Section 108 of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, or to the 3% percentage tax imposed under Section 116 in relation to Section 109 (BB) of the same Code if the gross sales or receipts from such sale of goods and services do not exceed Three Million Pesos (P3,000,000.00). [2]\n\nIt should be understood that TOWN & COUNTRY EXECUTIVE VILLAGE HOMEOWNERS' ASSOCIATION, INC. shall be constituted as withholding agent of the government if it acts as an employer and its employees receive compensation income subject to the withholding tax under Section 57 of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended.\n\nFinally, TOWN & COUNTRY EXECUTIVE VILLAGE HOMEOWNERS' ASSOCIATION, INC. is also subject to the payment of the annual registration fee of PhP500.00 as prescribed in Section 236 (B) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended. It is also required under Section 6 (C) in relation to Section 237 of the same Code to issue duly registered receipts for services rendered which do not comprise income from association dues and rentals of their facilities.\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be disclosed that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R.

The adopting private entity shall also provide a list of projects and/or activities undertaken and the cost of each undertaking, indicating in particular where and how the assistance has been utilized as supported by the Agreement; and\n\n(2.3) Proof or acknowledgment of receipt of the contributed/donated property by the recipient public school.\n\n(3) That the application, together with the approved Agreement endorsed by the National Secretariat, shall be filed with the Revenue District Office (RDO) having jurisdiction over the place of business of the donor/adopting private entity, copy furnished the RDO having jurisdiction over the property, if the contribution/donation is in the form of real property.\"\n\nIn view of the foregoing, since HOCHENG PHILIPPINES CORPORATION is compliant with the requirements set forth under Section 3 of RR 10-2003, the amount it actually, directly, and exclusively incurred for the Water Closet amounting to __________ is fully deductible from its gross income, plus an additional deduction equivalent to fifty percent _____ thereof in the amount of __________ or a total deductible amount of __________. (BIR Ruling No. 292-2016 dated June 27, 2016)\n\nLastly, Section 101 (A) (1) [1] of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended, provides that:\n\n\"SECTION 101. Exemption of Certain Gifts. \u2014 The following gifts or donations shall be exempt from the tax provided for in this Chapter:\n\n(A) In the Case of Gifts Made by a Resident. \u2014\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(1) Gifts made to or for the use of the National Government or any entity created by any of its agencies which is not conducted for profit, or to any political subdivision of the said Government.\"\n\nThus, pursuant to the above quoted provision, the donation made by HOCHENG PHILIPPINES CORPORATION to DepEd is also exempt from the payment of donor's tax. (BIR Ruling No. 292-2016 dated June 27, 2016)\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be disclosed that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R.

Tan, CPA\n\nSir :\n\nThis refers to your email dated August 14, 2019 seeking clarification and interpretation of existing BIR issuances regarding the individual income tax and withholding government payees.\n\nYou represented that you are an individual earning from self-employment (Sole Proprietorship Business) and practice of profession with your gross sales/receipts and other non-operating income not exceeding P3,000,000.00 VAT threshold during the taxable year.\n\nMoreover, you have already availed of the 8% Income Tax Rate in accordance with the provisions of Revenue Memorandum Order (RMO) No. 23-2018, which will exempt you from paying 3% percentage tax imposed under Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 2-98.\n\nHowever, the local branch of Landbank of the Philippines (LBP) is renting a space in your building for the current year 2019 and it has been withholding from its payment 3% for the Final Withholding Percentage tax and 5% Creditable Withholding Tax.\n\nYou now seek clarification if you will still be subjected to the payment of the 3% percentage tax pursuant to RR No. 2-98 or be exempt from payment of percentage tax considering that you have already availed the 8% income tax rate option for individuals pursuant to RMO No. 23-2018.\n\nIn reply, please be informed that Section 3 (C) of RR No. 8-2018 provides, to wit:\n\n\"A taxpayer who signifies the intention to avail of the 8% income tax rate option, and is conclusively qualified for said option at the end of the taxable year [annual gross sales/receipts and other non-operating income did not exceed the VAT threshold (P3,000,000.00)], shall compute the final annual income tax due based on the actual annual gross sales/receipts and other non-operating income. The said income tax due shall be in lieu of the graduated rates of income tax and the percentage tax under Sec. 116 of the Tax Code, as amended.\"\n\nIn relation thereto, the guidelines for withholding agents/payors on the treatment of income payments if the payee is qualified and opted for the 8% income tax rate are provided under Revenue Memorandum Circular (RMC) No. 50-2018 which states, among others, viz.:\n\n\"Q42: Can you provide a guide for individual taxpayers on the taxability of their earned income from business and/or practice of profession, and for withholding agents/payors on the treatment of income payments if the payee is under the graduated IT rates; if payee is qualified and opted for the 8% IT rate; if subject or not to withholding taxes (WT)?\n\nA42: This will serve as a guide, for individual taxpayers engaged in business and/or practice of profession as well as for withholding agents/payors on the treatment of individual income earnings/payments:\n\nSales Receipts\n\nIf Graduated IT rates\n\nIf 8% IT rate\n\nGross Amt.\n\nTax\n\nTaxability\n\nWT\n\nTaxability\n\nWT\n\nP250,000 and below\n\nIT\n\nTaxable at 0%\n\nNot subject\n\nExempt, if taxpayer's entire income is derived purely from business and or practice of profession; subject to 8%, if mixed income earner (with income from both compensation, and business and or profession), based on gross sales receipts & other non-operating income\n\nNo, for purely business and or profession;\n\nYes, if mixed income earner\n\nPT\n\nSubject\n\nSubject, if government payor\n\nNot Subject\n\nNot subject\n\nDoc\n\nPayee's Sworn Declaration and COR\n\nPayee's Sworn Declaration and COR\n\nAbove P250,000 to P3,000,000\n\nIT\n\nTaxable at applicable graduated rates on net income\n\nSubject at applicable rates\n\n8% on gross sales receipts and other non-operating income; however, for purely business practice \u2014 entitled to reduction of P250,000\n\nSubject to applicable rate\n\nPT\n\nSubject\n\nSubject, if government payor\n\nNot subject\n\nNot subject\n\nDoc\n\nPayee's Sworn Declaration and COR\n\nPayee's Sworn Declaration and COR\n\nAbove P3,000,000\n\nIT\n\nSubject to applicable rate\n\nSubject to WT\n\nNot entitled to avail\n\nBT\n\nNow subject to VAT\n\nSubject to WT of VAT, if government payor\n\n* IT \u2014 Income tax; WT \u2014 Withholding tax; PT \u2014 Percentage tax; BT \u2014 Business tax.\n\nxxx xxx xxx\"\n\nBased on the foregoing, if you qualified and availed of the 8% income tax, you are no longer required to file and pay the 3% percentage tax since the 8% income tax rate is in lieu of the graduated income tax rates and percentage tax under Section 116 of the Tax Code, as amended. It follows, therefore, that your income payments from LBP is not subject to the withholding of 3% percentage tax as clarified by RMO No. 23-2018 and RMC No. 50-2018.\n\nFinally, please take note that the option to avail of the 8% income tax rate must be signified annually, on or before May 15 of each year.\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be ascertained that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R.

Mandalagan, Bacolod City. The corresponding taxes due on the sale of the said properties were already paid. Hence, this query on whether or not the subject real properties owned by ECJSEI for investment and capital appreciation purposes are considered capital assets.\n\nIn reply, please be informed that the term \"capital asset\" as negatively defined in Section 39 (A) (1) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, means property held by the taxpayer (whether or not connected with his trade or business), but does not include stock in trade of the taxpayer or other property of a kind which would properly be included in the inventory of the taxpayer if on hand at the close of the taxable year, or property held by the taxpayer primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of his trade or business, or property used in the trade or business, of a character which is subject to the allowance for depreciation provided in Subsection (F) of Section 34, or real property used in trade or business of the taxpayer.\n\nAn idle property may be classified as capital or ordinary asset. Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 7-2003, particularly Section 3 (e) thereof, provides to wit:\n\n\"SEC. 3. GUIDELINES IN DETERMINING WHETHER A PARTICULAR REAL PROPERTY IS A CAPITAL ASSET OR ORDINARY ASSET. \u2014\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\ne. Treatment of abandoned and idle real properties. \u2014 Real properties formerly forming part of the stock in trade of a taxpayer engaged in the real estate business, or formerly being used in the trade or business of a taxpayer engaged or not engaged in the real estate business, which were later on abandoned and became idle, shall continue to be treated as ordinary assets. Real property initially acquired by a taxpayer engaged in the real estate business shall not result in its conversion into a capital asset even if the same is subsequently abandoned or becomes idle. aScITE\n\nProvided however, that properties classified as ordinary assets for being used in business by a taxpayer engaged in business other than real estate business as defined in Section 2(g) hereof are automatically converted into capital assets upon showing of proof that the same have not been used in business for more than two (2) years prior to the consummation of the taxable transactions involving said properties. (Emphasis supplied)\n\nBased on the above, an idle property classified as ordinary asset is automatically converted into capital asset upon showing of proof that the same has not been used in business for more than two (2) years prior to the consummation of the taxable transaction involving said properties. The automatic conversion of property into capital asset provided in RR No. 7-2003, however, is not necessary when the idle real property is considered capital asset from the moment it was acquired. The subject real properties were acquired for investment purposes and recorded/reported by ECJSEI as capital assets. The properties were never used in the course of trade or business of ECJSEI, or depreciated for that purposes. No improvements were introduced to the subject real properties as certified by the concerned City Assessor where the properties are located. The concerned Barangay also issued a Certification of Non-Use of the subject real properties. More importantly, ECJSEI is not engaged in the real estate business, it did not operate from the time it was incorporated and thus, it has no income-generating activity.\n\nIn view of the foregoing, and considering that ECJSEI is a taxpayer not engaged in the real estate business, being not a real estate dealer, developer or lessor and was organized as a holding company; that the aforementioned properties have been idle and vacant since the time of its acquisition as shown, by the Certifications of the concerned City Assessor; that there are no improvements erected on the land as well as the Certification of concerned Barangay Chairman where the properties are located that the properties have no reported operation or commercial activity; and that the properties have been treated in the books of accounts and are reflected in the audited financial statement as investment properties and have not been used in the ordinary course of trade or business, it is the considered opinion of this Office that the subject real properties described above are classified as capital assets, the conveyance of which is subject to capital gains tax and documentary stamp tax but not subject to VAT and creditable withholding tax. (BIR Ruling Nos. 187-2017 dated April 17, 2017; 634-2017 dated December 19, 2017 and 480-2017 dated October 18, 2017)\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be disclosed that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void. DETACa\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R.

BIR Road, Diliman,\nQuezon City 1104\n\nAttention: Rolando T. Bacani\nPresident\n\nGentlemen :\n\nThis refers to your letter dated September 5, 2013 requesting for reconfirmation of exemption from the twenty percent (20%) final withholding tax on interest income from deposits and deposit substitutes with the banks pursuant to Republic Act (RA) No. 8367, entitled: \"An Act Providing for the Regulation of the Organization and Operation of Non-Stock Savings and Loan Associations.\"\n\nIt is represented that NPC SAVINGS AND LOAN ASSOCIATION, INC. with Taxpayer's Identification No. (TIN) __________ and Certificate of Registration No. __________ dated January 1, 1997, is a corporation duly organized under the laws of the Philippines; that it is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under Company Registration No. _____; that it holds its principal office at NPC Sports Complex, Quezon Avenue cor. BIR Road, Diliman, Quezon City; and that the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), Integrated Supervision Department I, issued a Certification dated February 13, 205 [*] stating that:\n\n1. NPC SAVINGS AND LOAN ASSOCIATION, INC. is a duly registered non-stock savings and loan association, authorized to operate under Republic Act (RA) No. 3779, as amended by RA No. 8367, and continues to operate as a non-stock savings and loan association under the supervision of the BSP; and\n\n2. The Certificate of Authority No. ____ dated March 18, 1974 authorizing the Association to operate as a non-stock savings and loan association, remains to be valid and existing.\n\nIn reply, please be informed as follows:\n\nIncome Tax\n\nSection 5 of RA No. 8367 provides that:\n\n\"SECTION 5. Tax Exemption. \u2014 An Association shall be exempt from payment of tax in respect to income it receives, including interest on its deposits with any bank; Provided, however, That income derived from any of its properties, real or personal, or any activity conducted for profit, regardless of the disposition thereof, is subject to the corresponding internal revenue taxes imposed under the National Internal Revenue Code.\n\nInterest earnings on deposits of members with Associations, as well as the shares of its members from the net income of the Associations shall be exempt from income tax.\"\n\nBased on the foregoing, NPC SAVINGS AND LOAN ASSOCIATION, INC. shall be exempt from income tax with respect to income it receives. Also, interest income derived by it from its deposit and deposit substitutes are exempt from twenty percent (20%) final withholding tax. (BIR Ruling No. 046-15 dated February 11, 2015 and BIR Ruling No. 460-14 dated November 13, 2014)\n\nHowever, any income derived by NPC SAVINGS AND LOAN ASSOCIATION, INC. from any of its properties, real or personal, or any activity conducted for profit, regardless of the disposition thereof, is subject to the applicable income tax and other internal revenue taxes imposed under National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended. It is subject to the applicable income tax depending on the classification of its properties either capital or ordinary asset.\n\nGross Receipts Tax\n\nSection 4 of Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 9-2004, as amended, implementing Section 122 of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended, provides for the imposition of Gross Receipts Tax (GRT) on Non-bank Financial Intermediaries. Section 4 of RR No. 9-2004 states that:\n\n\"SECTION 4. Imposition of Gross Receipts Tax on Other Non-bank Financial Intermediaries. \u2014 Gross receipts of other non-bank financial intermediaries (non-bank financial intermediary not performing quasi-banking functions) doing business in the Philippines shall be subject to GRT at rates and on items of income provided hereunder:\n\n(a) From interest, commissions, discounts and all other items treated as gross income under the Code \u2014 5%\n\n(b) On interests, commissions and discount from lending activities as well as income from financial leasing, on the basis of remaining maturities of the instruments from which such receipts are derived:\n\nMaturity period is five (5) years or less \u2014 5%\n\nMaturity period is more than five (5) years \u2014 1%\n\nxxx xxx xxx\"\n\nThus, NPC SAVINGS AND LOAN ASSOCIATION, INC. is generally subject to GRT on income derived from its operations, unless otherwise exempted under special rules.\n\nDocumentary Stamp Tax\n\nAs provided under Section 5 of RA 8367, a non-stock savings and loan association is only exempt from income tax. Thus, NPC SAVINGS AND LOAN ASSOCIATION, INC., as a non-bank financial intermediary, is subject to Documentary Stamp Tax (DST) under the provisions of RR No. 13-2004 implementing Title VII of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended, particularly on loan agreements, mortgages, pledges, foreclosures and sales, among others.\n\nMoreover, pursuant to RR No. 9-2000, whenever NPC SAVINGS AND LOAN ASSOCIATION, INC. is one of the parties to a taxable transaction, it shall be responsible for the remittance of the DST due regardless of who will bear the burden of paying the DST.\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be disclosed that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R.

Repia, CESO V\nSchools Division Superintendent\n\nGentlemen :\n\nThis refers to your letter requesting legal opinion with regard to the imposition of documentary stamp tax (DST) on various school credentials such as Diploma, Form 137, Certification, Authentication and Verification (CAV) and other school records. In particular, you seek an opinion whether or not such school records may be exempted from the DST and, if not, that the imposition of the same be deferred until the enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) period is fully lifted.\n\nIt was represented that the Department of Education is anticipating the closing of the school year 2019-2020; that the new graduates and transferee-students from various schools will be requesting for the school credentials such as Diploma, Form 137, Certification, Authentication and Verification (CAV) and other school records; that as part of the collection drive of the Government, schools under your jurisdiction are advised to require those who requested the aforesaid records to affix DST for very issuance of records or certificates before the release of the same; that being under the ECQ, you are cognizant of the fact that most of your students are saddled with financial constraints and, more often than not, their parents are prioritizing to buy food to sustain their daily living; and that it is your opinion that failure to affix the required stamp on a taxable document shall not invalidate the same but will have the effect of non-recording of documents in the government registry, inadmissibility thereof as evidence in any courts and no notary or other officer authorized to administer oaths shall add his jurat or acknowledgement to the document until the required stamp is affixed thereto and cancelled.\n\nIn reply, please be informed that the issue on the imposition of the DST on school records, such as Diploma, Form 137, Certification, Authentication and Verification (CAV) and other school records issued for the purpose of giving information or establishing a proof of a fact, is already settled. Section 188 of the 1997 Tax Code, as amended, provides, to wit:\n\n\"SEC. 188. Stamp Tax on Certificates. \u2014 On each certificate of damages or otherwise, and on every certificate or document issued by any customs officer, marine surveyor, or other person acting as such, and on each certificate issued by a notary public, and on each certificate of any description required by law or by rules or regulations of a public office, or which is issued for the purpose of giving information, or establishing proof of a fact, and not otherwise specified herein, there shall be collected a documentary stamp tax of Thirty pesos (P30.00).\" [1] (Underscoring supplied)\n\nClearly, school records, such as Diploma, Form 137, Certification, Authentication and Verification (CAV), are documents which are issued by the school to give information or to establish proof of a fact and, thus, fall within the ambit of Section 188 of the 1997 Tax Code, as amended.\n\nRelative to the above, the BIR has issued Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 9-2000, identifying the persons liable for the DST and the mode of payment/remittance of the said tax under certain conditions. As enunciated in the aforesaid Regulations, the DST is a tax imposed against the person making, signing, issuing, accepting or transferring the document or facility evidencing the aforesaid transactions. However, whenever one of the parties to the taxable document is exempt from the DST, the other party who is not exempt shall be the one directly liable for the said tax. This was further clarified in Revenue Memorandum Circular (RMC) No. 25-2008 particularly with regard to the obligation of educational institutions to remit the DST in respect of issuance of taxable certificates such as Diploma, Transcript of Records and other taxable certificates. Said RMC provides, to wit:\n\n\"Sec. 3. Mode of Payment and Remittance of Tax. \u2014\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(4) When one of the parties to taxable document or transaction is included in any of the entities enumerated below, such entity shall be responsible for the remittance of the stamp tax prescribed under Title VII of the Code: Provided, however, that if such entity is exempt from tax herein imposed, it shall remit the tax as a collecting agent, pursuant to the preceding paragraph 3 (b) (2) hereof, any provision of these Regulations to the contrary notwithstanding:\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(e) An educational institution in respect of issuance of taxable certificates (e.g., Diploma, Transcript of Records, and other documents taxable as certificates under Section 188 of the Code);\"\n\nIn BIR Ruling No. 143-2010, we had the occasion to rule that notwithstanding the tax exemption of educational institutions, they are \"collecting agents\" for the BIR for the purpose of remitting to the BIR the DST on diplomas and transcript of records, issued by them in favor of non-exempt persons or entities, and that should they fail to remit the DST on diplomas and transcripts of record to the BIR as such \"collecting agents,\" the educational institutions shall be held personally liable for the DST.\n\nAnent your request for the deferment of the payment of the DST until the ECQ has been lifted by the Government, please take note of RR No. 7-2020, as amended by RR No. 30-2020, which provides for the extension of statutory deadlines and timelines for the filing and submission of any documents and the payment of taxes during the ECQ period. Under the said Regulations, the filing of DST returns and the payment of the taxes due thereon for transactions for the month of March which falls due on April 5, 2020 has been extended until May 20, 2020. The Regulations further provides that if the ECQ period will be extended further, then the filing of the returns and payment of the corresponding taxes due thereon shall also be extended by thirty (30) calendar days from the lifting of the ECQ.\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be disclosed that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R. DULAY\nCommissioner of Internal Revenue\n\n1. As amended by Republic Act No. 10963 or the TRAIN Law.",

Pascual Ave., Catmon, Malabon City and covered by Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. M-41984 issued by the Registry of Deeds of Malabon City; that it is a non-stock, non-profit organization duly registered with the Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board (HLURB) under Certificate of Registration No. 01878; that the aforesaid lot was acquired through a loan under the Community Mortgage Program (CMP) with Foundation for Alternatives, Inc., as Originator, that said project was taken-out/paid on November 23, 2004 in the amount of _________________________ Pesos (P__________), involving One Hundred Fifty-Four (154) beneficiaries; that on July 22, 2019, a Deed of Absolute Sale was executed by SAMAHANG MARALITA CATMON HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION, INC. in favor of its member-beneficiary, to wit:\n\nMember-Beneficiary\n\nTCT No.\n\nLot Area (sq. m.)\n\nAddress\n\nBBB\n\nM-41984\n\n22.5\n\n____________________\n\nand that BBB, a member-beneficiary, is now in the process of transferring the purchased property to her name.\n\nIn reply, please be informed that the transfer by SAMAHANG MARALITA CATMON HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION, INC. in favor of the above-named member-beneficiary who has made full payment of her purchased subdivided lot is not subject to either the CGT imposed under Section 27 (D) (5) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, or the creditable withholding tax imposed under Revenue Regulations No. 2-98, as amended, considering that the said transfer of property is made only as a formality to finally effect the transfer of the said property to its member-beneficiary, BBB, who actually bought the same from the former owner through the Association. In other words, the association is merely transferring the ownership of the property to its member-beneficiary who actually owns the aforedescribed lot.\n\nFurthermore, the said transfer is not subject to the donor's tax imposed under Section 98 of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, since there is no donative intent on the part of the Association to donate the said property to said member-beneficiary, considering that it could not donate property the ownership of which already belongs to the member-beneficiary. (BIR Ruling No. 034-2015 dated February 5, 2015)\n\nIt is noted that under Section 196 of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, the deeds or documents subject to the documentary stamp tax (DST) imposed therein are those where the realty sold shall be granted, assigned, transferred, or otherwise conveyed to a purchaser or purchasers or to any other person or persons designated by such purchaser or purchasers, thereby excluding from its purview the instant case considering that the supposed purchaser is actually the owner thereof.\n\nAccordingly, the transfer of title of the subject lot in favor of the above-named beneficiary is not subject to DST under Section 196 of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended. However, the notarial acknowledgement to the deed of conveyance is subject to the documentary stamp tax of P30.00 [1] pursuant to Section 188 of the Tax Code of 1997. (BIR Ruling No. 034-2015 dated February 5, 2015).\n\nIt is, however, understood that the Certificate Authorizing Registration (CAR) shall only be issued after the submission of the requirements provided under RMO 15-2003 and after it is established upon proper verification by the Revenue District Officer (RDO) concerned that, considering the rules on valuation of real property, the actual selling price per sale transaction in this case does not exceed P450,000.00 for house and lot and P180,000.00 for lot only for each qualified beneficiaries. (BIR Ruling No. 034-2015 dated February 5, 2015)\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be disclosed that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R. DULAY\nCommissioner of Internal Revenue\n\n1. The new DST rate is used since the transaction took place after the effectivity of RA 10963 or TRAIN Law.",

It is duly registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under Company Registration Number CS094-000130. Its primary purpose is to acquire, by purchase or lease or otherwise, lands and interests in lands or buildings or improvements in said lands, and to own, hold, improve, develop and manage any real estate so acquired. It is registered with the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) with Tax Identification Number (TIN) 000-000-000-00000. HTcADC\n\nPPC is also registered with the Philippine Economic Zone Authority (PEZA) as an Ecozone Facilities Enterprise under PEZA Certificate of Registration No. 94-A10-F dated March 25, 1994, The Company's original registration with PEZA was subsequently amended for every additional or expansion project that the company undertook. One of such expansions refer to the constriction of three (3) storey factory buildings at the Mactan Economic Zone II-Special Economic (MEZ II-SEZ). This amendment is covered by a Fourth Supplemental Agreement with PEZA dated March 6, 2000, such supplemental agreement forming an integral part of the original contract. Under the subject Supplemental Agreement, PPC's expansion project shall be entitled to the following incentive-exemption from national and local taxes, and in lieu thereof, payment of five percent (5%) on gross income earned in accordance with Section 24 of RA No. 7916, as amended, and its implementing rules, subject to the setting up of separate books of accounts for the said projects. Subsequently, the PEZA and the Company entered into a Restatement of Supplemental Agreement dated March 6, 2000 whereby PEZA approved PPC's request for amendment to reflect the three (3) factory building's correct number of storeys, actual gross floor area, and specific locations. Under the subject Restatement, the gross floor area of PPC 8 has been amended from 8,300 square meters (as indicated in the March 6, 2000 Supplemental Agreement) to its actual area of 6,049 square meters.\n\nOn the other hand, NKC is a domestic corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the Philippines, with principal office at the Mactan Economic Zone II, Lapu-lapu City. It is duly registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under Company Registration No. C199700357. Its purpose is to engage in, operate, conduct and maintain the business of manufacturing, importing, exporting, buying, selling or otherwise dealing in, at wholesale such goods as parts for roller bearings, conveyor systems, sash rollers, rubber seals, metal core plates, automotive parts and components, radial retainer, die parts of metal retainer and other miscellaneous parts and goods of similar nature. It is registered with the BIR with TIN 000-000-000-000, as well as with the PEZA as an Export Enterprise under PEZA Certificate of Registration No. 97-031. CAIHTE\n\nOn June 19, 2018, a Deed of Absolute Sale was executed between PPC and NKC for the sale of a factory building (Factory Unit No. 8 or PPC 8) located in Mactan Economic Zone 2, Lapu-lapu City. The factory building has a total floor area of six thousand forty nine square meters (6,049) and is covered by Tax Declaration No. 006-00474 issued by the Lapu-lapu City Assessor's Office. The subject factory unit is one of the 3 factory buildings subject of the Company's Fourth Supplemental Agreement with PEZA and the subsequent Restatement of Supplemental Agreement. Prior to the sale, PEZA issued Letter of Authority No. 17-MEZ-OZA-SB-0001 dated September 4, 2017 approving PPC's request to sell the subject factory building in favor of NKC.\n\nIn reply, please be informed that PEZA-registered enterprises are exempt from paying all local and national taxes and, in lieu thereof, are only subject to the 5% special tax on gross income, to be distributed in accordance with Section 24 of RA No. 7916, to wit:\n\n\"SEC. 24. Exemption from National and Local Taxes. \u2014 Except for real property taxes on land owned by developers, no taxes, local and national, shall be imposed on business establishments operating within the ECOZONE. In lieu thereof, five percent (5%) of the gross income earned by all business enterprises within the ECOZONE shall be paid and remitted as follows:\n\n(a) Three percent (3%) to the National Government;\n\n(b) Two percent (2%) which shall be directly remitted by the business establishments to the treasurer's office of the municipality or city where the enterprise is located.\n\nxxx xxx xxx\"\n\nBased on the foregoing, since the factory unit is one of the 3 factory buildings subject of the PPC's Fourth Supplemental Agreement with PEZA and the subsequent Restatement of Supplemental Agreement, the sale thereof by PPC to NKC is covered by the 5% special tax on gross income. Accordingly, the aforesaid sale is no longer subject to VAT and DST. As to the CWT, Section 2.57.5 (B) (2) of Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 2-98, as amended, provides:\n\n\"SECTION 2.57.5. Exemption from Withholding. \u2014 The withholding of creditable withholding tax prescribed in these Regulations shall not apply to income payments made to the following:\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(B) Persons enjoying exemption from payment of income taxes pursuant to the provisions of any law, general or special, such as but not limited to the following:\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(2) Corporations registered with the Board of Investments, Philippine Export Processing Zones and Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority enjoying exemption from the income tax pursuant to EO 226, as amended, Republic Act No. 7916 and the Omnibus Investments Code of 1987 and RA 7227, as amended, respectively;\" (Underscoring supplied)\n\nBased thereon, it is clear that the creditable withholding tax does not apply to income payments to persons enjoying exemption from payment of income taxes pursuant to the provisions of any law, general or special. Accordingly, since PPC is an enterprise enjoying exemption from the payment of income tax pursuant to RA No. 7916, its revenues derived directly in connection with its registered activity as Ecozone Facilities Enterprise, shall not be subject to the CWT prescribed under RR No. 2-98, as amended. aScITE\n\nIt should be understood that PPC shall be constituted as a withholding agent for the government if it acts as employer and any of its employees receive compensation income subject to compensation withholding tax, or if it makes payments to individuals or corporations subject to the withholding taxes at source as required under Chapter XIII and Section 57 of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended and implemented by RR No. 2-98, as amended.\n\nPursuant to Section 4 of Republic Act (RA) No. 10708, [1] PPC is required to file its tax returns and pay its tax liabilities, on or before the deadline as provided under the 1997 Tax Code, as amended, using the electronic system for filing and payment of taxes of the BIR. Furthermore, it shall file with PEZA a complete annual tax incentives report of its income-based tax incentives, VAT and duty exemptions, deductions, credits or exclusions from the tax base, as may be provided under RA No. 7916, within thirty (30) days from the deadline for filing of tax returns and payment of taxes. DETACa\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be ascertained that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R.

HTcADC\n\nIn reply, please be informed as follows:\n\nIncome Tax\n\nSection 5 of RA No. 8367 provides that:\n\n\"SECTION 5. Tax Exemption. \u2014 An Association shall be exempt from payment of tax in respect to income it receives, including interest on its deposits with any bank; Provided, however, That income derived from any of its properties, real or personal, or any activity conducted for profit, regardless of the disposition thereof, is subject to the corresponding internal revenue taxes imposed under the National Internal Revenue Code.\n\nInterest earnings on deposits of members with Associations, as well as the shares of its members from the net income of the Associations shall be exempt from income tax.\"\n\nBased on the foregoing, MERALCO EMPLOYEES SAVINGS & LOAN ASSOCIATION, INC. shall be exempt from income tax with respect to income it receives. Also, interest income derived by it from its deposit and deposit substitutes is exempt from twenty percent (20%) final withholding tax. (BIR Ruling No. 046-15 dated February 11, 2015 and BIR Ruling No. 460-14 dated November 13, 2014)\n\nHowever, any income derived by MERALCO EMPLOYEES SAVINGS & LOAN ASSOCIATION, INC. from any of its properties, real or personal, or any activity conducted for profit, regardless of the disposition thereof, is subject to the applicable income tax and other internal revenue taxes imposed under National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended. It is subject to the applicable income tax depending on the classification of its properties as capital or ordinary asset. CAIHTE\n\nGross Receipts Tax\n\nSection 4 of Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 9-2004, as amended, implementing Section 122 of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended, provides for the imposition of Gross Receipts Tax (GRT) on Non-bank Financial Intermediaries. Section 4 of RR No. 9-2004 states that:\n\n\"SECTION 4. Imposition of Gross Receipts Tax on Other Non-bank Financial Intermediaries. \u2014 Gross receipts of other non-bank financial intermediaries (non-bank financial intermediary not performing quasi-banking functions) doing business in the Philippines shall be subject to GRT at rates and on items of income provided hereunder:\n\n(a) From interest, commissions, discounts and all other items treated as gross income under the Code \u2014 5%\n\n(b) On interests, commissions and discounts from lending activities as well as income from financial leasing, on the basis of remaining maturities of the instruments from which such receipts are derived:\n\nMaturity period is five (5) years or less \u2014 5%\n\nMaturity period is more than five (5) years \u2014 1%\n\nxxx xxx xxx\"\n\nThus, MERALCO EMPLOYEES SAVINGS & LOAN ASSOCIATION, INC. is generally subject to GRT on income derived from its operations, unless otherwise exempted under special rules.\n\nDocumentary Stamp Tax\n\nAs provided under Section 5 of RA 8367, a non-stock savings and loan association is only exempt from income tax. Thus, MERALCO EMPLOYEES SAVINGS & LOAN ASSOCIATION, INC., as a non-bank financial intermediary, is subject to Documentary Stamp Tax (DST) under the provisions of RR No. 13-2004 implementing Title VII of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended, particularly on loan agreements, mortgages, pledges, foreclosures and sales, among others.\n\nMoreover, pursuant to RR No. 9-2000, whenever MERALCO EMPLOYEES SAVINGS & LOAN ASSOCIATION, INC. is one of the parties to a taxable transaction, it shall be responsible for the remittance of the DST due regardless of who will bear the burden of paying the DST. aScITE\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be disclosed that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R.

Irasan, Roxas\n\nZamboanga Del Norte\n\nAttention: AAA\n_______________\n\nGentlemen :\n\nThis refers to your letter dated May 6, 2014 requesting on behalf of Dipolog Coconut Oil Mill, Inc. (the \"Company\"), certificate of exemption from income tax and expanded withholding tax on account of its registration with the Philippine Economic Zone Authority (PEZA) under Republic Act (RA) No. 7916.\n\nDocuments submitted show that the Company, with Tax Identification No. (TIN) 000-000-000-000, is a domestic corporation duly organized under the Philippine laws, with office address at Barangay Irasan, Roxas, Zamboanga Del Norte; that it registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) bearing SEC Certificate of Registration No. CS201010141; that the Company is also a duly registered PEZA Ecozone Export Enterprise bearing PEZA Certificate of Registration No. 13-04 dated January 11, 2013; that based on the PEZA Certification dated January 16, 2014, the Company is entitled to the corporate income tax holiday (ITH) for a period of four (4) years for the original project effective on the committed date of start of commercial operations, or the actual date of start of commercial operations, whichever is earlier, and thereafter, the Company is subject only to the five percent (5%) final tax on gross income (GIT); and that per Sworn Certification dated March 8, 2013 executed by BBB, ________ of the Company, the start of the commercial operation of the Company was in February 2013. HTcADC\n\nIt is further shown that the Company's registered activity, under its Registration Agreement with PEZA, is limited to oil milling of crude oil and copra cake, and the importation of raw materials, machinery, equipment, tools, goods, wares, articles, or merchandise directly used in its registered operations at IRASAN-ROXAS ZANORTE SPECIAL ECONOMIC ZONE.\n\nBased on the above representations, you now request for exemption from income tax and the creditable withholding tax on the payments received by the Company from the conduct of its PEZA-registered activity.\n\nIn reply, please be informed that under Section 2.57.5 (B) (2) of Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 2-98, as amended by RR No. 6-2001 implementing Section 57 (B) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, the withholding tax prescribed in the said Regulations shall not apply to income payments to persons enjoying exemption from the income tax provided by Republic Act No. 7916 and the Omnibus Investments Code of 1987. (BIR Ruling No. 334-2011 dated September 7, 2011)\n\nAccordingly, since Dipolog Coconut Oil Mill, Inc.'s activity of oil milling of crude oil and copra cake has been duly registered with PEZA, this Office is of the opinion as it hereby holds, that income payments received by Dipolog Coconut Oil Mill, Inc. in connection with the oil milling of crude oil and copra cake are exempt from the creditable withholding tax imposed under RR No. 2-98, as amended by RR No. 6-2001, during the period of its ITH and GIT regimes.\n\nIt must be emphasized that the above exemption from the income tax and creditable withholding tax covers only the income directly attributable to the revenues generated by Dipolog Coconut Oil Mill, Inc. from its PEZA-registered activity of oil milling of crude oil and copra cake, located at IRASAN-ROXAS ZANORTE SPECIAL ECONOMIC ZONE. CAIHTE\n\nMoreover, Dipolog Coconut Oil Mill, Inc.'s entitlement to ITH for its registered activity of oil milling of crude oil and copra cake is not automatic as it has still to comply with the provisions of its Registration Agreement with PEZA, viz.:\n\n(1) The Company shall use new machinery and equipment worth Php____________ for its operations that will be used for the first time in the Philippines, i.e., the machinery and equipment have not been used by any manufacturing enterprise in the Philippines. The Company shall secure a written verification/confirmation from the PEZA Director General of its compliance with the foregoing requirements. For this purpose, the Company shall file an application for said validation not later than forty-five (45) days after the 1st year of its commercial operations, reckoned from the date of SCO of the project as attested by the MEZ Administrator. (13.5 Registration Agreement)\n\n(2) The Company shall observe the following export sales schedules (13.7 Registration Agreement):\n\nVOLUME (MT)\n\nYear\n\nCrude Oil\n\nCopra Cake\n\n1\n\n30,000\n\n16,000\n\n2\n\n40,000\n\n22,000\n\n3\n\n60,000\n\n32,600\n\nVALUE (US$'000)\n\nYear\n\nCrude Oil\n\nCopra Cake\n\nTotal Value\n\n1\n\n_______\n\n_______\n\n_______\n\n2\n\n_______\n\n_______\n\n_______\n\n3\n\n_______\n\n_______\n\n_______\n\n(3) The Company shall engage exclusively in PEZA-registered/authorized projects/activities. Any expansion of this project or other activities to be undertaken by the Company shall require prior PEZA clearance/approval (13.10 Registration Agreement).\n\nPursuant to Section 4 of Republic Act (RA) No. 10708, [1] Dipolog Coconut Oil Mill, Inc. is required to file its tax returns and pay its tax liabilities, on or before the deadline as provided under the 1997 Tax Code, as amended, using the electronic system for filing and payment of taxes of the BIR. Furthermore, Dipolog Coconut Oil Mill, Inc. shall file with PEZA a complete annual tax incentives report of its income-based tax incentives, VAT and duty exemptions, deductions, credits or exclusions from the tax base, as may be provided under RA No. 7916, within the periods prescribed under R.A. 10708's Implementing Rules and Regulations and Joint Memorandum Circular No. 1-2016 dated September 1, 2016.\n\nIt should be understood that Dipolog Coconut Oil Mil, Inc. shall be constituted as a withholding agent for the government if it acts as employer and any of its employees receive compensation income subject to compensation withholding tax, or if it makes payments to individuals or corporations subject to the withholding taxes at source as required under Chapter XIII and Section 57 of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended and implemented by Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 2-98, as amended.\n\nLikewise, Dipolog Coconut Oil Mill, Inc. is required to file on or before the 15th day of the fourth month following the close of its accounting period a Profit and Loss Statement and Balance Sheet with the Annual Information Return under oath, stating its gross income and expenses incurred during the taxable year. aScITE\n\nFinally, the Dipolog Coconut Oil Mill, Inc.'s books of accounts and other pertinent records shall be subject to periodic examination by revenue enforcement officers of this Bureau for the purpose of ascertaining whether it has been complying with the conditions under which it has been granted tax exemption or tax incentives and its tax liability, if any, pursuant to Section 235 of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended.\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation it will be disclosed that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R. DULAY\nCommissioner of Internal Revenue\n\n1. An Act Enhancing Transparency in the Management and Accounting of Tax Incentives Administered by Investment Promotion Agencies.",
