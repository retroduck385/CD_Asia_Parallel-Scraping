                                    "Details": "I. BACKGROUND\n\nAs part of the BIR's initiative to achieve the highest level of recognition in the Civil Service Commission's Program to Institutionalize Meritocracy and Excellence in Human Resource Management (CSC PRIME-HRM), the Human Resource Development Service (HRDS) has developed and integrated a Competency-based Human Resource Management System (CBHRMS) into its four (4) core HRM systems: Recruitment, Selection and Placement; Learning and Development; Performance Management; and Rewards & Recognition. The development and implementation of CBHRMS align with the PRIME-HRM Enhanced Maturity Level Indicators, as specified in CSC Memorandum Circular (MC) No. 24, s. 2016, to ensure that BIR's HRM practices meet the highest standards of excellence, professionalism, and institutionalization. HTcADC\n\nTo support this, BIR has moved from a process-defined HRM approach to a competency-based approach, involving identification and development of knowledge, skills, and attitudes (competencies) needed for success. This transition can be achieved through training, skill building, learning interventions, and improved workforce planning and hiring practices. Ultimately, leading to improved job performance and satisfaction. This shifts the focus from processes to the capabilities of individuals and how they contribute to organizational goals.\n\nCBHRMS is beneficial both to the employees and the management as it offers a standard structure for recruitment, selection and placement, learning and development, work expectations, performance evaluation, career advancement paths, and rewards and recognition. It minimizes personal bias and subjectivity in hiring and promotion decisions, ensuring that employees are well-suited for their roles. Furthermore, the appropriate learning and development interventions/programs will be designed, developed, implemented, and evaluated within the right time frame to help employees achieve the required competency levels for career pathing and succession planning. By following the standards implemented through CBHRMS, employees receive the necessary support, training, capability-building interventions, and career development opportunities to achieve their performance goals while contributing to the Bureau's mission of delivering efficient and effective public service.\n\nII. OBJECTIVES\n\nThis Order is issued to: CAIHTE\n\n1. Discuss the theory and best practices of competency modeling, identification, and assessment as a foundation for the four (4) core pillars of PRIME-HRM: Recruitment, Selection and Placement, Learning and Development, Performance Management, and Rewards & Recognition; and\n\n2. Prescribe policies for the effective implementation of CBHRMS in the BIR to ensure a consistent, competency-based approach across all HRM systems.\n\nIII. SCOPE AND COVERAGE\n\nThis Order shall apply to:\n\n1. All BIR employees involved in the processes of recruitment, selection, placement, performance management, learning and development, and rewards and recognition;\n\n2. All four (4) core human resource management systems: Recruitment, Selection, and Placement; Learning and development; Performance Management; and Rewards and Recognition;\n\n3. Workforce planning, career and competency development, and succession planning initiatives within the Bureau; and\n\n4. All BIR employees, regardless of position or salary grade, across all offices within the Bureau, to ensure that they consistently demonstrate the required competencies for the effective performance of their duties and responsibilities.\n\nIV. DEFINITION OF TERMS\n\n1. Baseline Position Profile \u2014 provides a detailed list of competencies and proficiency levels required for each position to ensure relevance, clarity, consistency, and fairness in job expectations and performance evaluations across the Bureau.\n\n2. Behavioral Indicators \u2014 demonstrated actions that indicate the presence of competency (knowledge, skills, attitudes and other attributes) at a particular proficiency level.\n\n3. Check-and-Stop Method \u2014 is a competency mapping technique in which functional competency is assessed for its relevance and applicability to a specific position. This method is also used for the leadership competencies of SG18-23 positions.\n\n4. Competency \u2014 defined as observable and measurable complement of knowledge, skills, and attitudes essential for successful job performance. aScITE\n\n5. Competency Definition \u2014 a clear and concise description of competency and its importance within the BIR context.\n\n6. Competency Dictionary \u2014 the official reference document defining the competencies required within the BIR. It contains detailed competency tables for each identified competency.\n\n7. Competency Framework \u2014 blueprint of the design, development, implementation, integration, monitoring, evaluation, and assessment of the CBHRMS for the BIR.\n\n8. Competency Mapping/Profiling \u2014 the process of identifying the required competencies and proficiency levels for each position to create a standardized baseline position profile within the Bureau.\n\n9. Competency Modeling \u2014 the process of identifying and defining the knowledge, skills, and attitudes required within the BIR. It is a framework that helps agencies align their human resource management practices with their strategic goals.\n\n10. Competency Table \u2014 a structured outline consisting of the competency cluster, competency definition, rubrics/4-proficiency levels and descriptions, and behavioral indicators of each competency to provide understanding of how a particular competency is demonstrated.\n\n11. Core Competencies \u2014 fundamental knowledge, skills, and attitudes required for all BIR employees, regardless of their function or role.\n\n12. Cluster code \u2014 represents the identification of the competencies based on Core (e.g., C1, C2, C3 . . .), Leadership (e.g., L1, L2, L3 . . .), and Functional (e.g., F1, F2, F3 . . .) classifications.\n\n13. Floor-and-Ceiling Method \u2014 is a competency mapping technique in which a specific proficiency level for each of the core competency is mapped across a range of positions \u2014 from the lowest (floor) to the highest (ceiling) salary grades or position levels.\n\n14. Functional Competencies \u2014 job-specific skills and technical knowledge required to perform duties effectively. These competencies vary depending on the employee's function or role.\n\n15. Leadership Competencies \u2014 competencies essential for officials and employees in leadership and management roles, including those in the pipeline for succession planning.\n\n16. Proficiency levels or competency levels \u2014 refer to a scale that outlines varying levels of progression for each competency. These levels reflect the increasing depth of expertise, responsibility, and complexity expected at different salary grades or job positions.\n\n17. Rubric \u2014 refers to the explicit criteria that tells \"what counts\" in assessing demonstration of the competencies. DETACa\n\n18. Rubric description \u2014 serves as reference in determining behavioral indicators.\n\nV. POLICIES\n\n1. Competencies shall refer to the integrated set of knowledge, skills, and attitudes that all employees are expected to demonstrate in the effective fulfillment of their roles and responsibilities. These competencies are anchored on the BIR's vision and mission, core values, strategy map, and mandate. All BIR employees are required to develop, apply, and continuously enhance these competencies to meet established performance expectations, support organizational goals, and uphold the standards of excellence in public service.\n\n2. The Competency Model and Profiles shall align with the standards set by the CSC PRIME-HRM Maturity Level 3, which emphasizes the integration of CBHRMS into the key areas of human resource management. This model ensures that employee competencies are aligned with the Bureau's organizational anchors, i.e., mission, vision, core values, strategic goals and directions, equipping personnel with the essential knowledge, skills, and attitudes for effective job performance. Competency modeling and job profiling will provide a platform for more objective, fair, and defensible human resource management processes for the Bureau.\n\nThe Competency Modeling shall consist of the following three (3) components:\n\na. Competency Framework\n\nb. Competency Model\n\nc. Competency Dictionary\n\n3. The CBHRMS Framework, as shown below, shall serve as the blueprint of the Bureau's journey towards institutionalizing meritocracy and excellence in delivering public service. It shall guide the Bureau in integrating the competency-based principles into its human resource management policies, practices, and processes to ensure a strategic, consistent, and objective approach to workforce development.\n\nThe framework is represented as a wheel, with the Bureau's competency clusters and functional group forming its structure. At the center is the BIR logo, symbolizing the agency's mandate, aspiration, mission, and core values, which serve as the foundation of the Bureau's competency journey. The middle blue gradient layer represents the five functional groups: Office of the Commissioner (OCIR), Legal Group (LG), Information Systems Group (ISG), Resource Management Group (RMG), and Operations Group (OG). Surrounding these functional groups are the competencies represented by a color derived from the BIR logo and the Philippine flag, and clustered into Core, Leadership, and Functional competencies. This framework reflects the BIR's cohesiveness, with its workforce moving as one towards service excellence. HEITAD\n\n4. The BIR Competency Model, represented by Competency Tables, shall be composed of the following elements:\n\na. Competency Name identified from the organizational anchors\n\nb. Competency Definition aligned with the determined Competency Cluster\n\nc. Rubrics/4-proficiency levels and Descriptions of each level per competency that are aligned with the competency definition\n\nd. Behavioral Indicators per rubric/proficiency level aligned with respective level description\n\n5. The BIR shall adopt a systematic and strategic approach in identifying competencies to ensure alignment with its organizational mandate, strategic direction, and performance standards. The following processes and approaches shall be observed:\n\na. Competency identification shall align with the BIR's vision, mission, and core values to ensure employees support the agency's purpose and direction.\n\nb. The BIR's organizational structure shall be reviewed to establish a clear understanding of job roles and responsibilities, forming the basis for determining required competencies.\n\nc. Existing job descriptions and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) shall be analyzed to identify the specific knowledge, skills, and attitudes contributing to high performance in each role. aDSIHc\n\nd. The BIR's strategy map and Major Final Outputs (MFOs) shall be utilized to determine the competencies necessary for delivering strategic priorities and achieving key organizational outcomes.\n\ne. Competencies shall be benchmarked against best practices from other government agencies to guide the selection of relevant competencies.\n\n6. Competencies shall be defined using the following elements:\n\na. Competency name \u2014 Reflects the complement of knowledge, skills, and attitude manifested through observable behaviors.\n\nb. Competency definition \u2014 Includes a behavioral action word, describes how the work is performed, indicates output aligned with the BIR's strategic goals, and highlights the expected quality of outcomes.\n\nc. Rubrics/4-Proficiency levels and Description \u2014 Each competency shall be further defined using rubrics across four (4) proficiency levels: Basic (Level 1), Intermediate (Level 2), Advanced (Level 3), and Superior (Level 4). These levels shall reflect the depth of expertise, responsibility, and complexity expected at different salary grades or job positions. Progression through these levels shall be guided by the following dimensions:\n\ni. Intensity \u2014 Degree of involvement or completeness of action\n\nii. Vertical Complexity \u2014 Considering more people, data, figures, concepts, ideas, etc. into account\n\niii. Horizontal Complexity \u2014 Ranging from simple and routine to highly intricate or complex\n\niv. Scope \u2014 Similar tasks in a narrow environment to increased tasks in a broad environment\n\nv. Time horizon \u2014 Action planning on anticipated future situation\n\nvi. Breadth of impact \u2014 Number of positions or people or job groups affected\n\nvii. Autonomy \u2014 Degree of supervision or level of decision-making power\n\nviii. Context \u2014 From a narrowly defined work environment to multiple or wide variety of work environments\n\nd. Behavioral indicators \u2014 At each rubric/proficiency level, specific behavioral indicators shall be defined to describe how competency is demonstrated. These indicators must be observable, measurable, verifiable, and capable of being developed through training or other capacity-building interventions. Each behavioral indicator shall include a behavioral action word, object of the action, and the corresponding attribute or expected output. ATICcS\n\n7. The BIR shall maintain a Competency Dictionary (Annex A), which shall serve as the official, standardized reference tool for the Bureau's human resource management and organizational development initiatives. The Competency Dictionary consists of seventy-two (72) competencies, categorized as follows:\n\na. Core Competencies (8 competencies) \u2014 Applicable to all positions within the Bureau; when identifying core competencies, the Build Approach (as against Buy/Borrow, Borrow-and-Modify, or Buy-and-Modify), is the most appropriate since the organization is a unique entity that exists in a specific environment. The process of identifying core competencies for the BIR begins with a review of its culture, mission, aspiration, values, and strategic goals.\n\nb. Leadership Competencies (6 competencies) \u2014 Applicable to leadership or managerial positions. In identifying competencies of managers/leaders of the organization the Competency Menu Method can be a good option because of the many well-researched management and leadership competency models that are available. The BIR developed one leadership competency (L1) and adopted five (5) additional leadership competencies (L2-L6) from the CSC pursuant to CSC MC No. 05, s. 2016; and\n\nc. Functional Competencies (58 competencies) \u2014 Specific to job roles or offices based on technical or operational requirements. For technical or functional competencies, all approaches to competency modelling (Buy, Buy-and-Modify, Borrow-and-Modify, and Build) may be used. The Build Approach, however, is still the best way to develop a competency model (for the BIR) that responds precisely to the needs of the Bureau.\n\nThe Competency Dictionary shall be utilized for the following purposes:\n\na. Identifying and mapping competencies required for specific positions;\n\nb. Developing competency-based job descriptions for all positions within the Bureau;\n\nc. Guiding assessment of candidates through competency-based interviews and selection tools and techniques;\n\nd. Assessing employee's current competency levels to support career and competency development, succession planning, and performance management; and\n\ne. Designing, developing, and implementing competency-based learning and development programs tailored to the Bureau's needs. ETHIDa\n\n8. The BIR shall establish a Baseline Position Profile (Annex B) outlining the required competencies and corresponding proficiency levels for each plantilla position within the Bureau. The following techniques shall be employed in mapping the competency requirements for each position:\n\na. Floor-and-Ceiling Method \u2014 a specific proficiency level is mapped across a range of positions \u2014 from the lowest (floor) to the highest (ceiling) salary grades or position levels. This method ensures consistent competency expectations across all job levels.\n\nb. Check-and-Stop Method \u2014 a competency is assessed for its relevance and applicability to a specific position. The process involves reviewing the competency definition and its behavioral indicators, checking those that align with the position's duties and responsibilities, and stopping when a behavioral indicator is no longer relevant. This method ensures that only applicable competencies are assigned, resulting in a focused and role-specific competency profile.\n\n9. The Floor-and-Ceiling Method shall be used to map the Core Competencies. The required proficiency levels for Core Competencies shall be as follows:\n\nSalary Grade (SG)\n\nRequired Proficiency Level\n\nSG 2-14\n\nBasic\n\nSG 15-18\n\nIntermediate\n\nSG 19-24\n\nAdvanced\n\nSG 25 & above\n\nSuperior\n\n10. For Functional competencies, the Head of Office shall be responsible for identifying and mapping the required competencies and proficiency levels for each position within their respective offices, using the Check-and-Stop Method. This process shall be based on the defined roles, responsibilities, and functional requirements of the position.\n\n11. The BIR shall adopt the leadership competencies prescribed by the CSC for officials occupying Division Chief positions and above, and shall apply the Check-and-Stop Method for mapping the leadership competencies of positions within SG 18-23. The required proficiency levels for Leadership competencies shall be as follows:\n\nSalary Grade (SG)\n\nRequired Proficiency Level\n\nSG 18-23\n\nBasic\n\nSG 24\n\nIntermediate\n\nSG 25-27\n\nAdvanced\n\nSG 28\n\nSuperior\n\nNote: Employees with SG 18 or higher who are not in supervisory positions (e.g., Attorney II) shall not be required to manifest leadership competencies.\n\n12. All HRM processes, including recruitment, selection, placement, learning and development, performance management, and rewards and recognition, shall be competency-based to ensure merit-based, objective, and strategic human resource management within the Bureau. TIADCc\n\n13. All policies, guidelines, and processes governing the four (4) core HRM systems \u2014 Recruitment, Selection and Placement; Learning & Development; Performance Management; and Rewards & Recognition \u2014 shall be formulated in alignment with the CSC PRIME-HRM Enhanced Maturity Level Indicators, as outlined in CSC Memorandum Circular No. 24, s. 2016. This ensures the seamless integration of HR processes within the CBHRMS.\n\n14. A BIR CBHRMS Manual shall be developed by the TWG to serve as a guidebook for the implementation of CBHRMS in the Bureau. This manual shall define key concepts, tools, methodologies, processes, forms, and templates necessary for effective implementation. All offices responsible for implementing CBHRMS in the BIR shall be guided by the BIR CBHRMS Manual in ensuring the adoption of the system in its processes.\n\n15. The BIR Competency Model, Competency Dictionary, and Baseline Position Profiles shall be periodically reviewed and updated as necessary to maintain alignment with the Bureau's strategic goals and CSC PRIME-HRM standards. Any enhancements and/or revisions shall require the approval of the Commissioner before implementation.\n\nVI. REPEALING CLAUSE\n\nAll other revenue issuances and/or portion(s) thereof that are inconsistent herewith are hereby revoked and/or amended accordingly.\n\nVII. EFFECTIVITY\n\nThis Order shall take effect immediately.\n\n(SGD.) ROMEO D. LUMAGUI, JR.\nCommissioner of Internal Revenue",

Background. \u2014 Revenue Memorandum Order (RMO) No. 38-2019 was issued to clarify the nature, character, and tax treatment of corporations under Section 30 of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) of 1997, as amended, and to devolve to the Revenue Regions the issuance of the Certificate of Tax Exemption (CTE) to said corporations. HTcADC\n\nThe recent passage of Republic Act No. 12021 or the \"Magna Carta of Filipino Seafarers\" mandated the recognition of exemptions from taxes, duties, and other assessments provided in Article 251 of Presidential Decree No. 442, as amended, enjoyed by legitimate labor organizations of seafarers, without need to apply for confirmation of such exemptions. Additionally, the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of the said law states that in availing of the said exemptions from taxes, duties and other assessments provided, a legitimate labor organization of seafarers shall only be required to submit a certification from the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) to the concerned government agencies that it is included in the register of legitimate labor organizations. Hence, there exists a necessity to amend certain portions of RMO No. 38-2019 to align with the intentions of the said law and its IRR.\n\nSECTION 2. Part V of RMO No. 38-2019 is hereby amended as follows:\n\n\"V. TAXATION OF ORGANIZATIONS AND CORPORATIONS UNDER SEC. 30 OF THE NIRC OF 1997, AS AMENDED\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\nD. Tax Exemption of a legitimate labor organization of seafarers\n\n1) Notwithstanding any provision of a general or special law to the contrary the income and the properties of a legitimate labor organization of seafarers, including grants, endowments, gifts, donations and contributions they may receive from fraternal and similar organizations, local or foreign, which are actually, directly and exclusively used for their lawful purposes, shall be free from taxes, duties and other assessments. The exemptions provided therein may be withdrawn only by a special law expressly repealing the Section 8 (second paragraph) of Republic Act (RA) No. 12021 or the \"Magna Carta of Filipino Seafarers.\"\n\n2) The limitations provided under this Order for income tax exemption, obligation as withholding agents, and liability for VAT or percentage tax shall still apply to a legitimate labor organization of seafarers.\"\n\nSECTION 3. Part VI of RMO No. 38-2019 is hereby amended as follows: CAIHTE\n\n\"VI. GUIDELINES IN THE PROCESSING AND ISSUANCE OF CERTIFICATE OF TAX EXEMPTION OR AVAILMENT OF TAX EXEMPTIONS\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\nC. Documentary Requirements for the availment of tax exemptions by legitimate labor organization of seafarers\n\n1. Legitimate labor organizations of seafarers need to register as a taxpayer at the RDO having jurisdiction with their principal place of business. Since the tax exemptions provided under Article 251 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 442, as amended, or the Labor Code of the Philippines, Section 8 of RA No. 12021 or the \"Magna Carta of Filipino Seafarers,\" and Section 30 of the NIRC, as amended, are granted to a legitimate labor organization as a non-stock, non-profit entity, they do not need to apply for a Certificate of Tax Exemption but they need to submit upon registration the following documents:\n\na. Certified true copy of the latest Articles of Incorporation (AOI) and By-Laws issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The AOI must expressly state the following provisions, to wit:\n\ni. It is a non-stock, non-profit corporation or association;\n\nii. No part of the corporation or association's net income shall inure to the benefit of any private individual;\n\niii. The trustees of the non-profit corporation or association do not receive any compensation or remuneration; and\n\niv. In case of dissolution, its assets shall be distributed to one or more entities formed for the purpose/purposes similar to its own, or to the Philippine government for public purpose.\n\nb. Original Certification under Oath by an executive officer of the corporation or association as to: (i) full description of its past, present, and proposed activities, (ii) the sources and disposition of income, (iii) detailed description of all revenues which it seeks to be exempted from income tax, and (iv) amount of income, compensation, salaries or any emoluments paid by the corporation or association to its trustees, officers and other executive officers. aScITE\n\nc. Legitimate labor organizations of seafarers shall submit a certified true copy of the certification from the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) that it is included in the register of legitimate labor organizations to the RDO where it is registered within sixty (60) days from the effectivity of the IRR of RA No. 12021.\n\n2. Pursuant to Section 8 of RA No. 12021 or the \"Magna Carta of Filipino Seafarers,\" legitimate labor organization of seafarers no longer need to apply for a Certificate of Tax Exemption in order to avail of the tax exemptions provided to them. However, the availment of the said tax exemptions shall be without prejudice to the conduct of post-audit investigation and/or investigation by concerned RDO having jurisdiction over their principal place of business.\n\n3. In order to monitor their status as a legitimate labor organization which is a continuing qualification for their eligibility to the tax exemption provided under Section 8 of RA No. 12021, legitimate labor organizations of seafarers shall attach an updated certified true copy certification from the DOLE that it is still included in the register of legitimate labor organizations when they file their Annual Income Tax Returns.\n\n4. Legitimate labor organization availing of the tax exemptions shall inform the Bureau of the Internal Revenue, through the RDO where they are registered, of the cancellation of their registration with the DOLE and/or non-inclusion in the list of legitimate labor organizations. Noncompliance herewith shall be subjected to penalties under pertinent laws and revenue issuances.\" DETACa\n\nSECTION 4. Part VIII of RMO 38-2019 is hereby amended as follows:\n\n\"VIII. QUARTERLY REPORT ON THE ISSUANCE OF CTEs AND ANNUAL REPORT AVAILMENT OF TAX EXEMPTIONS\n\nAll Regional Directors are required to submit on or before the 20th day of the month following the end of each quarter a Quarterly Summary Report of all CTEs issued to Section 30 corporations together with the copies of the said CTEs to the Audit Information, Tax Exemption and Incentives Division (AITEID), with a copy furnished to the Assistant Commissioner, Legal Service, for a centralized database of issued CTEs.\n\nAll Revenue District Offices shall keep an inventory list or record of all labor organizations registered within their respective jurisdiction availing of the incentives under RA No. 12021 and shall submit the same to the AITEID, with a copy furnished to the Assistant Commissioner, Legal Service, on an annual basis, not later than the 30th of January.\"\n\nSECTION 5. Repealing Clause. \u2014 Any revenue issuance which is inconsistent with Order is deemed revoked, repealed, or modified accordingly.\n\nSECTION 6. Effectivity. \u2014 This Order takes effect immediately and shall be given as wide a publicity as possible.\n\n(SGD.) ROMEO D. LUMAGUI, JR.\nCommissioner of Internal Revenue",

Upon determination that the administrative acts complained of also constitute criminal violation, the IID/RID shall retain certified true copies of the complaint/report and supporting evidence for the conduct of Administrative Investigation, and the Offices of the Assistant Commissioner, Internal Affairs Service (OACIR-IAS)/Regional Director (ORD), upon recommendation by IID/RID, shall endorse the original copies thereof to the Prosecution Division (PD)/Legal Division (LD), for the possible filing of a criminal complaint against any official or employee whether in the active service, has retired, resigned, dropped from the rolls, or has been absent without official leave (AWOL).\n\n3. The PD/LD shall evaluate the supporting evidence. Upon determination that the pieces of evidence are sufficient to establish prima facie evidence with a reasonable certainty of conviction, it shall file and prosecute the criminal cases arising from the administrative cases forwarded/endorsed by the IID/RID against the concerned revenue officials and employees within 15 days from receipt thereof.\n\n4. In case where the concerned official or employee investigated for Grave or Less Grave offense is assigned at the regional office, the concerned Regional Director shall submit to ACIR-IAS the approved RID report of investigation with recommendation whether a prima facie case exist or no further investigation is necessary.\n\n5. All Investigators, Prosecutors, Hearing Officers, Action Attorneys and others concerned shall report thru the Enhanced Monitoring and Managing Administrative Cases (EMMAC) the status or update of all the administrative and criminal cases pursuant to Revenue Memorandum Order (RMO) No. 21-2022.\n\nIV.

                                    "Details": "This Order is issued to realign inconsistencies on some provisions of RMO No. 25-2024 relative to the verification of the creditable withholding taxes claimed by taxpayer claimants, in relation to processing of Tax Credit Certificates or cash refund of excess/unutilized CWT on income under Section 76 (C), in relation to Sections 204 (C) and 229 of the Tax Code. The following amendments are hereby introduced to some provisions and procedures of RMO No. 25-2024. HTcADC\n\nI. Verification of Proof of Payment of Withholding Taxes by Withholding Agents\n\nSection I (6) of RMO No. 25-2024 mentions that no income tax refund shall be granted unless the authenticity and veracity of the BIR Form No. 2307 or 1606, whichever is applicable, is verified without prejudice to establishing whether the withholding tax payments, which is the source of the claimed creditable taxes, have been declared and included in the Alphabetical List of Payees filed by the taxpayer-claimant's respective withholding agents, and that the aforementioned withholding agents have remitted the corresponding amounts to the government.\n\nFor claims of CWT by taxpayer claimants, Republic Act (R.A.) No. 11976, otherwise known as the \"Ease of Paying Taxes (EOPT)\" Act, was enacted with the intention of excluding the proof of payment of taxes withheld by the withholding agents. It is to be emphasized that proof of withholding is incumbent upon the taxpayer claiming for the income tax credit/refund. However, the remittance of such withholding taxes rests upon the withholding agent that withheld such taxes from their purchases from the seller taxpayer-claimant who is claiming the corresponding CWT. It is unfair for the seller taxpayer-claimant to be penalized if indeed the taxes were withheld from its sales to the buyer withholding agent but the latter failed to remit, whether inadvertently or intently, the said taxes withheld. Under our existing rules and regulations, it is the withholding agent who shall be liable for possible administrative and criminal sanctions for such non-remittance. Hence, inclusion of the seller taxpayer-claimant with the indication of the amount so withheld in the Alphabetical List of Payees submitted by the withholding agents in their BIR Form No. 1604-E or 1601-EQ, whichever is applicable, is sufficient proof that the said BIR Form No. 2307 is valid. This procedure is embodied in Sections A (3) to A (5) both of Annexes \"D.1\" and \"D.2\" of RMO No. 25-2024.\n\nHowever, Section A (1) (d) (iv) of Annex \"D.1\" and Section A (1) (c) (iv) of Annex \"D.2\" of RMO No. 25-2024 are not clear whether the BIR Payment Certifications in accordance with the format prescribed under RMO No. 7-2016 is still part of the verification of the claimed CWT by the taxpayer-claimants. CAIHTE\n\nTo eliminate such confusion, Section I (6) of RMO No. 25-2024 is hereby amended to read as follows:\n\n\"I. GENERAL POLICIES\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n6. The burden of proof of withholding is incumbent upon the taxpayer claiming for the income tax credit/refund. No income tax refund shall be granted unless the authenticity and veracity of the BIR Form No. 2307 or BIR Form No. 1606, whichever is applicable, has been verified. To establish such, the following guidelines shall be followed:\n\na. For BIR Form No. 2307, which is the source of the claimed creditable taxes, it must be established that the corresponding withholding tax was declared and included in the Alphabetical List of Payees filed by the taxpayer-claimant's respective withholding agents in the BIR Form No. 1604-E or 1601-EQ, whichever is applicable; and\n\nb. For BIR Form No. 1606, the taxpayer engaged in real estate business claiming for the creditable taxes withheld has filed and remitted the taxes withheld to the government.\"\n\nII. Request for Data/Documents by the Processing Office. Section II (A) (3) (b) (b.2) of RMO No. 25-2024 is hereby amended to read as follows:\n\n\"3. Verification and Reporting. The assigned RO and Group Supervisor (GS) shall process and evaluate the claim based on submitted documents and investigation procedures prescribed in this Order.\n\na. x x x\n\nb. The assigned ROs shall secure/print copies of the documents available at the records/database of the BIR or any other online sources taking into note the following:\n\nb.1 x x x\n\nb.2 For data/documents requested from BIR offices other than the processing office, either manually or electronically, the following rules shall govern:\n\ni. The assigned ROs shall, within 30 days upon official receipt of the application for income tax credit/refund, request for the pertinent document/s from the appropriate BIR Office; and\n\nii. The BIR office where the data/document/s is/are being requested shall furnish the requesting processing office the requested data/document/s within fifteen (15) days from receipt of the such request. Note that this allotted number of days is included in the number of days allotted for the processing office. Hence, BIR offices found to have not complied with the request or have caused the delay in the processing of the income tax refund shall be dealt with pursuant to Section 269(J) of the Tax Code.\" aScITE\n\nIII. Amendments to Annexes \"D.1\" and \"D.2\" of RMO No. 25-2024\n\nIn order to align the procedures in the verification of claims for income tax credit/refund following the preceding amendment to Section I (6) of the said RMO, Annexes \"D.1\" and \"D.2\" of RMO No. 25-2024 are amended, as attached hereto.\n\nIV. Repealing Clause\n\nAll revenue issuances, and BIR Rulings inconsistent herewith are hereby amended, modified or revoked accordingly.\n\nV. Effectivity\n\nThis Order shall take effect immediately and shall cover upcoming and ongoing income tax credit/refund claims being processed by the appropriate processing office(s).\n\n(SGD.)

PROCEDURES\n\n1. The assigned Revenue Officer (RO) shall conduct the following preliminary procedures:\n\na. Ascertain completeness and authenticity of the documentary requirements submitted by the taxpayer-claimant, as check-listed by the RO of the Day. Should there be lacking or deficiencies in the documents submitted, this may cause the denial of the claim, either fully or partially.\n\nb. Familiarize with the business of the taxpayer-claimant and establish the existence and legitimacy of the business. DETACa\n\nc. Ascertain that the taxpayer-claimant is not included in the list of Cannot-Be-Located (CBL) taxpayers.\n\nd.

Only those tax returns filed on or before the filing of the Application for Tax Credit/Refund or the service of the eLA, whichever comes first, shall be considered in the processing of the claim. HEITAD\n\nvi. The assigned ROs may also verify or request other relevant information available in the BIR records.\n\ne. In cases where the authenticity of the documents submitted can be verified electronically or online [e.g., through \"quick-response\" (QR) codes], the assigned evaluator shall attach to the docket, a printout or screenshot of the result of the verification from the facility hosting the electronic/online system/application with the duly-signed notation that the same has been verified through the said system.\n\nf. Analyze the AFS to determine the accounting method of sales and income recognition, accounting period, existence in the asset account of the claimed CWT, and other relevant information.\n\ng. Conduct interviews, where necessary, with responsible and authorized finance, accounting, sales and other personnel to further familiarize with business operations related to sales and purchases, as well as other activities that may relate to the claim.\n\nh. Request for books of accounts and other relevant accounting records, as necessary to determine recording of the claim and reconcile findings and discrepancies noted.\n\n2. Ascertain the legal basis of the claim. The assigned RO shall prepare roll-forward analysis of ITR filed for the current year of claim and succeeding taxable year(s) following Annex \"C.1\". With this, the following can be checked:\n\na. Verify the option selected by the taxpayer-claimant as marked in the AITR, for its excess/unutilized CWT whether tax credit, tax refund or to be carried-over, in compliance with Section 76 of the Tax Code. Once the option to carry-over and apply the said excess quarterly income taxes paid against the income tax due for the taxable quarters of the succeeding taxable years has been made, such option shall be considered IRREVOCABLE for the taxable period and no application for cash refund or issuance of tax credit certificate (TCC) shall be allowed therefor. In case the taxpayer chose the option to be issued TCC or cash refund but inadvertently carried forward the said amount sought to be refunded in the AITR filed for the succeeding taxable year, this shall be a ground for the denial of the claim for tax credit or refund. However, the carried over amount may be allowed as credit against future income tax liabilities of the taxpayer-claimant.\n\nb. Ascertain that the subject claim was not applied against the income tax due during the period of claim. Likewise, examine the ITR for the succeeding quarters/taxable period to ensure that the claim has not been carried over and offset against subsequent income tax liabilities. aDSIHc\n\nc. Ascertain that the subject claim pertains to unutilized CWT for the current taxable year only. The excess CWT from prior years may be applied against the current year's income tax due, provided that the prior year's excess credit/s are properly documented or verified from the previous audit.\n\n3. Establish that the tax credit/refund claim adheres to the requisites under Section 76 (C) of the Tax Code:\n\na. Ascertain that the claim is filed within the 2-year prescriptive period from the date of filing the return pursuant to Section 204 (C) of the Tax Code. Note that a return filed showing an overpayment shall be considered as a written claim for tax credit/refund. In this regard, for purposes of the 180-day processing period, the counting shall commence upon submission of complete documents in support of the application that will be prescribed by the BIR for this purpose which should be within the 2-year prescriptive period.\n\nb. The income upon which the taxes were withheld must be included as part of the gross income declared in the AITR of the recipient. The following rules shall govern upon comparing the aggregate amounts of the submitted BIR Form No. 2307/1606 and the summary of revenues/income declared per AITR:\n\ni. The taxpayer-claimant must be clearly identified as the payee in the withholding tax certificate.\n\nii. If the income aggregate taxes withheld by a certain withholding agent per submitted BIR Form No. 2307/1606 is equal to the computed withholding taxes in the summary of revenues/income declared per AITR, allow the CWT claimed.\n\niii. If the aggregate taxes withheld by a certain withholding agent per submitted BIR Form No. 2307/1606 is less than the computed withholding taxes in the summary of revenues/income declared per AITR, allow the variance. This could possibly be a timing difference or failure of the withholding agent to withhold the remaining amount.\n\niv. If the aggregate taxes withheld by a certain withholding agent per submitted BIR Form No. 2307/1606 is higher than the summary of revenues/income declared per AITR, disallow the variance. The corresponding income tax due from the difference of the income payments declared by the withholding agent and the aggregate sales per SAWT shall be assessed and may be deducted from the amount sought to be refunded/credited or incorporated to the on-going audit of all internal revenue taxes for possible collection of the deficiency taxes due, including Value-Added Tax (VAT), if any.\n\nv. If the withholding agent appearing on the BIR Form No. 2307/1606 does not appear on the summary of revenues/income declared per AITR of the taxpayer-claimant for the taxable year covered by the claim, do not allow the amount of CWT claimed and the corresponding income tax due shall be assessed and may be deducted from the amount sought to be refunded/credited or incorporated to the on-going audit of all internal revenue taxes for possible collection of the deficiency taxes due, including Value-Added Tax (VAT), if any. ATICcS\n\nc. The fact of withholding is established by a copy of the withholding tax certificate duly issued by the payor (withholding agent) to the payee showing the amount of income payment and the amount of tax withheld. Proof of withholding is incumbent upon the taxpayer claiming for the income tax credit/refund. No income tax refund shall be granted unless the authenticity and veracity of the BIR Form No. 2307/1606 is verified. The following rules shall govern upon comparing the CWT Claimed per SAWT and the Alphalist of payees as attached in the BIR Form No. 1604E submitted by the withholding agents of the taxpayer-claimant (the assigned ROs may also utilize the withholding agent's quarterly Alphalist of Payees):\n\ni. If the CWT claimed per SAWT is equal to the taxes withheld appearing on the Alphalist in the BIR Form No. 1604E submitted by the withholding agent, allow the CWT claimed.\n\nii. If the CWT claimed per BIR Form No. 2307/1606/SAWT is less than the taxes withheld appearing on the Alphalist in the BIR Form No. 1604E submitted by the withholding agent, allow the CWT claimed therefrom but investigate further if the variance is an under-declaration of sales that would warrant deficiency tax assessments.\n\niii. If the CWT claimed per SAWT is more than the taxes withheld appearing on the Alphalist in the BIR Form No. 1604E submitted by the withholding agent, disallow the variance.\n\niv. If upon verification, there appears creditable taxes withheld by a withholding agent but the taxpayer claimant failed to declare or claim the corresponding CWT therefrom including declaring the same in its AITR for the taxable year covered by the claim, do not allow the amount of CWT appearing on the alphalist and the corresponding income tax due shall be assessed and may be deducted from the amount sought to be refunded/credited or incorporated to the on-going audit of all internal revenue taxes for possible collection of the deficiency taxes due, including Value-Added Tax (VAT), if any.\n\n4. For items 3 (b) and 3 (c), the assigned ROs shall prepare a comparative matrix of CWT claimed following the pro-forma matrix marked as Annex \"C.2\" of this Order. The assigned RO shall only allow the lowest amount between the aggregate amounts claimed per BIR Form No. 2307/1606, SAWT per AITR, Alphalist of Payees submitted by the withholding agents of the taxpayer claimant, etc. If the disallowance exceeds the amount sought to be refunded, recommend for denial and assess the deficiency tax due. The said lists are not exclusive as the assigned RO may also find other findings other than the above enumerations. ETHIDa\n\n5. The assigned RO/s shall endorse the BIR Form No. 1604E filed by the withholding agents of the taxpayer-claimant to their respective RDOs or LTADs/LTDOs that have jurisdiction over the withholding agent for checking as to whether or not the said withholding taxes are indeed remitted to the BIR. Processing of the claim shall proceed accordingly without awaiting the result of the checking of the RDO or LTAD/LTDO that has jurisdiction over the withholding agent. If found later that the withholding agent did not remit the taxes withheld, it is upon the RDO or LTAD/LTDO to enforce the collection of the said unremitted taxes withheld.\n\n6. In the course of the verification of claim, the RO with the approval of the head of the processing office and upon recommendation of the GS, shall:\n\na. Recommend deduction from the claim such amount that may lead to the disallowance of the CWT claimed;\n\nb. Inasmuch as a separate eLA is simultaneously handed by the same RO, any findings that may result in deficiency assessment of internal revenue taxes shall be incorporated to the results of investigation under the said eLA; and\n\nc. If the taxpayer has a tax liability, the processing Office, shall notify the Collection Section of the Revenue District Office and/or Collection Division of the Revenue Region or the LT-Collection and Enforcement Division (LTCED) having jurisdiction over the taxpayer-claimant, of the approved VAT refund which may be used or garnished by the BIR to collect either fully or partially for the outstanding delinquent tax liability of the taxpayer-claimant, subject to existing tax laws and revenue issuances on the enforcement and settlement of delinquent accounts.\n\nB.

                                    "Details": "I. BACKGROUND\n\nAs part of the BIR's initiative to achieve the highest level of recognition in the Civil Service Commission's Program to Institutionalize Meritocracy and Excellence in Human Resource Management (CSC PRIME-HRM), the Human Resource Development Service (HRDS) has developed and integrated a Competency-based Human Resource Management System (CBHRMS) into its four (4) core HRM systems: Recruitment, Selection and Placement; Learning and Development; Performance Management; and Rewards & Recognition. The development and implementation of CBHRMS align with the PRIME-HRM Enhanced Maturity Level Indicators, as specified in CSC Memorandum Circular (MC) No. 24, s. 2016, to ensure that BIR's HRM practices meet the highest standards of excellence, professionalism, and institutionalization. HTcADC\n\nTo support this, BIR has moved from a process-defined HRM approach to a competency-based approach, involving identification and development of knowledge, skills, and attitudes (competencies) needed for success. This transition can be achieved through training, skill building, learning interventions, and improved workforce planning and hiring practices. Ultimately, leading to improved job performance and satisfaction. This shifts the focus from processes to the capabilities of individuals and how they contribute to organizational goals.\n\nCBHRMS is beneficial both to the employees and the management as it offers a standard structure for recruitment, selection and placement, learning and development, work expectations, performance evaluation, career advancement paths, and rewards and recognition. It minimizes personal bias and subjectivity in hiring and promotion decisions, ensuring that employees are well-suited for their roles. Furthermore, the appropriate learning and development interventions/programs will be designed, developed, implemented, and evaluated within the right time frame to help employees achieve the required competency levels for career pathing and succession planning. By following the standards implemented through CBHRMS, employees receive the necessary support, training, capability-building interventions, and career development opportunities to achieve their performance goals while contributing to the Bureau's mission of delivering efficient and effective public service.\n\nII. OBJECTIVES\n\nThis Order is issued to: CAIHTE\n\n1. Discuss the theory and best practices of competency modeling, identification, and assessment as a foundation for the four (4) core pillars of PRIME-HRM: Recruitment, Selection and Placement, Learning and Development, Performance Management, and Rewards & Recognition; and\n\n2. Prescribe policies for the effective implementation of CBHRMS in the BIR to ensure a consistent, competency-based approach across all HRM systems.\n\nIII. SCOPE AND COVERAGE\n\nThis Order shall apply to:\n\n1. All BIR employees involved in the processes of recruitment, selection, placement, performance management, learning and development, and rewards and recognition;\n\n2. All four (4) core human resource management systems: Recruitment, Selection, and Placement; Learning and development; Performance Management; and Rewards and Recognition;\n\n3. Workforce planning, career and competency development, and succession planning initiatives within the Bureau; and\n\n4. All BIR employees, regardless of position or salary grade, across all offices within the Bureau, to ensure that they consistently demonstrate the required competencies for the effective performance of their duties and responsibilities.\n\nIV. DEFINITION OF TERMS\n\n1. Baseline Position Profile \u2014 provides a detailed list of competencies and proficiency levels required for each position to ensure relevance, clarity, consistency, and fairness in job expectations and performance evaluations across the Bureau.\n\n2. Behavioral Indicators \u2014 demonstrated actions that indicate the presence of competency (knowledge, skills, attitudes and other attributes) at a particular proficiency level.\n\n3. Check-and-Stop Method \u2014 is a competency mapping technique in which functional competency is assessed for its relevance and applicability to a specific position. This method is also used for the leadership competencies of SG18-23 positions.\n\n4. Competency \u2014 defined as observable and measurable complement of knowledge, skills, and attitudes essential for successful job performance. aScITE\n\n5. Competency Definition \u2014 a clear and concise description of competency and its importance within the BIR context.\n\n6. Competency Dictionary \u2014 the official reference document defining the competencies required within the BIR. It contains detailed competency tables for each identified competency.\n\n7. Competency Framework \u2014 blueprint of the design, development, implementation, integration, monitoring, evaluation, and assessment of the CBHRMS for the BIR.\n\n8. Competency Mapping/Profiling \u2014 the process of identifying the required competencies and proficiency levels for each position to create a standardized baseline position profile within the Bureau.\n\n9. Competency Modeling \u2014 the process of identifying and defining the knowledge, skills, and attitudes required within the BIR. It is a framework that helps agencies align their human resource management practices with their strategic goals.\n\n10. Competency Table \u2014 a structured outline consisting of the competency cluster, competency definition, rubrics/4-proficiency levels and descriptions, and behavioral indicators of each competency to provide understanding of how a particular competency is demonstrated.\n\n11. Core Competencies \u2014 fundamental knowledge, skills, and attitudes required for all BIR employees, regardless of their function or role.\n\n12. Cluster code \u2014 represents the identification of the competencies based on Core (e.g., C1, C2, C3 . . .), Leadership (e.g., L1, L2, L3 . . .), and Functional (e.g., F1, F2, F3 . . .) classifications.\n\n13. Floor-and-Ceiling Method \u2014 is a competency mapping technique in which a specific proficiency level for each of the core competency is mapped across a range of positions \u2014 from the lowest (floor) to the highest (ceiling) salary grades or position levels.\n\n14. Functional Competencies \u2014 job-specific skills and technical knowledge required to perform duties effectively. These competencies vary depending on the employee's function or role.\n\n15. Leadership Competencies \u2014 competencies essential for officials and employees in leadership and management roles, including those in the pipeline for succession planning.\n\n16. Proficiency levels or competency levels \u2014 refer to a scale that outlines varying levels of progression for each competency. These levels reflect the increasing depth of expertise, responsibility, and complexity expected at different salary grades or job positions.\n\n17. Rubric \u2014 refers to the explicit criteria that tells \"what counts\" in assessing demonstration of the competencies. DETACa\n\n18. Rubric description \u2014 serves as reference in determining behavioral indicators.\n\nV. POLICIES\n\n1. Competencies shall refer to the integrated set of knowledge, skills, and attitudes that all employees are expected to demonstrate in the effective fulfillment of their roles and responsibilities. These competencies are anchored on the BIR's vision and mission, core values, strategy map, and mandate. All BIR employees are required to develop, apply, and continuously enhance these competencies to meet established performance expectations, support organizational goals, and uphold the standards of excellence in public service.\n\n2. The Competency Model and Profiles shall align with the standards set by the CSC PRIME-HRM Maturity Level 3, which emphasizes the integration of CBHRMS into the key areas of human resource management. This model ensures that employee competencies are aligned with the Bureau's organizational anchors, i.e., mission, vision, core values, strategic goals and directions, equipping personnel with the essential knowledge, skills, and attitudes for effective job performance. Competency modeling and job profiling will provide a platform for more objective, fair, and defensible human resource management processes for the Bureau.\n\nThe Competency Modeling shall consist of the following three (3) components:\n\na. Competency Framework\n\nb. Competency Model\n\nc. Competency Dictionary\n\n3. The CBHRMS Framework, as shown below, shall serve as the blueprint of the Bureau's journey towards institutionalizing meritocracy and excellence in delivering public service. It shall guide the Bureau in integrating the competency-based principles into its human resource management policies, practices, and processes to ensure a strategic, consistent, and objective approach to workforce development.\n\nThe framework is represented as a wheel, with the Bureau's competency clusters and functional group forming its structure. At the center is the BIR logo, symbolizing the agency's mandate, aspiration, mission, and core values, which serve as the foundation of the Bureau's competency journey. The middle blue gradient layer represents the five functional groups: Office of the Commissioner (OCIR), Legal Group (LG), Information Systems Group (ISG), Resource Management Group (RMG), and Operations Group (OG). Surrounding these functional groups are the competencies represented by a color derived from the BIR logo and the Philippine flag, and clustered into Core, Leadership, and Functional competencies. This framework reflects the BIR's cohesiveness, with its workforce moving as one towards service excellence. HEITAD\n\n4. The BIR Competency Model, represented by Competency Tables, shall be composed of the following elements:\n\na. Competency Name identified from the organizational anchors\n\nb. Competency Definition aligned with the determined Competency Cluster\n\nc. Rubrics/4-proficiency levels and Descriptions of each level per competency that are aligned with the competency definition\n\nd. Behavioral Indicators per rubric/proficiency level aligned with respective level description\n\n5. The BIR shall adopt a systematic and strategic approach in identifying competencies to ensure alignment with its organizational mandate, strategic direction, and performance standards. The following processes and approaches shall be observed:\n\na. Competency identification shall align with the BIR's vision, mission, and core values to ensure employees support the agency's purpose and direction.\n\nb. The BIR's organizational structure shall be reviewed to establish a clear understanding of job roles and responsibilities, forming the basis for determining required competencies.\n\nc. Existing job descriptions and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) shall be analyzed to identify the specific knowledge, skills, and attitudes contributing to high performance in each role. aDSIHc\n\nd. The BIR's strategy map and Major Final Outputs (MFOs) shall be utilized to determine the competencies necessary for delivering strategic priorities and achieving key organizational outcomes.\n\ne. Competencies shall be benchmarked against best practices from other government agencies to guide the selection of relevant competencies.\n\n6. Competencies shall be defined using the following elements:\n\na. Competency name \u2014 Reflects the complement of knowledge, skills, and attitude manifested through observable behaviors.\n\nb. Competency definition \u2014 Includes a behavioral action word, describes how the work is performed, indicates output aligned with the BIR's strategic goals, and highlights the expected quality of outcomes.\n\nc. Rubrics/4-Proficiency levels and Description \u2014 Each competency shall be further defined using rubrics across four (4) proficiency levels: Basic (Level 1), Intermediate (Level 2), Advanced (Level 3), and Superior (Level 4). These levels shall reflect the depth of expertise, responsibility, and complexity expected at different salary grades or job positions. Progression through these levels shall be guided by the following dimensions:\n\ni. Intensity \u2014 Degree of involvement or completeness of action\n\nii. Vertical Complexity \u2014 Considering more people, data, figures, concepts, ideas, etc. into account\n\niii. Horizontal Complexity \u2014 Ranging from simple and routine to highly intricate or complex\n\niv. Scope \u2014 Similar tasks in a narrow environment to increased tasks in a broad environment\n\nv. Time horizon \u2014 Action planning on anticipated future situation\n\nvi. Breadth of impact \u2014 Number of positions or people or job groups affected\n\nvii. Autonomy \u2014 Degree of supervision or level of decision-making power\n\nviii. Context \u2014 From a narrowly defined work environment to multiple or wide variety of work environments\n\nd. Behavioral indicators \u2014 At each rubric/proficiency level, specific behavioral indicators shall be defined to describe how competency is demonstrated. These indicators must be observable, measurable, verifiable, and capable of being developed through training or other capacity-building interventions. Each behavioral indicator shall include a behavioral action word, object of the action, and the corresponding attribute or expected output. ATICcS\n\n7. The BIR shall maintain a Competency Dictionary (Annex A), which shall serve as the official, standardized reference tool for the Bureau's human resource management and organizational development initiatives. The Competency Dictionary consists of seventy-two (72) competencies, categorized as follows:\n\na. Core Competencies (8 competencies) \u2014 Applicable to all positions within the Bureau; when identifying core competencies, the Build Approach (as against Buy/Borrow, Borrow-and-Modify, or Buy-and-Modify), is the most appropriate since the organization is a unique entity that exists in a specific environment. The process of identifying core competencies for the BIR begins with a review of its culture, mission, aspiration, values, and strategic goals.\n\nb. Leadership Competencies (6 competencies) \u2014 Applicable to leadership or managerial positions. In identifying competencies of managers/leaders of the organization the Competency Menu Method can be a good option because of the many well-researched management and leadership competency models that are available. The BIR developed one leadership competency (L1) and adopted five (5) additional leadership competencies (L2-L6) from the CSC pursuant to CSC MC No. 05, s. 2016; and\n\nc. Functional Competencies (58 competencies) \u2014 Specific to job roles or offices based on technical or operational requirements. For technical or functional competencies, all approaches to competency modelling (Buy, Buy-and-Modify, Borrow-and-Modify, and Build) may be used. The Build Approach, however, is still the best way to develop a competency model (for the BIR) that responds precisely to the needs of the Bureau.\n\nThe Competency Dictionary shall be utilized for the following purposes:\n\na. Identifying and mapping competencies required for specific positions;\n\nb. Developing competency-based job descriptions for all positions within the Bureau;\n\nc. Guiding assessment of candidates through competency-based interviews and selection tools and techniques;\n\nd. Assessing employee's current competency levels to support career and competency development, succession planning, and performance management; and\n\ne. Designing, developing, and implementing competency-based learning and development programs tailored to the Bureau's needs. ETHIDa\n\n8. The BIR shall establish a Baseline Position Profile (Annex B) outlining the required competencies and corresponding proficiency levels for each plantilla position within the Bureau. The following techniques shall be employed in mapping the competency requirements for each position:\n\na. Floor-and-Ceiling Method \u2014 a specific proficiency level is mapped across a range of positions \u2014 from the lowest (floor) to the highest (ceiling) salary grades or position levels. This method ensures consistent competency expectations across all job levels.\n\nb. Check-and-Stop Method \u2014 a competency is assessed for its relevance and applicability to a specific position. The process involves reviewing the competency definition and its behavioral indicators, checking those that align with the position's duties and responsibilities, and stopping when a behavioral indicator is no longer relevant. This method ensures that only applicable competencies are assigned, resulting in a focused and role-specific competency profile.\n\n9. The Floor-and-Ceiling Method shall be used to map the Core Competencies. The required proficiency levels for Core Competencies shall be as follows:\n\nSalary Grade (SG)\n\nRequired Proficiency Level\n\nSG 2-14\n\nBasic\n\nSG 15-18\n\nIntermediate\n\nSG 19-24\n\nAdvanced\n\nSG 25 & above\n\nSuperior\n\n10. For Functional competencies, the Head of Office shall be responsible for identifying and mapping the required competencies and proficiency levels for each position within their respective offices, using the Check-and-Stop Method. This process shall be based on the defined roles, responsibilities, and functional requirements of the position.\n\n11. The BIR shall adopt the leadership competencies prescribed by the CSC for officials occupying Division Chief positions and above, and shall apply the Check-and-Stop Method for mapping the leadership competencies of positions within SG 18-23. The required proficiency levels for Leadership competencies shall be as follows:\n\nSalary Grade (SG)\n\nRequired Proficiency Level\n\nSG 18-23\n\nBasic\n\nSG 24\n\nIntermediate\n\nSG 25-27\n\nAdvanced\n\nSG 28\n\nSuperior\n\nNote: Employees with SG 18 or higher who are not in supervisory positions (e.g., Attorney II) shall not be required to manifest leadership competencies.\n\n12. All HRM processes, including recruitment, selection, placement, learning and development, performance management, and rewards and recognition, shall be competency-based to ensure merit-based, objective, and strategic human resource management within the Bureau. TIADCc\n\n13. All policies, guidelines, and processes governing the four (4) core HRM systems \u2014 Recruitment, Selection and Placement; Learning & Development; Performance Management; and Rewards & Recognition \u2014 shall be formulated in alignment with the CSC PRIME-HRM Enhanced Maturity Level Indicators, as outlined in CSC Memorandum Circular No. 24, s. 2016. This ensures the seamless integration of HR processes within the CBHRMS.\n\n14. A BIR CBHRMS Manual shall be developed by the TWG to serve as a guidebook for the implementation of CBHRMS in the Bureau. This manual shall define key concepts, tools, methodologies, processes, forms, and templates necessary for effective implementation. All offices responsible for implementing CBHRMS in the BIR shall be guided by the BIR CBHRMS Manual in ensuring the adoption of the system in its processes.\n\n15. The BIR Competency Model, Competency Dictionary, and Baseline Position Profiles shall be periodically reviewed and updated as necessary to maintain alignment with the Bureau's strategic goals and CSC PRIME-HRM standards. Any enhancements and/or revisions shall require the approval of the Commissioner before implementation.\n\nVI. REPEALING CLAUSE\n\nAll other revenue issuances and/or portion(s) thereof that are inconsistent herewith are hereby revoked and/or amended accordingly.\n\nVII. EFFECTIVITY\n\nThis Order shall take effect immediately.\n\n(SGD.) ROMEO D. LUMAGUI, JR.\nCommissioner of Internal Revenue",
