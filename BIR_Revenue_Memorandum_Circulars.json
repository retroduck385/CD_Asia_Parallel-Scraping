BACKGROUND\n\nThis Circular is issued to provide clarification on whether or not there still a need for the REE-buyer to provide a sworn declaration stating that the goods and/or services are directly and exclusively used for the production of goods and/or completion of services to be exported, among others, to its local supplier for the latter's documentation in case of post-audit by the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR), as required under Revenue Memorandum Circular (RMC) No. 80-2023 for the availment of the zero percent (0%) VAT rate on local purchase of goods and services.\n\nParagraph 2, Section 4.106-5 (c) of Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 16-2005, as amended by RR No. 10-2025, states that the \"VAT zero-rating on local purchases of goods shall be availed of on the basis of the VAT zero-rating certification issued by the concerned IPA, without prejudice, however, to the conduct of post audit investigation/verification by the BIR that the goods are indeed directly attributable to the registered project or activity of the qualified RBEs.\" CAIHTE\n\nSimilarly, Paragraph 4, Section 4.108-5 (b) (8) of the above cited RR states that the \"VAT zero-rating on local purchases of services shall be availed of on the basis of the VAT zero-rating certification issued by the concerned IPA, without prejudice, however, to the conduct of post audit investigation/verification by the BIR that the services are directly attributable to the registered project or activity of the qualified RBEs.\"\n\nII. CLARIFICATION\n\nIn light of the issuance of RR No. 10-2025, it is clarified that the submission of a sworn declaration by the RBE-buyer is no longer required to avail of the zero percent (0%) VAT rate. The VAT Zero-Rate Certificate issued by the concerned Investment Promotion Agency (IPA) shall serve as the primary documentary basis for such availment. This is without prejudice to the BIR's authority to conduct post-audit verification to ensure that the purchases are directly attributable to the registered project or activity of the qualified RBE.\n\nIII. REPEALING CLAUSE\n\nAll revenue issuances and BIR Rulings inconsistent herewith are hereby amended, modified or revoked accordingly. aScITE\n\nIV. EFFECTIVITY CLAUSE\n\nThis Circular shall take effect from the passage of Republic Act No. 12066, commonly known as the CREATE MORE Act.\n\nAll internal revenue officials, employees and others concerned are hereby enjoined to give this Circular as wide a publicity as possible.\n\nROMEO D.

Manual Books of Accounts; or\n\n2. Loose-Leaf Books of Accounts (LLBA); or\n\n3. Computerized Books of Accounts (CBA).\n\nTo clarify, taxpayers who opt to use LLBA and CBA are not required to register Manual Books of Accounts. However, they are required to secure a Permit to Use (PTU) Loose-Leaf Books of Accounts or Acknowledgement Certificate (AC) for CBA or Computerized Accounting System (CAS) before use. These permits can only be issued after a TIN has been issued. Therefore, the registration of LLBA or CBA cannot be processed simultaneously with the issuance of TIN. Once the TIN and required permits have been issued, the BIR Registration Officer may update the taxpayer's record to reflect the registration of LLBA or CBA.\n\nThe registration period of Manual Books of Accounts, LLBA and CBA is prescribed under Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 3-2023 and is not mandatory during business registration. Taxpayers who opt to use LLBA or CBA shall be liable for failure to make entries or recordings upon commencement of business operations, without approved PTU or AC.\n\nAll concerned are hereby enjoined to give this Circular as wide a publicity as possible.\n\nROMEO D.

The NRDSPs are still required to file tax returns with the BIR to report their B2B transactions. This will enable the BIR to collect information on the total digital services transactions in the Philippines by NRDSPs which are needed for accurate monitoring and analysis of the digital economy, ensuring compliance with tax regulations, and facilitating effective policy-making and revenue collection.\n\nQ3: How will NRDSPs register with the BIR?\n\nA3: The NRDSPs shall register with the BIR through the VAT on Digital Services (VDS) Portal once it is available.\n\nPrior to the VDS Portal roll-out, the NRDSPs or their appointed resident third-party service providers shall register through the Online Registration and Update System (ORUS), which is available in the BIR official website (https://www.bir.gov.ph/eServices).

Name of business entity, including trade name;\n\n2. Name of the authorized representative, and Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) in case of local authorized representative, responsible for tax administration, if any;\n\n3. Registered foreign address; and\n\n4. Contact information of the NRDSP (e.g., Contact number, email address).\n\nQ6: What are the documentary requirements for the registration of NRDSPs?\n\nA6: Any official registration document issued by an authorized government regulatory body (e.g., Securities and Exchange Commission, tax authority) in the country where NRDSP was incorporated or organized (e.g., Articles of Incorporation, Certificate of Tax Residency) that includes the name of the NRDSP shall be sufficient for the registration.\n\nQ7: Do NRDSPs need to have a local representative in the Philippines to register with the BIR?\n\nA7: No. NRDSPs do not need a local representative in the Philippines to register with the BIR. However, an NRDSP may appoint a resident third-party service provider (an individual or entity, such as a law firm or accounting firm) for purposes of registration, filing of tax return and payment of taxes, receiving notices, record keeping, and other reporting obligations.\n\nQ8: In case of NRDSPs with local representative that opt to manually register with the BIR, where do they register?\n\nA8: NRDSPs with local representative may manually register with BIR Revenue District Office No. 39-South Quezon City.\n\nQ9: Will the appointment of a resident third-party service provider classify the NRDSP as a resident foreign corporation doing business in the Philippines?\n\nA9: No. For VAT purposes, the appointment of a resident third-party service provider shall not classify the NRDSP as a resident foreign corporation doing business in the Philippines. aScITE\n\nQ10: What document shall be issued to an NRDSP as proof of its registration with the BIR?\n\nA10: A BIR Certificate of Registration (COR)/BIR Form No. 2303 containing the assigned TIN and other registration details shall be issued to the NRDSP, which shall be used in the filing of VAT returns, and remittance of VAT, if any, to the BIR.\n\nQ11: What tax type will the NRDSPs be registered and liable for?\n\nA11:  NRDSPs will be registered and liable for payment of the 12% VAT on their gross sales from the supply and delivery of digital services consumed or used in the Philippines. During registration, the NRDSP shall select VAT as its tax type.\n\nQ12: Will there be any penalty imposed in case an NRDSP fails to register with the BIR for VAT?\n\nA12: Yes. An NRDSP which fails to register for VAT shall be imposed with applicable penalties under Section 13 of RR No. 3-2025, and suspension of its business operations under Section 12 of the same Regulations, if warranted.\n\nQ13: What is the VAT treatment for cross-border B2B transactions?\n\nA13: In B2B transactions where the NRDSPs provide digital services to Philippine consumer/buyer engaged in business, including the Government or any of its political subdivisions, instrumentalities or agencies, including GOCCs, the Philippine consumer/buyer will account for the VAT using the reverse charge mechanism.\n\nAs such, the Philippine consumer/buyer shall be liable for: (i) electronically filing the required remittance return; and (ii) withholding and remitting the twelve percent (12%) VAT due on its purchase, as shown below:\n\nIllustration: B2B Transaction\n\nQ14: What is the VAT treatment for cross-border B2C transactions?\n\nA14: In a B2C transaction where the consumer/buyer is not engaged in business, the NRDSP shall be directly liable for: (i) electronically filing the VAT return; and (ii) paying the VAT due thereon through the simplified pay-only regime in the VDS Portal based on its gross sales relating to the sale of Digital Services consumed/used in the Philippines. DETACa\n\nIllustration: B2C Transaction\n\nQ15: What is the VAT treatment for digital services that go through an online marketplace or e-marketplace?\n\nA15: For a DSP acting as an online marketplace or e-marketplace on the transactions of resident and non-resident sellers or suppliers that go through its platform, the following mechanisms shall be observed, provided that it controls the key aspects of the supply and performs any of the following:\n\n\u2022 it sets directly or indirectly any of the terms and conditions under which the supply of digital services is made; or\n\n\u2022 it is involved in the ordering or delivery of digital services whether directly or indirectly. HEITAD\n\nIllustration 1: DSP Acting as Non-Resident Online Marketplace or E-Marketplace for a B2B Transaction\n\nIllustration 2: DSP Acting as Non-Resident Online Marketplace or E-Marketplace for a B2C Transaction\n\nIllustration 3: DSP Acting as Resident Online Marketplace or E-Marketplace for B2B and B2C Transactions\n\nQ16: What is the invoicing requirement for NRDSPs?\n\nA16: There is no prescribed form of an invoice for NRDSPs as long as the mandatory information under the law is present, which are as follows: aDSIHc\n\n(1) Date of the transaction;\n\n(2) Transaction Reference Number;\n\n(3) Identification of the consumer (including the TIN for B2B);\n\n(4) Brief description of the transaction; and\n\n(5) The total amount with the indication that such amount includes the VAT.\n\nSample Illustration of an Invoice\n\nFor B2B supply of digital services made by a VAT-registered NRDSP, the obligation for assessing and remitting the 12% VAT shall be the responsibility of the Philippine business consumer/buyer. The VAT amount must be clearly stated on the invoice. However, if the NRDSP is unable to include the VAT amount on the invoice, it must include a footnote/annotation on the invoice indicating that the Philippine business consumer/buyer is responsible for accounting and remitting the 12% VAT due on the transaction to the BIR, as shown in the illustration below: ATICcS\n\nQ17: When will the NRDSPs be subject to VAT under RA No. 12023?\n\nA17: The NRDSP shall be immediately subject to VAT after one hundred twenty (120) days from the effectivity of the RR No. 3-2025, or starting June 2, 2025.\n\nQ18: What BIR Form shall the NRDSP and its B2B consumer/buyer use in filing and payment/remittance of the VAT?\n\nA18: For B2B and B2C transactions, the NRDSP shall use BIR Form No. 2550-DS in filing the VAT return (for B2B and B2C transactions) and/or payment/remittance of the VAT due thereon (for B2C transactions), which shall be available and generated in the VDS Portal. ETHIDa\n\nIn B2B transactions, the business consumer/buyer, whether VAT or non-VAT registered, shall use BIR Form No. 1600-VT in filing and remittance of the withheld VAT from the NRDSP.\n\nQ19: Can NRDSPs claim input tax?\n\nA19: No. As provided under Section 7 (B) of RR No. 3-2025, non-resident VAT-registered DSPs shall not be allowed to claim creditable input tax.\n\nQ20: If after the payment of VAT, the NRDSP later discovered that its Philippine consumer/buyer is engaged in business and the corresponding withholding VAT was already paid to the BIR by the latter, can the NRDSP apply for refund of erroneously paid VAT?\n\nA20: No. The NRDSP cannot file for refund of the erroneously paid VAT. However, the NRDSP may amend the previously filed BIR Form No. 2550-DS to reflect the overpayment which may be carried-over to the succeeding quarter/s.\n\nQ21: When an NRDSP generates sales through an e-marketplace but the payment for the digital service is made directly to the account of the NRDSP, is the e-marketplace liable for the VAT?\n\nA21: No. The e-marketplace is not liable to pay the VAT because the payment for the digital service is made directly to the account of the NRDSP and thus, not within the control of the e-marketplace. However, the service fee charged by the marketplace to the consumer/buyer located in the Philippines, if any, shall be subject to VAT. TIADCc\n\nQ22: When digital services are utilized for the purchase of physical goods through an online marketplace and a separate service fee is charged by the online marketplace for the use or availment of the digital service, should VAT be imposed on the separate fee for the digital service?\n\nA22: Yes. Although RR No. 3-2025 excludes the sale, supply or delivery of physical goods \u2014 since these are already subject to customs, duties, taxes, and other charges by the Bureau of Customs \u2014 the separate service fee for using or availing of the online platform/marketplace, which is classified as digital service under RA No. 12023, remains subject to VAT when said service fee has been charged to a consumer/buyer located in the Philippines.\n\nQ23: Does RA No. 12023 apply to services other than digital services?\n\nA23: Only digital services as defined under RA No. 12023 shall be subject to VAT under the said law. Under RA No. 12023, digital services refer to any service that is supplied over the internet or other electronic network with the use of information technology and where the supply of the service is essentially automated. It shall include, but not limited to:\n\n(1) Online search engine;\n\n(2) Online marketplace or e-marketplace;\n\n(3) Cloud service;\n\n(4) Online media and advertising;\n\n(5) Online platform; or\n\n(6) Digital goods.\n\nQ24: Company ABC is a resident VAT-registered company which operates a teleconsultation platform where appointments are booked through a website, applications, or e-marketplace. Virtual meetings via video or call conferences allow doctors and patients to engage in real-time discussions, providing and receiving essential medical assessments, diagnoses, treatments, and ongoing support. Are the services being rendered by Company ABC subject to VAT?\n\nA24: Yes. This falls within the definition of Digital Services under Section 3 (A) under RR No. 3-2025 particularly under \"online consultations through a digital platform (i.e., website, applications, e-marketplace)\" since the medical consultation cannot be booked, completed and/or delivered without the use of information technology. cSEDTC\n\nAs an online platform, it shall be subject to VAT provided that the conditions under Q15 and A15 above are complied with.\n\nQ25: Is there a need to secure a Certificate of Tax Exemption from the BIR to support the claim for VAT-Exemption on the sale of online subscription-based services to educational institutions accredited by the Department of Education (DepEd), Commission on Higher Education (CHED), and Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA)?\n\nA25: No. For the sale of online subscription-based services to educational institutions, it shall only present to the DSP the accreditation/recognition from DepEd, CHED and TESDA, as the case may be, in order to avail of the VAT exemption.\n\nQ26: Are digital services rendered by NRDSPs to Registered Business Enterprises (RBEs) with Certification issued by Investment Promotion Agencies (IPAs) or to the export oriented enterprises (EOEs) covered under Sections 106 and 108 of the Tax Code, where such digital services provided are directly attributable to the registered activity or project of the RBEs or to the export activities of the EOEs under RA No. 12066, subject to 12% VAT under RA No. 12023?\n\nA26:  No. If the digital services rendered by NRDSPs are directly attributable (1) to the registered business activity/project of the IPA-registered entity, classified as registered export enterprise, high-value domestic market enterprise or domestic market enterprise under transitory provision of RA No. 12066 or (2) to the export activity of the EOE, they are eligible for VAT exemption.\n\nQ27: How can an NRDSP verify whether or not a buyer is engaged in business for VAT purposes under RA No. 12023 and RR No. 3-2025?\n\nA27: An NRDSP can verify if a buyer is engaged in business by obtaining the buyer's TIN and by providing a questionnaire or a tick box in their websites/platforms for customers to confirm that they are engaged in business in the Philippines. The NRDSP may also request other business registration documents, such as the BIR COR, if the NRDSP's system is capable of obtaining/receiving this document. This helps ensure that the correct VAT treatment is applied, reducing the risk of non-compliance.\n\nQ28: How can VAT-registered Philippine business customers substantiate their input taxes for digital services purchased from NRDSPs?\n\nA28: VAT-registered Philippine business customers/buyers shall use the filed withholding VAT return/BIR Form No. 1600-VT as proof to support their claim for input VAT on purchases of digital services from NRDSPs in accordance with Section 7 (C) of RR No. 3-2025. AIDSTE\n\nQ29: The reckoning point of the VAT liability of the NRDSPs will start on June 2, 2025. There are existing contracts covering January 1 to December 31, 2025. The Philippine buyer already paid in advance the total price for the full year contract, that is, from January to December, 2025, without the 12% VAT. Would the NRDSP still be liable for the payment of VAT for the period June 2 to December 31, 2025?\n\nA29: The VAT liability for NRDSPs begins on June 2, 2025. This means that any digital services provided from June 2, 2025 onwards are subject to the 12% VAT. If the Philippine buyer already paid for the full-year contract in advance without including the 12% VAT, the NRDSP is still liable for the VAT on the portion of services provided from June 2 onwards. The liability to pay and remit the VAT in this scenario shall lie with the NRDSP since the buyer no longer has control over the payment.\n\nQ30: In cases where the contracting party of the NRDSP is outside the Philippines (e.g., in the US) and the US entity shares costs with different markets (including subsidiaries in the Philippines), is the shared cost charged against the Philippine subsidiary subject to VAT under RR No. 3-2025?\n\nA30: RA No. 12023 imposes a 12% VAT on digital services consumed in the Philippines, whether provided by resident or non-resident digital service providers. The law clarifies that VAT is applicable to digital services, regardless of the provider's physical presence, as long as it is consumed in the Philippines. Therefore, if the shared cost is for digital services consumed by the Philippine subsidiary, it would be subject to VAT. In this case, the Philippine subsidiary shall be responsible in withholding and remitting the VAT due thereon to the BIR as a B2B transaction.\n\nAll revenue officers and employees are hereby enjoined to be guided accordingly and give this Circular as wide a publicity as possible.\n\nThis Circular takes effect immediately.\n\n(SGD.)

                                    "Details": "The Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) is a unique identifier issued by the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) for all taxpayers in the Philippines, serving as a crucial component in the administration of tax laws and regulations. In line with the government's efforts to improve tax administration, ensure compliance, promote transparency and accountability in its transactions, the BIR has recognized the need to standardize the compliance on the submission of TIN for members of cooperatives. aDSIHc\n\nThe BIR, however, is cognizant that cooperatives have been facing challenges and difficulties in securing and submitting their members' TIN due to various factors, such as capacity of the members to understand the BIR regulations pertaining to application of TIN, delays in securing documentary requirements for registration or other administration issues. As such, taken into account these factors, and in order to aid in the smooth implementation of the requirement of TIN in the application of Certificate of Tax Exemption (CTE) of the cooperatives and to allow ample time to comply with the requirement, this Circular is being issued.\n\nI. Timeline in the compliance of cooperatives in the submission of TIN\n\nAll cooperatives must ensure that their members possess valid TIN in compliance with Section 236 of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended (Tax Code) and Revenue Regulations No. 7-2012. As a general rule, the cooperative must submit a list of all its members with their corresponding TINs to the BIR, along with other documentary requirements pursuant to Revenue Memorandum Order No. 76-2010.\n\nHowever, in case the cooperatives fail to secure the TIN of all its members due to justifiable reasons, the cooperatives are given a period of nine (9) months to comply with the TIN requirement, but in no case shall it delay the processing and issuance by the concerned office of the BIR of the CTE of the cooperative.\n\nII. Justifiable Reasons\n\nThe cooperative which fails to secure the TIN of all its members are required to submit a Sworn Affidavit stating therein all the justifiable reasons for failure to comply with the TIN requirement for its members prior to the application of CTE, and with an undertaking that the cooperative will comply with the TIN requirement within 9 months from the issuance of CTE subject to administrative penalties as prescribed under Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 158-2022. ATICcS\n\nThe justifiable reasons advanced shall be taken into account in formulating policies, rules and procedures to further improve taxpayers' service and enhance the system of issuing TIN especially to individual taxpayers.\n\nIII. Application of the CTE where the only lacking requirement is TIN of the members\n\nThe application for CTE of the cooperative, where the only lacking requirement is the TIN of its members, will still be processed and the corresponding CTE issued by the concerned office of the BIR, provided that a Sworn Affidavit as required in Item II is submitted.\n\nIV. Denial and Suspension/Revocation of CTE\n\nNo CTE of the cooperatives shall be suspended/revoked and no application for CTE shall be denied solely on the basis of the non-submission of the TIN of its members until the availability of the enhanced Online Registration and Update System (ORUS) of the BIR is in place, provided that the Sworn Affidavit as required in Item II is submitted. A separate revenue issuance shall be promulgated as soon as the enhanced ORUS is available and already in place.\n\nAll revenue issuances and BIR Rulings inconsistent herewith are hereby amended, modified or revoked accordingly.\n\nAll internal revenue officials, employees and others concerned are hereby enjoined to give this Circular as wide publicity as possible.\n\n(SGD.)

VAT refund claims shall be subject to validation by the processing office as to the completeness of the documentary requirements submitted during the filing of application, hence, claims for VAT refund shall be physically or manually filed at the designated processing office authorized to receive applications.\n\n4. The taxpayer-claimant shall ensure the completeness and authenticity of the documentary requirements submitted upon filing of the application for VAT refund. Hence, only applications with complete documentary requirements, as enumerated in the Checklist of Requirements (Annexes \"A.1.1\", \"A.1.2\", or \"A.2\", whichever is applicable), shall be received and processed by the authorized processing office.\n\n5. In case where the taxpayer-claimant filed the VAT refund claim beyond the 2-year prescriptive period as required under Section 112 of the Tax Code, the claim shall be accepted, however, the processing office shall recommend outright denial thereof.\n\n6. If upon filing or during the processing of the VAT refund claim, the taxpayer-claimant has outstanding tax liabilities (final and executory) as defined under Section II (1) of Revenue Memorandum Order No. 11-2014, and evidenced by Delinquency Verification Certificate prescribed in Annex \"A\" of Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 64-2019, the ensuing approved VAT refund shall be referred for garnishment to the following:\n\na. For Taxpayer-Claimants under the Large Taxpayers Service. \u2014 Large Taxpayers Collection Enforcement Division.\n\nb. For Taxpayer-Claimants under the Revenue District Offices. \u2014 Collection Section of the Revenue District Office and Collection Division of the Revenue Region having jurisdiction over the taxpayer-claimant.\n\nc. For Taxpayer-Claimants with Delinquent Accounts Originating from the National Investigation Division and Special Task Force. \u2014 Collection Enforcement Monitoring Section of the Accounts Receivable Monitoring Division.\n\nThe said approved VAT refund may be used to settle or collect either fully or partially the outstanding delinquent tax liability subject to existing tax laws and revenue issuances on the enforcement and settlement of delinquent accounts. DETACa\n\n7. The documents listed hereunder shall be signed by the following:\n\na. Application for VAT refund, affidavit's and/or such other document/s supporting the claim, other than the copies of sales invoices or receipts in support of sales and purchases, shall be signed by the duly-authorized signatory of the taxpayer-claimant.\n\nThe \"Secretary's Certificate,\" \"Partnership Resolution,\" or \"Special Power of Attorney\" designating/authorizing said representative of the corporate claimant, partnership or sole proprietorship, as the case may be, should be notarized and must be presented to the processing office, together with one (1) valid government-issued Identification Card (ID) of the said authorized representative.\n\nb. Certified copies of invoices/receipts in support of sales and purchases shall be signed by the president or proprietor or head of the finance or accounting of the taxpayer-claimant. The said authorized official may assign other signatory/ies who are knowledgeable in the accounting and/or custodianship of the said documents.\n\nThe \"Secretary's Certificate,\" \"Partnership Resolution,\" or \"Special Power of Attorney\" designating/authorizing said signatory of the corporate claimant, partnership or sole proprietorship, as the case may be, should be notarized and must be presented to the processing office, together with the company ID of the said official or employee of the taxpayer-claimant.\n\n8. For VAT refund claims where the period covered starts from April 1, 2025, the following rules shall apply:\n\na. No refund of input VAT shall be allowed on the part of the export-oriented enterprise (EOE) that attained the seventy percent (70%) threshold from the preceding taxable year in case the local suppliers passed-on VAT on the local purchases of goods directly attributable to the former's export activity for the immediately succeeding year despite securing VAT zero-rating certificate from the Export Marketing Bureau (EMB) of the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI). In such cases, the qualified exporter may contest the same and/or resolve with the local supplier for the reimbursement of the VAT paid, if any, or convert the transaction from twelve percent (12%) VAT to VAT at zero percent (0%).\n\nb. Upon the effectivity of R.A. No. 12066 and its implementing rules and regulations, the EMB shall accept applications of EOEs for VAT zero-rating on their local purchases and VAT exemption on their importations. To avoid duplication of government agencies having to validate the export activities of taxpayer-claimants, the EMB shall certify the direct export sales of qualified taxpayer-claimants. Hence, documents evidencing actual export of goods or services shall be submitted to the EMB for their scrutiny and issuance of a certification as to its veracity through a template/schedule prescribed for this purpose. The processing office of the BIR shall verify the export sales of the taxpayer-claimant on the basis of the certification issued by the EMB. HEITAD\n\nc. EOEs that have attained the 70% export threshold from the preceding taxable year but failed to secure certification from the EMB shall not be allowed for VAT refund covering the immediately succeeding year. However, the unutilized input VAT may be carried forward to the subsequent taxable quarters and can be utilized against future VAT liabilities.\n\nd. For EOEs that failed to meet the threshold from the preceding year and would claim for refund the input taxes from their local purchases attributable to zero-rated sales on the immediately succeeding year, the copy of the notification from the EMB with a clear statement that sales from the preceding year is below the 70% threshold must be submitted. This proves that the immediately succeeding year (that is the taxable year covered by the VAT refund claim) is not qualified for VAT zero-rating on local purchases and is therefore subject to 12% VAT. Also, a certified copy of the schedule or evaluation sheet from the EMB, containing the result of validation of export sales and inward remittances for the current year or taxable year covered by the VAT refund claim shall be submitted in lieu of the export documents such as airwaybills/bills of lading to prove actual export and bank certifications to prove inward remittances.\n\ne. For taxpayer-claimants that have purchases from registered business enterprises (RBEs) covered under RR No. 9-2025, no input VAT shall be claimed until the corresponding VAT has been paid on the purchase from RBE-sellers. The following documents are required for the local buyers of RBEs:\n\n1. Sales Invoice issued by the RBE showing the amount of VAT on local sales; and,\n\n2. Copy of the corresponding duly-filed BIR Form No. I600VT or BIR Form No. 0605, whichever is applicable. aDSIHc\n\nIII. DOCUMENTS TO BE SUBMITTED BY THE TAXPAYER-CLAIMANT UPON FILING OF THE APPLICATION FOR VAT REFUND\n\n1. The application/s must be accompanied with complete supporting documents enumerated in the Checklist of Requirements under Annexes \"A.1.1\", \"A.1.2\", or \"A.2\", whichever is applicable, to wit:\n\na. For claims of input VAT attributable to zero-rated sales under Section 112 (A) of the Tax Code. \u2014 VAT refund claims filed starting April 1, 2025 onwards may include claims covering taxable periods prior to the effectivity of R.A. No. 12066 and its implementing rules and regulations, which still does not require EMB to certify direct exports of export-oriented enterprises. Thus, export-oriented enterprises that were passed on VAT on their local purchases and importation upon the effectivity of R.A. No. 12066 on November 28, 2024, may claim for VAT refund until the effectivity of the Department Administrative Order that will be issued by the DTI-EMB to effect the processing of VAT zero-rating on local purchases and VAT-exemption on importation of export-oriented enterprises. Hence, documentary requirements significantly vary for claims covering taxable period/s prior to and after April 1, 2025. In this regard, and to provide clarity in the documentary requirements, the appropriate checklists of requirements are hereto prescribed:\n\nTaxable Period Covered\n\nAnnex No.\n\nPrior to April 1, 2025\n\nA.1.1\n\nApril 1, 2025 Onwards\n\nA.1.2\n\nb. For claims of accumulated input VAT as of the date of cessation/closure of business or change of registration status from VAT to non-VAT. \u2014 Annex \"A.2\"\n\n2. As could be gleaned from the said list of mandatory requirements, most documents or data that can be culled from the records of the BIR are no longer required to be submitted in compliance with the Ease of Doing Business Law (R.A. No. 11032). However, taxpayer-claimants are not precluded from submitting copies of the same to aid the processing offices in the timely processing of the VAT refund claim, subject to verification of the said documents from the records of the BIR.\n\n3. The duly-certified copies of invoices/receipts for sales and purchases submitted for verification by the assigned Revenue Officers (ROs) shall be forwarded to the Commission on Audit (COA) if the claim is approved for refund. The original copies of the invoices or receipts in support of the input taxes claimed from local purchases shall be stamped with \"VAT refund claimed\" by the assigned ROs which may be conducted at the processing office for those with minimal volume of documents or at the taxpayer-claimant's registered office address for voluminous documents. ATICcS\n\n4. Claims for refund of unutilized input VAT on importation shall be supported with a \"VAT Payment Certification\" issued by the Revenue Accounting Division (RAD) of the Bureau of Customs (BOC) National Office. Only the importations appearing on the certification of BOC-RAD shall be considered in the computation of refundable amount.\n\n5. For the amortized portion of the input VAT on aggregate purchases of capital goods exceeding one million pesos (P1,000,000.00) in a month pursuant to Section 110 (A) (2) (b) of the Tax Code, the following rules shall apply:\n\na. For current claims, the corresponding sales invoices and/or official receipts, including proofs of payment, if qualified as \"big ticket\" purchase, shall be required to be submitted and verified.\n\nb. For the amortized deferred input VAT which originated from purchases prior to the period of claim, acceptability of supporting documents is clarified as follows:\n\nb.1 If the source documents of the capital goods were submitted and verified during the time they were claimed, there is no need to re-submit the same source documents. Instead, the schedule of amortization of deferred input VAT in the approved report will be the basis in determining the amortized portion in the subsequent claims.\n\nb.2 For claims coming from the amortized portion of the deferred input VAT on importation of capital goods, photocopies of previous certifications from BOC-RAD, in addition to the certified schedules mentioned under b.1 above.\n\nb.3 In case the input VAT of capital goods was previously disallowed due to noncompliance with the invoicing requirements for local purchases and importation or for some other reasons which may warrant absolute disallowance of the corresponding input VAT, the taxpayer-claimant is already barred from claiming the input VAT from the said purchases for the current claim and thereafter.\n\nb.4 For purchase/importation of capital goods made starting January 1, 2022, no amortization shall be made and the input VAT shall be claimed on the month of purchase in accordance with Section 110 (B) of Tax Code. ETHIDa\n\nb.5 The unexpired portion of deferred input VAT on capital goods may be claimed for VAT refund under Section 112 of the Tax Code until fully amortized even after the effectivity of R.A. No. 12066 and its implementing rules and regulations.\n\n6. Only the tax returns filed by the taxpayer-claimant, particularly the quarterly and/or Annual Income Tax Returns, the Quarterly VAT Returns (QVR) and the QVR showing the deduction of the amount of input VAT sought to be refunded, on or before the date of application of the VAT refund or the issuance of a Letter of Authority, whichever comes first, shall be considered in the processing of the claim.\n\nThe QVR showing the deduction of the amount of input VAT sought to be refunded that are filed after the date of application of the VAT refund or the issuance of a Letter of Authority covering the taxable period of the filed QVR shall result in the denial of the claim for non-compliance of Section 110 (C) of the Tax Code, which requires that the sum of the excess input tax carried over from the preceding quarter and the input tax creditable to a VAT-registered person during the taxable quarter shall be reduced by the amount of claim for VAT refund.\n\n7. The taxpayer-claimant shall attach a notarized sworn certification (Annexes \"A.1.3.1\" and \"A.1.3.2\") attesting to the completeness of the documents submitted. Accordingly, the claim/s shall be processed based on the documents submitted. The books of accounts and accounting records shall be presented by the taxpayer-claimant upon written request of the assigned ROs. Failure to present the books of accounts and accounting records relevant to the claim/s may be a ground for denial of the claim.\n\n8. For claims filed under Section 112 (B) of the Tax Code, despite the closure or cessation of business, the taxpayer-claimant must ensure cooperation with the assigned ROs. Failure to cooperate with the assigned ROs may result in the full or partial denial of the claim.\n\nIV. REPEALING CLAUSE\n\nAll revenue issuances and BIR Rulings inconsistent herewith are hereby considered amended, modified or revoked accordingly.\n\nV. EFFECTIVITY\n\nThis Circular shall take effect immediately.\n\nAll internal revenue officials and employees concerned are hereby enjoined to give this Circular as wide a publicity as possible.

HTcADC\n\nSection III of RMO No. 2-2025 provides the coverage of requiring and issuing a TCFG as follows:\n\n\"III. COVERAGE\n\n1. Government contracts for any procurement done through public bidding process pursuant to RA No. 9184 otherwise known as the \"Government Procurement Reform Act,\" as amended by RA No. 12009 shall be covered by the TCFG;\n\n2. Government contracts for the procurement of goods, consulting services, and infrastructure projects pursuant to the scope and application as defined under RA No. 9184; and\"\n\nIn relation thereto, this Office clarifies that the TCFG shall be required and issued only for government contracts which involves the procurement of goods, consulting services, and infrastructure projects done through public bidding process pursuant to RA No. 9184 otherwise known as the \"Government Procurement Reform Act,\" as amended by RA No. 12009. Procurement involving small value purchases are not required to secure TCFG.\n\nPursuant to Section IV of RMO No. 2-2025, TCFG shall be defined as follows:\n\n\"IV. DEFINITION OF TERMS\n\nFor the purpose of this Order, the following words and/or phrases shall be defined as follows:\n\n1. \"Tax Clearance Certificate for Final Settlement of Government Contracts (TCFG)\" \u2014 refers to the certificate to be secured by the contactor who have existing contracts with the government, its departments, bureaus, offices and agencies, including state universities and colleges, government-owned and/or controlled corporations, government financial institutions and local government units which will be presented prior to the final settlement of the government contracts to ensure complete and timely payment and remittance of taxes.\n\nThis Office clarifies that the TCFG shall be presented only prior to the final settlement of the government contracts with its suppliers on a per contract basis to ensure complete and timely payment and remittance of taxes.

                                    "Details": "This Circular is issued to provide clarifications and realign inconsistencies on certain provisions of Revenue Memorandum Circular (RMC) No. 75-2024 relative to the mandatory requirements for Tax Credit Certificates or cash refund of excess/unutilized CWT on income under Section 76 (C), in relation to Sections 204 (C) and 229 of the Tax Code. HSAcaE\n\nI. Clarification to certain provisions and requirements\n\nQ1: In the list of mandatory requirements under Annexes \"A.1\" for those taxpayers of going-concern status and \"A.2\" for taxpayers undergoing cessation or dissolution of business of RMC No. 75-2024, Annex \"A.1\" required original copies of duly accomplished Certificate of Creditable Tax Withheld at Source (BIR Form No. 2307) whereas Annex \"A.2\" is silent whether the said documents should be original or copies only. Will this result in the disallowance of the CWT if the taxpayer submitted scanned, facsimile, photocopy or a notarized or certified copy of the original or electronic document is considered duplicate only?\n\nA1: No. In this digital era, transmission of documents such as the BIR Form No. 2307 is not limited only to the physical delivery of documents from the sender to the receiver, which could also be through digital means such as but not limited to electronic mails, facsimile, cellphones, or other emerging technologies. Hence, the copies produced and submitted by the recipient of BIR Form No. 2307 may not necessarily be the original copy.\n\nIncluded in the verification procedures of the processing office is the validation of the authenticity and veracity of the claimed BIR Form No. 2307 by comparing the CWT claimed per Summary Alphalist of Withholding Agents of Income Payments Subjected to Withholding Tax at Source (SAWT) submitted by the taxpayer claimant with the annual or quarterly Alphalist of payees as attached in the BIR Form No. 1604E or 1601E submitted by the withholding agents of the taxpayer-claimant. If the data matches, the BIR can already be assured that the BIR Form 2307 claimed by the taxpayer-claimant is valid and authentic which makes the question as to whether or not the submitted document is an original copy already moot and academic.\n\nIn this regard and for consistency of application, the third item in Annex A.1 shall now read as: \"Copies of duly accomplished Certificate of Creditable Tax Withheld at Source (BIR Form No. 2307) or Withholding Tax Remittance Return for Onerous Transfer of Real Property Other Than Capital Asset (BIR Form No. 1606), whichever is applicable, issued by the payor (withholding agent) to the payee.\" AScHCD\n\nQ2: If the taxpayer claimant is engaged in real estate business, should the Withholding Tax Remittance Return for Onerous Transfer of Real Property Other Than Capital Asset (BIR Form No. 1606) be original as required in Annex \"A.1\"?\n\nA2: No. The processing office is mandated to verify from the BIR database if the said return was indeed filed by the taxpayer claimant to establish the authenticity and veracity of the said document. A reproduction of the original copy of the said form would suffice.\n\nQ3: Section 76 (C) of the Tax Code pertains to corporate claimants only. In case an individual taxpayer incurred unutilized CWT and intends to refund or credit the said excess income taxes, what will be the basis of the claim?\n\nA3: It is confirmed that Section 76 of the Tax Code covers tax credit or refund claims of CORPORATIONS as defined under Section 22 (B) of the Tax Code. For individual taxpayers, the claim may be anchored under Section 58 (E), in relation to Section 204 of the Tax Code, to quote:\n\n\"Sec. 58. Returns and Payment of Taxes withheld at Source. \u2014\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\nE. Income of Recipient. \u2014 Income upon which any creditable tax is required to be withheld at source under Section 57 shall be included in the return of its recipient but the excess of the amount of tax so withheld over the tax due on his return shall be refunded to him subject to the provisions of Section 204. x x x\"\n\nQ4: RMC No. 75-2024, in relation to Revenue Memorandum Order (RMO) No. 25-2024, pertain to claims of income tax credit or refund filed under Section 76 (C) of the Tax Code, which, consequently is for corporate taxpayers. Will a new set of documentary requirements be required for individual taxpayer-claimants?\n\nA4: Yes. A new set of mandatory requirements will be prescribed for individual taxpayers who intend to claim for tax credit or refund unutilized CWT pursuant to Section 58 (E), in relation to Section 204 of the Tax Code. However, the general policies and guidelines in the mandatory documentary requirements in RMC No. 75-2024 and the procedures in the processing hereof pursuant to RMO No. 25-2024 remain the same for both corporate and individual taxpayer-claimants. HESIcT\n\nQ5: What is the implication to the claim of tax returns filed after filing of the income tax credit/refund claim or the issuance of the Electronic Letter of Authority (eLA), whichever comes first?\n\nA5: Once the claim for income tax credit has been filed or an eLA has been issued covering the same period of the claim, the taxpayer-claimant is already precluded from amending the tax returns. In the existing procedures for processing of income tax credit/refund certain BIR Forms are no longer required to be submitted by the taxpayer-claimants but the processing offices are mandated to verify and produce copies of the said tax returns filed by the taxpayer to be attached to the corresponding tax docket of the claim. Once the application for income tax credit or refund has been officially received by the processing office of the BIR and the verification process commences, only the tax returns filed on or before the receipt of the application shall be considered in the evaluation of the claim. Should there be discrepancies, this may result in the disallowance of the portion of the claim or full denial thereto.\n\nII. Changes in Documentary Requirements\n\nTo effect the changes above, Annex \"A.1\" is hereby renumbered as Annex \"A.1.1\" and Annex \"A.1.2\" is added as the mandatory requirements for individual taxpayer-claimant. Copies of the said Annexes are hereto attached for reference. This correspondingly amends Annexes \"A.1\", \"A.2\" and \"A.4\" of RMC No. 75-2024.\n\nIII. Repealing Clause\n\nAll revenue issuances and BIR Rulings inconsistent herewith are hereby amended, modified or revoked accordingly.\n\nIV. Effectivity\n\nThis Circular shall take effect immediately.\n\n(SGD.) ROMEO D. LUMAGUI, JR.\nCommissioner of Internal Revenue",

The initial direct cost paid or incurred by the lessee in relation to the lease agreement shall be claimed as outright expenses in the year it was paid or incurred subject to substantiation and withholding requirements pursuant to Section 34 of the Tax Code, as amended.\n\nQ6: What shall be the income tax treatment of initial direct costs paid by the lessee in relation to the lease of an asset?\n\nA6: For purposes of taxation, Initial Direct Costs shall be defined as payments which are directly related to the negotiation and execution of a lease agreement. The initial direct cost paid or incurred by the lessee in relation to the lease agreement shall be claimed as outright expenses in the year it was paid or incurred subject to substantiation requirements pursuant to Section 34 (A) (1) (b) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended.\n\nFurthermore, the same shall be subject to withholding tax pursuant to Section 9 of the Ease of Paying Taxes (EOPT) and Section 7 of RR No. 4-2024, as provided below:\n\n\"SECTION 7. Withholding of Tax at Source. Section 2.57.4 of RR No. 2-98, as amended, shall now read as follows:\n\n'Sec. 2.57.4. Time of Withholding. The obligation of the payor to deduct and withhold the tax under Section 2.57 of these Regulations arises at the time an income has become payable. The term \"payable\" refers to the date the obligation becomes due, demandable or legally enforceable. The obligation of the payor to deduct and withhold the tax arises at the time an income payment is accrued or recorded as an expense or asset, whichever is applicable, in the payor's books, or at the issuance by the seller of the sales invoice or other adequate document to support such payable, whichever comes first.'\n\nIt was however clarified under RMC No. 60-2024 that the non-withholding of tax will no longer be a ground for the disallowance of the claimed deduction/expense for taxable year covering January 1, 2024 onwards.\n\nQ7: What shall be the income tax treatment of expenses paid or incurred by the lessee which are properly for the account of the lessor?\n\nA7: The amounts paid by the lessee for certain expenses, which are properly for the account of the lessor as indicated in the contractual agreement between the parties, shall be allowed as deductions during the year the same has been paid or accrued pursuant to Section 34 of the Tax Code, as amended. Provided, however, that lessor shall issue invoices/receipts in the name of the lessee (e.g., realty tax, association dues, etc.)\n\nQ7: What shall be the income tax treatment of expenses paid or incurred by the lessee which are properly for the account of the lessor?\n\nA7: The amounts paid by the lessee for certain expenses, which are properly for the account of the lessor as indicated in the contractual agreement between the parties, shall be allowed as deductions during the year the same has been paid or accrued pursuant to Section 34 of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, which shall be properly substantiated with invoices issued by the lessor in the name of the lessee. Thus, it will form part as gross sales of lessor and allowable as deduction on the part of the lessee.\n\nQ12: What are the business tax implications relative to leases?\n\nA12: For business tax purposes, the following guidelines shall still be observed:\n\n1. The corresponding input VAT shall only be creditable to the lessee upon payment of the rentals, which shall be evidenced by a VAT Official Receipt pursuant to Section 110 in relation to Section 113 of the Tax Code, as amended.\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\nQ12: What are the business tax implications relative to leases?\n\nA12: For business tax purposes, the following guidelines shall still be observed:\n\n1.

Hence, only the actual rental paid or accrued shall be considered as the tax base for EWT purposes, without regard to the depreciation expense from the ROUA.\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\nQ13: What are the withholding tax implications of leases?\n\nA13: The 5% withholding tax under Section 2.57.2 (B) of RR No. 02-98 shall be based on the amount payable which refers to the value paid/accrued or recorded as an expense or asset, whichever is applicable in the payor's book or at the issuance by the seller of the sales invoice or other adequate document to support such payable whichever comes first pursuant to Section 7 of RR No. 4-2024.\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\nRMC No. 12-2024 (FOREX Transactions)\n\nQ17: What will be the basis for the reportable amount of transactions denominated in foreign currency for taxes other than income tax (e.g., Value-Added Tax (VAT), Gross Receipt Tax (GRT), Other Percentage Tax (OPT), Excise Tax, Documentary Stamp Tax (DST), etc.)?\n\nA17: Foreign Currency transactions are converted into Philippine Peso using the prevailing spot rate on the date of transaction. This is the basis of the reportable transactions of taxes other than income tax (e.g., VAT, GRT, OPT, Excise, DST, etc.)\n\nQ17: What will be the basis for the reportable amount of transactions in foreign currency for taxes other than income tax (e.g., Value-Added Tax (VAT), Other Percentage Tax (OPT), Excise Tax, Documentary Stamp Tax (DST), etc.)?\n\nA17: For taxes other than income tax (e.g., VAT, OPT, Excise, DST, etc.), the basis of the reportable amount for foreign currency transactions shall be the Philippine Peso-converted amount using the prevailing spot rate on the date of transaction.\n\nIn determining the date of transaction, the enactment of RA 11976 or EOPT Act shall be taken into consideration which provides the revised bases for the reportable amounts for VAT, OPT and withholding taxes, as follows:\n\nFor VAT purposes, the reportable amount for sale of goods or properties shall be the gross selling price or the gross value in money as supported by a corresponding sales invoice; while for sale or exchange of services, including the use or lease of property, it shall be the gross receipts as supported by a corresponding official receipt.\n\nFor VAT purposes, the reportable amount for sale of goods, properties and sale or exchange of services shall be the gross sales as supported by a corresponding VAT invoice; [1]\n\nFor GRT and OPT, the reportable amount shall be the gross quarterly sales or receipts depending on the type of transaction subject to the said taxes.\n\nFor OPT, the reportable amount shall be the gross quarterly sales depending on the type of transaction subject to the said taxes; [2]\n\nFor Excise, the reportable amount shall be the excise taxes imposed and based on weight or volume capacity or any other physical unit of measurement (specific tax) and imposed and based on selling price or other specified value of the goods (ad valorem tax) generally before the removal/release of the excisable products.\n\nFor Excise, the reportable amount shall be: a) Specific tax. The excise taxes imposed based on weight or volume capacity or any other physical unit of measurement. b) Ad valorem tax. The excise tax shall be based on selling price or other specified value of goods before the removal/release of the excisable products;\n\nFor DST, the reportable amount shall be based on the value of the documents subject to stamp tax.\n\nFor DST, the reportable amount shall be based on the value provided in the documents subject to stamp tax; and\n\nFor withholding taxes, in general, the reportable amount shall be the value of the taxable income payment at the time it is paid or payable or when it is accrued or recorded as an expense or asset, whichever comes first.\n\nFor withholding taxes, in general, the reportable amount shall be the value of the taxable income payment at the time it has become payable, accrued or recorded as an expense or asset, whichever is applicable, in the payor's books, or at the issuance by the seller of the sales invoice or other adequate document to support such payable, whichever comes first.\n\nRMC No. 19-2024 (Interest Expense)\n\nQ1: When can interest expense be claimed as a deduction from gross income?\n\nA1: Interest paid or incurred within a taxable year on indebtedness in connection with the taxpayer's profession, trade or business shall be allowed as a deduction from gross income, subject to certain limitations, when the following requisites, provided in Section 34 (B) (2) of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) of 1997, as amended, and as implemented by Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 13-2000 and Section 7 (B) of RR No. 5-2021, are met:\n\n1. The indebtedness must be that of the taxpayer;\n\n2. The interest must have been stipulated in writing;\n\n3. The interest must be legally due;\n\n4. The interest payment arrangement must not be between related taxpayers as mandated in Sec. 34 (B) (2) (b), in relation to Sec. 36 (B), both of the NIRC of 1997, as amended;\n\n5. The interest must not be incurred to finance petroleum operations;\n\n6. The interest was not treated as \"capital expenditure\" if such interest was incurred in acquiring property used in trade, business or exercise of profession; and\n\n7. The interest shall be reduced by an amount equivalent to twenty percent (20%) of interest income subjected to final tax. However, if the final withholding tax rate on interest income of twenty percent (20%) will be adjusted in the future, the interest reduction shall be adjusted accordingly.\n\nIn addition, the taxpayer must have withheld the appropriate tax in order to claim the interest expense as a deduction from the gross income (refer to Q9).\n\nQ1: When can interest expense be claimed as a deduction from gross income?\n\nA1: Interest paid or incurred within a taxable year on indebtedness in connection with the taxpayer's profession, trade or business shall be allowed as a deduction from gross income, subject to certain limitations, when the following requisites, provided in Section 34 (B) (2) of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) of 1997, as amended, and as implemented by RR No. 13-2000 and Section 7 (B) of RR No. 5-2021, are met:\n\n1. The indebtedness must be that of the taxpayer;\n\n2. The interest must have been stipulated in writing;\n\n3. The interest must be legally due;\n\n4. The interest payment arrangement must not be between related taxpayers as mandated in Sec. 34 (B) (2) (b), in relation to Sec. 36 (B), both of the NIRC of 1997, as amended;\n\n5. The interest must not be incurred to finance petroleum operations;\n\n6. The interest was not treated as \"capital expenditure\" if such interest was incurred in acquiring property used in trade, business or exercise of profession; and\n\n7. The interest shall be reduced by an amount equivalent to twenty percent (20%) of interest income subjected to final tax. However, if the final withholding tax rate on interest income of twenty percent (20%) will be adjusted in the future, the interest reduction shall be adjusted accordingly.\n\nThe requirement to withhold taxes in order to claim the interest expense as a deduction from the gross income was repealed under Section 5 of the EOPT Act, as implemented by Section 6 of RR No. 4-2024.\n\nAs clarified in RMC No. 60-2024, [3] the non-withholding of tax will no longer be a ground for the disallowance of the claimed interest expense for taxable year covering January 1, 2024 onwards. However, the obligation of the payor to withhold tax and remit the same under Q9 remains, pursuant to Section 9 of the EOPT Act and as implemented by Section 7 of RR No. 4-2024, to wit:\n\n\"SECTION 7. Withholding of Tax at Source. Section 2.57.4 of RR No. 2-98, as amended, shall now read as follows:\n\n'Sec. 2.57.4. Time of Withholding. The obligation of the payor to deduct and withhold the tax under Section 2.57 of these Regulations arises at the time an income has become payable. The term \"payable\" refers to the date the obligation becomes due, demandable or legally enforceable. The obligation of the payor to deduct and withhold the tax arises at the time an income payment is accrued or recorded as an expense or asset, whichever is applicable, in the payor's books, or at the issuance by the seller of the sales invoice or other adequate document to support such payable, whichever comes first.'\n\nCLARIFICATIONS/TRANSITORY PROVISIONS:\n\nI. RMC NO. 12-2024 (FOREX TRANSACTIONS)\n\nQ1: Is the use of average rate for a period under Philippine Accounting Standards (PAS) 21 for Foreign Currency Transactions permitted both for Financial Reporting and Tax purposes? CAIHTE\n\nA1: No. For tax purposes, foreign currency transactions shall be converted to Philippine Peso using only the spot rate of exchange on the date of transaction.\n\nConversely, for financial reporting purposes, Paragraph 22 of PAS 21 allows a rate that approximates the actual rate at the date of the transaction (e.g., an average rate for a week or a month might be used for all transactions in each foreign currency occurring that period) can be used for practical reasons provided that specific spot rate within the day (opening, closing, high, low or weighted average in a day) has been identified in the sworn statement. However, if exchange rates fluctuate significantly, the use of the average rate for a certain period is inappropriate.\n\nIn the event that in converting foreign currency transactions, the taxpayer used the average rate for a certain period for financial reporting purposes and the spot rate of exchange on the date of transaction for tax purposes, a reconciliation on the foreign exchange (forex) rates used must be prepared and must be available for presentation and submission, together with other supporting documents, during Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) audit.\n\nQ2: PAS 21 does not mandate the use of forex rates published exclusively by a specified source for financial reporting purposes. Do taxpayers have an option to choose the source of forex rate to be used in converting foreign currency denominated transactions for tax purposes?\n\nA2: Yes. Q&A No. 4 of RMC No. 12-2024 standardizes the forex rates to be used for tax purposes in converting foreign currency denominated transactions to Philippine Peso. It prescribes the use of forex rates from sources that are widely available to the taxpayers and that can be easily accessed by BIR during tax audits. Taxpayers are given freedom to choose the source of forex rates to be used that are deemed appropriate for their foreign currency transactions as long as the conditions under Q&A No. 4 of RMC No. 12-2024 are met. aScITE\n\nQ3: What shall be the spot rate applicable for transactions that occurred prior to the opening of Banker's Association of the Philippines (BAP) Rates at 9 AM like transactions between 6 AM to 8 AM or before 9 AM?\n\nA3: For transactions occurring prior to the opening of the BAP Rates, the taxpayer shall use the latest selected spot rate available on the business date immediately preceding the opening of the BAP rates. The use of selected spot rate shall cover the duration up to the cut-off period to avoid multiple use of forex spot rate resulting to various reconciliation. Thus, the duration of the opening/closing spot rate will be up to the next business day. However, if the taxpayer opts to use other or combination of spot rate within the day, such shall be included in the Sworn Statement for submission to BIR concerned office as a guide for proper calculation during audit.\n\nMoreover, the taxpayer shall summarize its foreign currency transactions occurring prior to the opening of the BAP rates, adopting the latest selected spot rate available on the business date immediately preceding the opening of the BAP rates. The summary schedules which is necessary to reconcile the date prior to opening of BAP rate shall be made available for presentation and submission during the BIR audit.\n\nQ4: Is netting or offsetting of forex gains and losses allowed for income tax purposes?\n\nA4: No. The practice of offsetting or netting of separate and distinct transactions, and the accounting and recording of the same and its related/incidental transactions (e.g., forex gains/losses) in the taxpayer's books, is strictly prohibited for tax purposes.\n\nEach transaction is considered a separate taxable event, hence, shall be accounted and taxed separately from other transactions. Regardless if there is an offsetting or netting arrangement between parties, the income and expenses shall be recorded and taxed separately from each other. Moreover, since losses are among those deductions from Gross Income provided under Section 34 of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997 (Tax Code), as amended, such losses (e.g., forex loss) shall not form part of deduction from Gross Sales.\n\nQ5: What is the deadline for submission of the Notarized Sworn Statement as a Requirement under Q&A No. 4 of RMC 12-2024?\n\nA5: The notarized sworn statement informing the concerned BIR offices of electing the use of forex rates other than BAP published rates shall be submitted within 30 days prior to the start of the taxable year. In case of subsequent change in forex rates used, a new notice shall be submitted to the concerned BIR office, which shall be applied from the start of the succeeding taxable year. DETACa\n\nSince RMC No. 12-2024 was issued on January 22, 2024, which is beyond the required period of 30 days prior to the start of the taxable year, taxpayers shall submit the Notarized Sworn Statement to the concerned BIR offices for the selected forex rates for 2024 without penalty/sanction on or before December 31, 2024. In case elected/used forex rates for 2024 with corresponding Sworn Statement is the same for the succeeding year/s, there is no need to resubmit a Sworn Statement for the year 2025.\n\nThe template for the Notarized Sworn Statement is attached as Annex \"A\".\n\nQ6: What is the timeline for Taxpayers who intends to adopt the standardized forex rates under Q&A No. 4 of RMC 12-2024 on their duly registered Computerized Accounting System (CAS) or Computerized Books of Accounts (CBA)?\n\nA6: Taxpayers that are using duly registered CAS or CBA need to revisit their system in case alignment is needed in terms of their use of forex rates for financial reporting and what is prescribed as source of forex rates under Q&A No. 4 of RMC 12-2024 for tax purposes. In case the adoption of forex rates will have a direct effect on the financial aspect, the system shall be updated/reconfigured following the existing policies and procedures on system enhancement.\n\nIn order to provide ample time for system reconfiguration adjustments shall be allowed to be undertaken on or before December 31, 2024. In case, system reconfiguration has not been accomplished within December 2024, a request for extension shall be submitted for approval by the Regional Director or Assistant Commissioner-Large Taxpayers Service (LTS) for a period of not more than six (6) months from December 31, 2024.\n\nII. RMC NO. 13-2024 (RETIREMENT BENEFITS)\n\nQ1: What is the rationale for the exclusion of entities applying Philippine Financial Reporting Standard (PFRS) for Small-Medium Enterprises (SMEs), considering that PFRS for SME allows use of projected unit credit method for Defined Benefit plans?\n\nA1: The RMCs issued by the BIR to address the gaps between the PFRS and the Tax Code only cover the standards under the full PFRS. The PFRS for SMEs and Small Entities were excluded from the coverage since certain standards adopted in the full PFRS are not applicable to PFRS for SMEs and Small Entities. Hence, to avoid any confusion, the BIR initially limited the coverage of the same to full PFRS. Considering however, the manifestation that there are companies (subsidiary, conglomerates, headquarters, branches, etc.) which are required to comply with rules and standards irrespective of classification, SMEs and/or Small Entities may avail of the provisions of RMC No. 13-2024 on an optional basis and to comply with the required disclosure under PFRS. HEITAD\n\nTo clarify the coverage, the following definition from the Securities and Exchange Commission Memorandum Circular No. 5, series of 2018 has been adopted.\n\n(a) Large and/or Publicly Accountable Entities \u2014\n\nFor purposes of this Rule, large or publicly accountable entities are those that meet any of the following criteria:\n\n(1) Total assets of more than P350 Million or total liabilities of more than P250 Million; or\n\n(2) Are required to file financial statements under Part II of SRC Rule 68; or\n\n(3) Are in the process of filing their financial statements for the purpose of issuing any class instruments in a public market; or\n\n(4) Are holders of secondary licenses issued by regulatory agencies.\n\n* Mandatorily covered by RMC No. 13-2024 as Full PFRS Users\n\n(b) Medium-Sized Entities are those that meet all of the following criteria:\n\n(1) Total assets of more than P100 Million to P350 Million or total liabilities of more than P100 Million to P250 Million. If the entity is a parent company, the said amounts shall be based on the consolidated figures;\n\n(2) Are not required to file financial statements under Part II of SRC Rule 68;\n\n(3) Are not in the process of filing their financial statements for the purpose of issuing any class of instruments in a public market; and\n\n(4) Are not holders of secondary licenses issued by regulatory agencies.\n\n(c) Small Entities are those that meet all of the following criteria:\n\n(1) Total assets of between P3 Million to P100 Million or total liabilities of between P3 Million to P100 Million. If the entity is a parent company, the said amounts shall be based on the consolidated figures; aDSIHc\n\n(2) Are not required to file financial statements under Part II of SRC Rule 68;\n\n(3) Are not in the process of filing their financial statements for the purpose of issuing any class of instruments in public market; and\n\n(4) Are not holders of secondary licenses issued by regulatory agencies.\n\n* The Medium Sized-Entities and Small Entities may avail of the provisions of RMC No. 13-2024 on an optional basis upon compliance with the requirement on disclosure under existing PFRS issuances.\n\n(d) Micro Entities are those that meet all of the following criteria:\n\n(1) Total assets and liabilities are below P3 Million;\n\n(2) Are not required to file financial statements under Part II of SRC Rule 68;\n\n(3) Are not in the process of filling their financial statements for the purpose of issuing any class of instruments in a public market; and\n\n(4) Are not holders of secondary licenses issued by regulatory agencies.\n\nPlease note that the above entity classification for PFRS purposes is not the same with the taxpayer's classification under Section 21 of the Tax Code which is based on annual Gross Sales.\n\nQ2: In the absence of the actuarial valuation report for funding purposes, can the taxpayer use the current service cost under the actuarial valuation report under PAS 19R as replacement of normal cost?\n\nA2: No. In reiteration of Q&A No. 8 of RMC No. 13-2024, there is a difference in the calculation of service/retirement costs under PAS/PFRS and the Tax Code. The current service cost pertains to the amount that the employee earned for his service in the current reporting period while actuarial valuation is an estimate established by an actuary.\n\nQ3: If the taxpayer contributed to the retirement fund before the date of filing of a Tax Qualified Plan but within the taxable period of the interim period between the date of filing and issuance of certificate of qualification, can the taxpayer claim the contribution up to normal cost as a deductible expense?\n\nA3: No. Employers may deduct their contributions to the retirement fund if they meet the requirements under RA No. 4917, evidenced by a certificate of tax qualification issued by the BIR. Nevertheless, pending employers' application with the BIR, contributions to the retirement fund are allowed to be deducted from the gross income subject to the subsequent issuance of the said certificate (Q&A No. 12, RMC No. 13-2024). Any contributions made by an employer to the retirement fund before the filing of application for tax qualified plan are not deductible from gross income for income tax purposes. ATICcS\n\nQ4: Can an employee covered by a retirement benefit plan but determined (at the time of retirement) not qualified under the said retirement benefit plan, be covered by RA No. 7641?\n\nA4: No. Under RA No. 7641, \"in the absence of a retirement plan or agreement providing for retirement benefits of employees in the establishment, an employee upon reaching the age of sixty (60) years or more, but not beyond sixty-five (65) years which is hereby declared the compulsory retirement age, who has served at least five (5) years in the said establishment, may retire and shall be entitled to retirement pay equivalent to at least one-half (1/2) month salary for every year of service, a fraction of at least six (6) months being considered as one whole year.\" It is clear that an employee may only be entitled to the tax-exempt retirement benefits under RA No. 7641 if his/her employer has no existing retirement plan of which the employee is part of. Accordingly, employees covered by a retirement benefit plan (whether determined as reasonable or not by the BIR) may not avail of the tax exemption benefit provided under RA No. 7641.\n\nHowever, in case the concerned employee is not covered by the retirement benefit plan of his/her employer, or any other retirement plan in the employer's company (e.g., Collective Bargaining Agreement), then such employee may receive the tax-exempt retirement benefits provided under RA No. 7641.\n\nQ5: Is an employee who was not included in the retirement benefit plan of the company but qualified under RA No. 7641, authorized to claim exempt benefit?\n\nA5: Yes, said employee is entitled to claim an exempt retirement benefit under RA No. 7641 since he/she was not included in the retirement benefit plan and no contribution was made in his behalf for income tax deduction purposes.\n\nIn addition to the above clarifications, the following are the corrections on the accounting entries provided in Annex B of RMC No. 13-2024:\n\n1. In scenario no. 1, all of the difference between the pension expense of P1,200,000.00 and the deductible pension expense for TY 2023 of P820,000.00 for tax purposes are considered temporary difference because the resulting additional accrual to pension liability of P200,000 will still result in deductible amounts in future periods when the corresponding contribution to the plan is made. Accordingly, corresponding deferred tax assets of P50,000 should also be recognized for such amount (P200,000 x 25%).\n\nMoreover, there is also a temporary difference for the Remeasurement Loss recognized in Other Comprehensive Income of P100,000 because the resulting additional accrual to pension liability also results in deductible amounts in future periods when the corresponding contribution to the plan is made. Accordingly, corresponding deferred tax assets of P25,000 should also be recognized for such amount (P100,000 x 25%). ETHIDa\n\n2. In scenario no. 2, the illustration concluded that there should be no deferred tax entry. However, the difference between the carrying amount of a net defined benefit liability/asset and its tax base, where tax deduction can be claimed for the actual amount of retirement benefits paid to employees, is a temporary difference because any accruals of retirement liability in excess of benefits paid (or contributions in plan assets not yet paid to employees) will still be deductible in future periods when ultimately settled to employees in the future.\n\nIII.

HTcADC\n\nI. Tax Treatment of PAGCOR\n\nSections 13 and 14 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1869 [1] state:\n\n\"Section 13. Exemptions. \u2014\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(2) Income and other taxes. \u2014 (a) Franchise Holder: No tax of any kind or form, income or otherwise, as well as fees, charges or levies of whatever nature, whether National or Local, shall be assessed and collected under this Franchise from the Corporation; nor shall any form of tax or charge attach in any way to the earnings of the Corporation, except a Franchise Tax of five (5%) percent of the gross revenue or earnings derived by the Corporation from its operation under this Franchise. Such tax shall be due and payable quarterly to the National Government and shall be in lieu of all kinds of taxes, levies, fees or assessments of any kind, nature or description, levied, established or collected by any municipal, provincial, or national government authority.\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\nSection 14. Other Conditions. \u2014\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(5) Operation of related services \u2014 The Corporation is authorized to operate such necessary and related services, shows and entertainment. Any income that may be realized from these related services shall not be included as part of the income of the Corporation for the purpose of applying the franchise tax, but the same shall be considered as a separate income of the Corporation and shall be subject to income tax.\" (Emphases and underscoring supplied)\n\nBelow is PAGCOR's income classifications and their respective taxability:\n\n1. Income from operations under PAGCOR's franchise/gaming operations\n\nIncome from operations under PAGCOR's franchise/gaming operations refers to income derived from issuing and/or granting the license to operate casinos, gaming clubs and other similar recreation or amusement places, gaming pools, i.e., basketball, football, bingo, etc. except jai-alai, whether on land or sea, within the territorial jurisdiction of the Republic of the Philippines; to PAGCOR's Contractees and Licensees, as well as earnings derived by PAGCOR from its own operations under its franchise (Sections 10 and 13 (2) of PD No. 1869). This includes, among others: CAIHTE\n\n(a) Income from its casino operations;\n\n(b) Income from dollar pit operations;\n\n(c) Income from regular bingo operations; and,\n\n(d) Income from mobile bingo operations operated by it, with agents on commission basis. Provided, however, that the agents' commission income shall be subject to regular income tax, and consequently, to withholding tax under existing regulations.\n\nThe above income is subject to five percent (5%) franchise tax under PD No. 1869, as amended, in lieu of all taxes of any kind or form, as well as fees, charges or levies of whatever nature, which necessarily include corporate income tax and VAT.\n\nConsidering that the \"gaming operations\" include granting of licenses to operate casinos, gaming clubs and, etc., regulatory/license fees received by PAGCOR from its Licensees shall be considered income from PAGCOR's operations under its franchise or gaming operations subject to five percent (5%) franchise tax, in lieu of all other taxes, including VAT.\n\n2. Income from other related services/operations or from non-gaming operations\n\nPAGCOR's income from other related services/operations or from non-gaming operations, such as, but not limited to, income from operating necessary and related services, shows and entertainment are subject to corporate income tax pursuant to Section 14 (5) of PD No. 1869, [2] which provides that income derived by PAGCOR from \"other related services\" shall not be included as part of the income of PAGCOR for the purpose of applying the franchise tax, but the same shall be considered as a separate income of PAGCOR and shall be subject to income tax. This shall also be subject to VAT under the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended (Tax Code).\n\n3. Collection and remittance of qualifying fee from players\n\nPAGCOR must also collect a qualifying fee from players and remit the same in accordance with Executive Order No. 48, series of 1993, [3] Revenue Regulations No. 06-1993 and Revenue Memorandum Order No. 14-1993. Pursuant to the mentioned law and revenue issuances, PAGCOR shall issue a check, payable to the Bureau of Treasury and to the credit of the account of the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR), equivalent to the amount of collections for a particular week. This check, together with the necessary supporting documents prescribed by the BIR, shall be issued to the Bureau of Treasury not later than Tuesday following each week. The Bureau of Treasury shall then prepare monthly the corresponding journal voucher and any other necessary documents in favor of the BIR for the latter to record the amount of collections in its book of accounts. aScITE\n\nPAGCOR shall file an annual report with the BIR Office having jurisdiction over it within thirty (30) days after the close of the taxable year, summarizing all qualifying fees it has collected from its players for the taxable period.\n\nII. Tax Treatment of PAGCOR Licensees and Contractees\n\nTo reiterate, Sections 13 (2) of PD No. 1869 states:\n\n\"Section 13. Exemptions. \u2014\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(2) Income and other taxes. \u2014 (a) Franchise Holder: No tax of any kind or form, income or otherwise, as well as fees, charges or levies of whatever nature, whether National or Local, shall be assessed and collected under this Franchise from the Corporation; nor shall any form of tax or charge attach in any way to the earnings of the Corporation, except a Franchise Tax of five (5%) percent of the gross revenue or earnings derived by the Corporation from its operation under this Franchise. Such tax shall be due and payable quarterly to the National Government and shall be in lieu of all kinds of taxes, levies, fees or assessments of any kind, nature or description, levied, established or collected by any municipal, provincial, or national government authority.\n\n(b) Others: The exemptions herein granted for earnings derived from the operations conducted under the franchise specifically from the payment of any tax, income or otherwise, as well as any form of charges, fees or levies, shall inure to the benefit of and extend to corporation(s), association(s), agency(ies), or individual(s) with whom the Corporation or operator has any contractual relationship in connection with the operations of the casino(s) authorized to be conducted under this Franchise and to those receiving compensation or other remuneration from the Corporation or operator as a result of essential facilities furnished and/or technical services rendered to the Corporation or operator. x x x\" (Underscoring supplied)\n\nIn the recent en banc decision of the Supreme Court in the consolidated cases of Saint Wealth Ltd. v. Bureau of Internal Revenue and Marco Polo Enterprises Limited v. Secretary of Finance, [4] citing also the case of Bloomberry Resorts and Hotels, Inc. v. Bureau of Internal Revenue, [5] the Supreme Court unequivocally affirmed the applicability of the tax exemption provisions of PD No. 1869, as amended, to both PAGCOR's Contractees and Licensees, to wit: DETACa\n\n\"Considering the above-cited provisions, this Court clarified in Bloomberry Resorts and Hotels, Inc. v. Bureau of Internal Revenue (Bloomberry), that PAGCOR's tax privilege of paying only a five percent (5%) franchise tax for income generated from its gaming operations, in lieu of all other taxes, inures to the benefit of PAGCOR's licensees:\n\n'As the PAGCOR Charter states in unequivocal terms that exemptions granted for earnings derived from the operations conducted under the franchise specifically from the payment of any tax, income or otherwise, as well as any form of charges, fees or levies, shall inure to the benefit of and extend to corporation(s), association(s), agency(ies), or individual(s) with whom the PAGCOR or operator has any contractual relationship in connection with the operations of the casino(s) authorized to be conducted under this Franchise, so it must be that all contractees and licensees of PAGCOR, upon payment of the 5% franchise tax, shall likewise be exempted from all other taxes, including corporate income tax realized from the operation of casinos.\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\nPlainly, too, upon payment of the 5% franchise tax, petitioner's income from its gaming operations of gambling casinos, gaming clubs and other similar recreation or amusement places, and gaming pools, defined within the purview of the aforesaid section, is not subject to corporate income tax.'\" (Underscoring supplied)\n\nIn light of the recent jurisprudence, income received by: (1) PAGCOR from its gaming operations; and (2) PAGCOR's Contractees and Licensees from their gaming operations, is subject to five percent (5%) franchise tax, in lieu of all other national and local taxes, including indirect taxes such as VAT.\n\nOn the other hand, income derived by PAGCOR, its Licensees and Contractees from other related services/operations or from non-gaming operations shall be subject to corporate income tax and VAT.\n\nIII. Tax Treatment of PAGCOR's Licensees Located in Ecozones/Freeports\n\nFor Licensees that are located in Ecozones/Freeports, their income realized from:\n\n1. Income from gaming operations.\n\nIncome from gaming operations shall not be subject to the Special Corporate Income Tax (SCIT), Income Tax Holiday (ITH), or corporate income tax but remains subject to five percent (5%) franchise tax, in lieu of all other taxes, including VAT, in accordance with PD No. 1869, as amended, and the aforecited jurisprudence. HEITAD\n\n2. Other related services/operations, or non-gaming operations, that are covered by their registered activity with the concerned Investment Promotion Agency (IPA).\n\na. If PAGCOR's Licensee is under the five percent (5%) SCIT, such income shall be exempt from regular corporate income tax and VAT.\n\nb. If PAGCOR's Licensee is under the ITH, such income shall be exempt from corporate income tax. The same, however, shall be subject to VAT.\n\n3. Other related services/operations, or non-gaming operations, that are not covered by their registered activity with the concerned IPA.\n\nIncome received by PAGCOR Licensees from other related services/operations or from non-gaming operations that are not covered by their registered activity with the concerned IPA shall be subject to regular corporate income tax, VAT and other applicable taxes under the Tax Code.\n\nIV. Remittance of the Franchise Tax to the BIR\n\nPAGCOR's Licensees/Contractees shall remit the five percent (5%) franchise tax to the BIR and shall be made directly to the Revenue District Office where the licensee or contractee is registered. The licensee and contractee shall remit the franchise tax to the BIR using BIR Form No. 2553 indicating the Alphanumeric Tax Code OT 010.\n\nLicense fees are different and distinct from franchise tax. The license fee is being paid by virtue of the license entered into by and between the licensees and PAGCOR based on the aggregate gross gaming revenue. Said fee is the consideration for the authority granted by PAGCOR to its licensees to establish and operate a casino. On the other hand, the five percent (5%) franchise tax is the tax incentive provided to PAGCOR and its licensees and contractees for its income from gaming operations, which is properly collected by and within the jurisdiction of the BIR and concerned Local Government Units pursuant to Department of Finance Department Order No. 03-08 issued on February 13, 2008.

This Circular, however, shall apply prospectively.\n\nAll internal revenue officers, employees and others concerned are hereby enjoined to strictly implement the provision of this Circular. aDSIHc\n\nThis Circular takes effect immediately.\n\n(SGD.)

                                    "Details": "I. BACKGROUND\n\nSection 30 of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended, (\"Tax Code\") expressly exempts the following corporations in respect to income received by them as such, to wit: aDSIHc\n\n(A) Labor, agricultural or horticultural organization not organized principally for profit;\n\n(B) Mutual savings bank not having a capital stock represented by shares, and cooperative bank without capital stock organized and operated for mutual purposes and without profit;\n\n(C) A beneficiary society, order or association, operating for the exclusive benefit of the members such as a fraternal organization operating under the lodge system, or a mutual aid association or a non-stock corporation organized by employees providing for the payment of life, sickness, accident, or other benefits exclusively to the members of such society, order, or association, or non-stock corporation or their dependents;\n\n(D) Cemetery company owned and operated exclusively for the benefit of its members;\n\n(E) Non-stock corporation or association organized and operated exclusively for religious, charitable, scientific, athletic, or cultural purposes, or for the rehabilitation of veterans, no part of its net income or asset shall belong to or inure to the benefit of any member, organizer, officer or any specific person;\n\n(F) Business league, chamber of commerce, or board of trade, not organized for profit and no part of the net income of which inures to the benefit of any private stockholder or individual;\n\n(G) Civic league or organization not organized for profit but operated exclusively for the promotion of social welfare;\n\n(H) A non-stock and non-profit educational institution;\n\n(I) Government educational institution;\n\n(J) Farmers' or other mutual typhoon or fire insurance company, mutual ditch or irrigation company, mutual or cooperative telephone company, or like organization of a purely local character, the income of which consists solely of assessments, dues, and fees collected from members for the sole purpose of meeting its expenses; and\n\n(K) Farmers', fruit growers', or like association organized an operated as a sales agent for the purpose of marketing the products of its members and turning back to them the proceeds of sales, less the necessary selling expenses on the basis of the quantity of produce furnished by them. ATICcS\n\nThis provision is implemented in Revenue Memorandum Order (RMO) No. 38-2019 wherein it clarifies the nature, character and tax treatment of such corporations. To ensure that the corporation falls within the contemplation of the Tax Code, the said RMO outlines the guidelines in the processing and issuance of a Certificate of Tax Exemption (CTE).\n\nAlso, RMO No. 38-2019 states that a CTE shall be valid for a period of three (3) years from the date of its effectivity, unless sooner revoked or cancelled except for Section 30 (H) of the Tax Code. The CTE may be revalidated under the same procedure set forth in the RMO.\n\nThe Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) noticed that there is still confusion as to the validity period of a CTE considering the implementation of other laws and revenue issuances. Thus, this Circular is issued to clarify the application of the three (3)-year validity period of issued CTEs mentioned in RMO No. 38-2019.\n\nII. CLARIFICATION\n\nPursuant to prevailing laws and revenue issuances, the three (3)-year validity period provided in RMO No. 38-2019 shall not apply to the CTE of the following corporations:\n\n(1) Non-stock and non-profit educational institutions as provided under Section 30 (H) of the Tax Code and RMO No. 044-2016;\n\n(2) Homeowners' Association as provided under Republic Act (RA) No. 9904 [1] and Revenue Memorandum Circular (RMC) No. 09-2013, as amended; and\n\n(3) Non-stock savings and loan association as provided under RA No. 8367 [2] and RMC No. 9-2016.\n\nFurthermore, the three (3)-year validity period shall not apply to the issued CTE, or otherwise known as Certificate of Qualification, of an employees' retirement benefit plan created under RA No. 4917 [3] and Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 1-68, as amended by RR No. 1-83.\n\nTherefore, issued CTEs of the above-enumerated corporations and employees' retirement benefit plan shall remain valid and effective unless recalled or revoked by the BIR for valid grounds. If there are material changes in the character, purpose or method of operation of the corporation or in the provisions of the employees' retirement benefit plan which are inconsistent with the basis for income tax exemption, the CTE shall be subject to revalidation. ETHIDa\n\nAll revenue officials, employees, and others concerned are hereby enjoined to give this Circular as wide publicity as possible.\n\nThis Circular takes effect immediately.\n\n(SGD.) ROMEO D.

                                    "Details": "This Circular is being issued to clarify and address concerns in the risk-based approach verification and processing of VAT refund claims pursuant to Section 112 (A) of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997 (Tax Code), as amended by Republic Act No. 11976 or the Ease of Paying Taxes (EOPT) Act, and as implemented by Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 05-2024, and Revenue Memorandum Order (RMO) No. 23-2024, as amended by RMO No. 42-2024. HTcADC\n\nQ1: Is the submission of all documentary requirements mandated in the Checklist of Mandatory Requirements for VAT refund purposes prescribed under Annex \"A.1\" of Revenue Memorandum Circular (RMC) No. 71-2023 required regardless of the identified risk level?\n\nA1: Yes. All documentary requirements mandated by the BIR for purposes of VAT refund under Section 112 (A) of the Tax Code shall be submitted by the taxpayer regardless of the identified risk level. The determination of the risk level of the VAT refund claim can only be established once the application is officially received by the appropriate BIR processing office, inasmuch as the amount of claim, period covered, frequency of filing, among others, are already ascertained.\n\nQ2: What constitutes the submission of complete documentary requirements for purposes of VAT refund claims and what is the consequence for non-compliance thereof?\n\nA2: The submission of complete documentary requirements shall be based on the completeness of documents as enumerated in the Checklist of Mandatory Requirements (Annex A.1). Non-compliance with the completeness of mandatory requirements shall result in the non-acceptance of the VAT refund application.\n\nQ3: With the number of documents required in the said Checklist of Mandatory Requirements which are sometimes voluminous, how can the receiving office ensure that all documents are indeed submitted?\n\nA3: During checklisting of submitted documents, the receiving offices shall perform the following procedures: CAIHTE\n\na. Check the completeness and propriety in the accomplishment of the application form for VAT refund particularly those falling under \"General Requirements\";\n\nb. Check if the schedules comply with the prescribed format and that the required supporting documents are present but without confirmation if all the indicated transactions (e.g., sales, purchases) are individually supported.\n\nOnce all the documentary requirements were checked as submitted, the application for refund is accepted and the cursory checking of the completeness of documents supporting sales and purchases shall be done after acceptance.\n\nQ4: When does the 90-day period to process VAT refund claims start?\n\nA4: The 90-day period to process and decide shall start from the time of acceptance of the processing office of the claim/application for VAT refund with complete documentary requirements as a result of the checklisting procedure as discussed in Q&A No. 3.\n\nQ5: What is the difference between the \"Checklisting\" procedure as compared to the \"Verification\" procedure?\n\nA5: Checklisting procedure is the initial stage in the processing of VAT refund claims and is limited only to ensuring the completeness of the submitted documentary requirements by the taxpayer-claimant. This includes the procedure being done prior to acceptance of the application and the cursory checking of the completeness of the supporting documents submitted for sales of goods, sales of services and purchases, which is done after the acceptance of the application. This supersedes the verification procedures under Item 5 of Annex D.1 (sales of goods), Item 5 of Annex E (sale of services), and Item 3 of Annex F (purchases) under RMO No. 23-2023.\n\nVerification procedure, on the other hand, is the process that ensures the correctness and accuracy of documents, involving thorough examination, evaluation and a deeper level of analysis and investigation. This includes the verification procedures for claims under Section 112 (A) of the Tax Code, as amended, as outlined in Annex C.1 of RMO No. 23-2023.\n\nQ6: With the enactment of the EOPT Act, will there be changes in the sequence of processing of VAT refund claims?\n\nA6: Yes. VAT refund claims have to be classified as to low-, medium-, or high-risk claims. The sequence in the processing of VAT refund claims shall now be as follows: aScITE\n\n1. Checklisting based on the Checklist of Mandatory Requirements;\n\n2. Cursory checking of completeness of supporting documents submitted for sales and purchases of goods and services after the application has been accepted;\n\n3. Determination of the risk level of the claim;\n\n4. Processing and verification for medium and high-risk claims. For low-risk claims, these will be automatically recommended for refund, net of the effect of the sales and purchases that are tagged as \"no supporting documents (NSD).\"\n\nQ7: What is the impact of the noted \"NSD\" upon confirmation of the completeness of supporting documents submitted for sales and purchases of goods and services?\n\nA7: Sales and purchases determined to be \"NSD\" (e.g., a supporting document indicated in the schedules cannot be found in the physical documents submitted) during cursory checking of the completeness of the supporting documents, such \"NSD\" shall not be considered as incomplete submission, but the same shall result in the disallowance of the unsubstantiated portion of the sales or purchases regardless of the risk classification.\n\nHowever, in the event that the \"NSD\" for sales and purchases exceeded at least 1% of the total amount of sales (for sale transactions) or total amount of claim (for purchase transactions), the application shall automatically be classified as high-risk and shall require 100% verification.\n\nExample 1: The taxpayer-claimant submitted the following documents in support of its claim for VAT refund amounting to P107,000,000.00:\n\nType of transaction\n\nNo. of transactions per schedules\n\nTotal amount of sales per schedules\n\nTotal amount of noted NSD\n\nPercentage of NSD to the Total Amount of Sales\n\nSales transactions\n\nZero-Rated Sales\n\n300 line item\n\nP500,000,000.00\n\nP5,100,000.00\n\n1.02%\n\nVAT Exempt\n\n50 line item\n\nP2,000,000.00\n\nP50,000.00\n\n2.5%\n\nType of transaction\n\nNo. of transactions per schedules\n\nTotal amount of input VAT claimed per schedules\n\nTotal amount of noted NSD\n\nPercentage of NSD to the/Total Amount of Claim\n\nPurchases\n\nLocal Purchases\n\n1000 line item\n\nP100,000,000.00\n\nP1,500,000.00\n\n1.50%\n\nImportations\n\n100 line item\n\nP7,000,000.00\n\nP100,000.00\n\nResult: The noted NSD for both sales and purchases transactions exceeded the 1% of the total amount of sales and the total amount of claim. Hence, the application shall be automatically classified as high-risk.\n\nExample 2: The taxpayer-claimant submitted the following documents in support of its claim for VAT refund amounting to P7,000,000.00: DETACa\n\nType of transaction\n\nNo. of transactions per schedules\n\nTotal amount of sales per schedules\n\nTotal amount of noted NSD\n\nPercentage of NSD to the Total Amount of Sales\n\nSales transactions\n\nZero-Rated Sales\n\n100 line item\n\nP50,000,000.00\n\nP200,000.00\n\n0.40%\n\nType of transaction\n\nNo. of transactions per schedules\n\nTotal amount of input VAT claimed per schedules\n\nTotal amount of noted NSD\n\nPercentage of NSD to the/Total Amount of Claim\n\nPurchases\n\nLocal Purchases\n\n500 line item\n\nP7,000,000.00\n\nP100,000.00\n\n1.43%\n\nResult: The noted NSD for sales transactions did not exceed the 1% of the total amount of sales but did exceed 1% of the total amount of claim for purchases transactions. Hence, the application shall still be automatically classified as high-risk.\n\nQ8: What will be the treatment on missing/incomplete information in the schedules of sales and purchases submitted?\n\nA8: Applications with missing/incomplete information (e.g., no reference details, incomplete/no transaction details, etc.) in the schedules of sales and purchases shall automatically be classified as high-risk claim and shall require 100% verification pursuant to RMO No. 42-2024.\n\nQ9: What is the meaning of \"No Verification\" on the scope of verification of Sales and Purchases for \"Low-risk\" claims?\n\nA9: Processing of VAT refund claims classified as low-risk shall be limited only to the checklisting and completeness of documentary requirements under the Checklist of Mandatory Requirements. Verification procedures for sales of goods and services as well as purchases and input tax shall no longer be performed.\n\nQ10: What should the assigned Revenue Officer (RO) do if they notice any potential findings during the processing of VAT refund claims for Low-risk claims?\n\nA10: If the assigned Revenue Officer (RO) notices any potential findings during the processing of the VAT refund claims (e.g., possible findings from AFS disclosures, discrepancies in the amounts reported in the VAT returns, etc.), these findings shall be: HEITAD\n\na. Endorsed for further verification and/or consolidation with the existing audit if the processing is conducted by an Office other than the BIR office that has jurisdiction over the claimant; or\n\nb. Incorporate to the existing audit for the taxable year covered by the claim if processed within the same BIR office that has jurisdiction over the claimant.\n\nMoreover, the RO shall mention in his/her memorandum report the findings noted and the endorsement for further verification.\n\nQ11: What verification procedures to be observed for \"Medium-risk\" and \"High-risk\" claims?\n\nA11:  For both medium-risk and high-risk claims, the verification procedures outlined in RMO No. 23-2023 shall still apply, with the exception of sales and purchases transactions not included in the required percentage of documents to be verified for medium-risk claims.\n\nQ12: What will be the treatment on local suppliers with input VAT claimed that are not selected for verification but are identified as Cannot Be Located (CBL) taxpayers and/or included in the Run After Fake Transactions (RAFT) program for Medium-risk claims?\n\nA12: Input VAT claimed from local suppliers that are not selected for verification but are identified as CBL taxpayers shall not be allowed and shall form part of the disallowance of the claim pursuant to Revenue Memorandum Circular (RMC) No. 29-2023.\n\nSimilarly, input VAT claimed from local suppliers not selected for verification but included in the RAFT program shall not be allowed, leading to outright disallowance for those identified suppliers.\n\nThe local suppliers identified as CBL taxpayers and/or included in the RAFT program shall be included for disallowance, in addition to the selected suppliers not included thereto.\n\nQ13: What is the effectivity of this Circular?\n\nA13: This Circular shall take effect immediately upon posting in the BIR Website.\n\nMoreover, this shall cover on-going VAT refund claims currently being processed by the appropriate processing office/s and were not endorsed for review by the reviewing offices upon the issuance of this Circular.\n\nAll revenue issuances inconsistent herewith are hereby considered amended, modified or revoked accordingly. aDSIHc\n\nAll internal revenue officers, employees and others concerned are hereby enjoined to strictly implement the provision of this Circular.\n\n(SGD.)

BACKGROUND\n\nUnder Executive Order (EO) No. 64, series of 2024, [1] medical allowance in an amount not exceeding seven thousand pesos (PhP7,000.00) per annum shall be granted to each qualified government civilian personnel as a subsidy for the availment of health maintenance organization (HMO)-type benefits beginning FY 2025. The medical allowance benefit shall be categorized under Standard Allowances and Benefits component of the Total Compensation Framework embodied in Joint Resolution No. 4, series of 2009 [n] and Republic Act No. 11466, otherwise known as the \"Salary Standardization Law of 2019.\" ATICcS\n\nThe above medical allowance benefit applies to all civilian government personnel in the Executive, Legislative and Judicial Branches, Constitutional Commissions and other Constitutional Offices, government-owned or -controlled corporations not covered by Republic Act No. 10149, and local government units, regardless of appointment status, whether regular, contractual or casual, appointive or elective, and on full-time or part-time basis. Excluded from the grant of the medical allowance benefit are the government officials and employees who are already receiving HMO-based health care services by virtue of special laws and officials and employees in the legislative and judicial branches and other offices vested with fiscal autonomy.\n\nII. TAXABILITY OF MEDICAL ALLOWANCE\n\nSection 2.78.1 (A) (3) of Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 2-98, as amended, provides that de minimis benefits furnished or offered by an employer to his employees for the promotion of their health, goodwill, contentment, or efficiency are not considered as compensation subject to income tax and, consequently, to withholding tax.\n\nAmong the de minimis benefits under RR No. 2-98, as amended, is the actual medical assistance, e.g., medical allowance to cover medical and healthcare needs, annual medical/executive check-up, maternity assistance, and routine consultations, not exceeding PhP10,000.00 per annum.\n\nTo prevent any ambiguity, the medical allowance benefit granted under EO No. 64, series of 2024, falls under the de minimis benefit contemplated under Section 2.78.1 (A) (3) of RR No. 2-98, as amended. ETHIDa\n\nSuch being the case, the actual premium paid to HMO providers in compliance with EO No. 64, series of 2024, is exempt from income tax, and, consequently, to withholding tax pursuant to Section 2.78.1 (A) (3) of RR No. 2-98, as amended. However, medical allowance benefits given in excess of PhP10,000.00 (the maximum amount allowed as de minimis benefits for medical assistance) shall be included as part of \"other benefits\" which is subject to the PhP90,000.00 ceiling. [2] Any amount in excess of the PhP90,000.00 threshold shall be subject to income tax, and, consequently, to the withholding tax on compensation.\n\nIII. REPEALING CLAUSE\n\nAll revenue circulars inconsistent herewith are hereby considered amended, modified or revoked accordingly.\n\nAll internal revenue officers, employees and others concerned are hereby enjoined to strictly implement the provision of this Circular.\n\nThis Circular takes effect immediately.\n\n(SGD.)

                                    "Details": "In the implementation of Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 48-2024 which prescribed the policies and procedures in the proper manner of accomplishing the new version of the monthly Documentary Stamp Tax Declaration/Return (BIR Form No. 2000 version 2018), certain issues/concerns were raised by taxpayers-users who are using the electronic Documentary Stamp Tax System (eDST System) and who are filing the said form thru the electronic Filing and Payment System (eFPS). aScITE\n\nAccordingly, this Circular is hereby issued to clarify and address the respective issues/concerns, as follows:\n\n1. Issue: The additional requirement of filing BIR Form No. 2000 for declaring their total DST due from all taxable documents that were made, signed, accepted or transferred during the month considering that these taxable transactions are already encoded in the taxpayers' ledger of the eDST System as utilizations from their advance deposits.\n\nClarification: It is a well settled rule that, in general, a tax return is an official form containing the prescribed details in computing the tax due that the taxpayer should pay to the taxing authority. Currently, BIR Form No. 2000, when used for the remittance of advance deposits by taxpayers-users of eDST System, is not yet a return, but as a payment form. Due to certain limitations of the current format of BIR Form No. 2000 version 2018, the same form shall still be used separately in declaring the taxable transactions in the computation of the total DST due of these taxpayers-users, pending the revision of the said form.\n\n2. Issue: Due to the voluminous transactions of certain taxpayers-users, the encoding process of these transactions in Schedule 1 (Summary of Computation of Taxes Due for the Month) of the said form suddenly suspends (i.e., continuously buffer or \"hang\") after an initial number of encoded transactions which compels the taxpayers-users to terminate the encoding process. However, upon resumption, the previously encoded transactions were already lost.\n\nRevised Procedures: Considering that the taxable transactions of the taxpayers are already captured by the eDST System when the corresponding tax dues are utilized as deductions from the advance deposit and for purposes of addressing the technical limitations of the eFPS in accomplishing Schedule 1 of the form involving voluminous transactions, the encoding of the Alphanumeric Tax Code (ATC) No. 010 and the amount under the \"Tax Due\" column equivalent to the total tax due for the month reflected in the taxpayer's ledger of said system shall be sufficient in the accomplishment of the said schedule.\n\n3. Issue: Inability to generate the form or delay in filing the declaration by the reason of several attempts to finally accomplish Schedule I and generate the form considering that only five (5) days (i.e., prescribed number of days after the close of the month) within which to file the form. As a consequence, the eFPS automatically computes the penalties due to late filing of the form within the prescribed deadline, the obvious reason of which should not be attributed to the taxpayer. DETACa\n\nClarification: The filing of BIR Form No. 2000, when used as declaration for taxable transactions in computing the total DST due, is a compliance requirement as a tax return and it is not being used in paying the total DST due. Necessarily, the eDST taxpayer-user cannot be held liable for penalties computed by the eFPS because the DST dues were already paid in advance in the form of deposit and the utilizations thereof can be validated from the eDST system. Considering that the eFPS has no facility to distinguish whether the said form is being filed as a tax return or as a declaration, the corresponding amount for compromise penalty for late filing of the said form as a declaration shall be the proper penalty of the eDST user.\n\n4. Issue: The total penalty computed by eFPS is based on the total tax due which is a very significant amount on the part of the taxpayers as it is not proportion to the violation of filing of a simple declaration within the prescribed deadline.\n\nClarification: Considering the technical limitations of the eFPS in accomplishing Schedule 1 of the said form involving voluminous transactions, the compromise penalties which are otherwise due resulting from non-filing or late filing by eDST taxpayers-users of the said form as declaration covering the previous taxable months from the date of issuance of RMC No. 48-2024 shall no longer be assessed and collected.\n\nAll internal revenue officials, employees and others concerned are hereby enjoined to give this Circular as wide publicity as possible.

                                    "Details": "BACKGROUND\n\nIn 2008, Revenue Memorandum Order (RMO) No. 13-2008 (now Revenue Regulations No. 2-2023) was issued prescribing the use of Constructive System/Receipt System (CS/RS) for certificates being issued by government agencies and its instrumentalities, including local government units, to address the unavailability of loose stamps and the technical and operational inadequacies of Documentary Stamp Electronic Imprinting Machine (DSEIM). The temporary use of CS/RS was likewise prescribed for DSEIM users under RMO No. 14-2008, in order to address the loading limitation of these machines, until it was revoked effective January 1, 2010 by Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 7-2009, when the eDST System was implemented replacing the DSEIMs. HTcADC\n\nWhile RR No. 7-2009 has identified industry sectors that are mandated to use the eDST System, it was noted that certain taxpayers failed to enroll and use the said system. It was later discovered that these taxpayers have either continued to use the CS/RS or purchased and affixed loose documentary stamps on their taxable documents.\n\nFurther, the following incidents were recently reported to this Bureau:\n\n1. Sale of loose DST through online platforms or physical stores.\n\n2. Affixture of both spurious eDST system-printed stamps and loose documentary stamps to taxable documents.\n\n3. Affixture of loose documentary stamps to taxable documents by eDST System taxpayers-users instead of the system-generated stamp.\n\n4. Affixture of loose documentary stamps to taxable documents with DST due of more than P15.00 (now P30.00) in violation of RR No. 15-2001.\n\nGUIDELINES ON THE PROPER SALE AND AFFIXTURE OF LOOSE DOCUMENTARY STAMPS\n\nIn order to address these incidents, this Circular is hereby issued to prescribe the following policies and procedures for strict compliance by all concerned taxpayers and revenue personnel of this Bureau:\n\n1. The affixture of loose documentary stamps to taxable documents shall not apply to the following taxable documents/transactions: CAIHTE\n\na. One-Time Transaction (ONETT);\n\nb. Taxable documents issued in the regular operations of mandated taxpayers-users of the eDST System of this Bureau; and\n\nc. Certificates covered by the CS/RS under RR No. 2-2023.\n\n2. Loose documentary stamps shall only be purchased from and sold by the authorized Specialized Revenue Collecting Officers (SRCO)/Revenue Collection Officers (RCO) assigned at the National Office and Revenue District Office of this Bureau.\n\nIn order that the amount of the daily proceeds from sale of loose documentary stamps are uploaded as collections to the Collection and Bank Reconciliation of the Integrated Tax System (CBR-ITS)/Collection, Remittance and Reconciliation of the Internal Revenue Integrated System (CRR-IRIS), an electronic Revenue Official Receipt (eROR) or manual ROR, in case of unavailability of the Mobile Revenue Collection Officer System (MRCOS) and/or the Collection Officer Receipting Device (CORD), shall be generated by the SRCO/RCO covering all sales of documentary stamps for the day. The RCO/SRCO shall use the Taxpayer Identification Number of the Revenue District Office in the issuance of said receipts, and the inclusive series of the loose documentary stamps sold shall be indicated in the \"REMARKS\" field of the MRCOS.\n\n3. A single piece of loose documentary stamp shall only be purchased and sold by the SRCO/RCO for each taxable document with DST due of not exceeding P30.00. In addition, the SRCO/RCO shall undertake the following procedures:\n\na. Require the presentation of the original copy of the duly signed taxable document to which the documentary stamp tax is to be affixed;\n\nb. Affix the loose documentary stamp to the lower portion of the taxable document;\n\nc. Cancel the stamp by writing two lines across the stamp and extending to portions of the document to which it is affixed, and indicating the date of affixture thereto by perforation as to render it unreusable. In case of unavailability of a perforating device, it shall be sufficient that the date of affixture may be indicated through a mechanical dater, rubber stamp or by hand writing; and\n\nd. Release the taxable document with the duly cancelled documentary stamp. aScITE\n\nHowever, for those taxpayers who issue taxable documents with tax due of not more than P30.00 such as schools and universities, except those taxpayers who are using the eDST System and those taxpayers covered by RR No. 2-2023, they shall be allowed to purchase two or more pieces of loose documentary stamps, provided that the following requirements shall be complied with:\n\na. The taxpayer shall submit to the SRCO/RCO a written letter with its official letterhead duly signed by the taxpayer or its authorized representative requesting the purchase of loose documentary stamps, with the following information:\n\ni. Name and address of the requesting taxpayer;\n\nii. Taxpayer Identification Number;\n\niii. Number of loose documentary stamps being purchased;\n\niv. The purpose for which the loose documentary stamps shall be used; and\n\nv. Name of taxable document on which the loose documentary stamps shall be affixed to.\n\nIn subsequent purchases, the previously purchased stamps shall be liquidated and included in the letter, as follows:\n\nBeginning Balances\n\nStamps Purchased\n\nStamps Affixed\n\nEnding Balances\n\nCount\n\nSerial Numbers\n\nCount\n\nDate\n\nCount\n\nPeriod Covered\n\nSerial Numbers\n\nCount\n\nSerial Numbers\n\nb. The SRCO/RCO shall issue an eROR or manual ROR, as the case may be, with the amount equivalent to the total value of the loose documentary stamps being purchased;\n\nc. The SRCO/RCO shall issue ONLY loose documentary stamps in sequential serial numbers for bulk purchases of these stamps. Accordingly, the SRCO/RCO shall maintain two (2) separate sheets of stamps with one sheet assigned for single-piece purchases of stamps and the other sheet for bulk purchases of stamps.\n\nd. Based on the information indicated in the purchase letters of the taxpayers, a record, in hard or soft copy, shall be maintained by the SRCO/RCO using the following format: DETACa\n\nTP Name\n\nAddress\n\nTIN\n\nBeginning Balances\n\nNo. of Stamps Purchased\n\nNo. of Stamps Affixed\n\nEnding Balances\n\nCount\n\nSerial Nos.\n\nCount\n\nDate\n\nCount\n\nPeriod Covered\n\nSerial Numbers\n\nCount\n\nSerial Nos.\n\n4. Original copies of surety bonds issued for excise tax purposes with documentary stamp imprinted by the eDST System shall not be accepted and recorded by the concerned offices of this Bureau, unless the name of the issuing company has been validated from the concerned revenue office as a duly enrolled taxpayer to the eDST System and the DST due from the surety bond is deducted from the taxpayer's ledger in the said system.\n\nAll internal revenue officials, employees and others concerned are hereby enjoined to give this Circular as wide publicity as possible.\n\nThis Circular shall take effect immediately.\n\n(SGD.)

                                    "Details": "I. BACKGROUND\n\nSection 2, Article X of the 1987 Philippine Constitution [1] (\"Constitution\") and Section 22 (d) of Republic Act (\"RA\") No. 7160 [2] provides that Local Government Units (\"LGUs\"), being political subdivisions, shall enjoy local autonomy, including full autonomy in the exercise of their proprietary functions and in the management of their economic enterprises. HTcADC\n\nSection 5 of the Constitution and Section 18 of RA No. 7160 provide that LGUs shall have the power to: (1) create its own sources of revenues and to levy taxes, fees and charges subject to such guidelines and limitations as the Congress may provide, consistent with the basic policy of local autonomy. Such taxes, fees and charges shall accrue exclusively for their use and disposition and which shall be retained by them; and (2) acquire, develop, lease, encumber, alienate, or otherwise dispose of real or personal property held by them in their proprietary capacity and to apply their resources and assets for productive, developmental, or welfare purposes, in the exercise or furtherance of their governmental or proprietary powers and functions and thereby ensure their development into self-reliant communities and active participants in the attainment of national goals.\n\nSection 27 (C) of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended (\"Tax Code\"), expressly provides that LGUs (which are considered as a government agency) [3] are liable to pay tax imposed upon their taxable income, to wit:\n\n\"SEC. 27. Rates of income tax on domestic corporations. \u2014\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(C) Government-owned or Controlled Corporations, Agencies or Instrumentalities. \u2014 The provisions of existing special or general laws to the contrary notwithstanding, all corporations, agencies, or instrumentalities owned or controlled by the Government, except the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS), the Social Security System (SSS), the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PHIC), the local water districts (LWD), shall pay such rate of tax upon their taxable income as are imposed by this Section upon corporations or associations engaged in a similar business, industry or activity.\"\n\nHowever, Section 32 (B) (7) (b) of the Tax Code clarified that income derived from the exercise of essential government function accruing to LGUs are exempt from tax, to wit: CAIHTE\n\n\"SEC. 32. Gross Income. \u2014\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(B) Exclusions from gross income. \u2014 The following items shall not be included in gross income and shall be exempt from taxation under this Title:\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(7) Miscellaneous Items.\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(b) Income Derived by the Government or its Political Subdivisions. \u2014 Income derived from any public utility or from the exercise of essential governmental function accruing to the Government of the Philippines or to any political subdivision thereof.\"\n\nHence, it is clear that only the income derived by the LGUs from the performance of its proprietary functions shall be subject to Philippine taxes as are imposed upon corporations or associations engaged in similar business, industry or activity.\n\nThis Circular is, therefore, issued to provide clarification and guidance relating to the imposition of taxes on the proprietary activities of LGUs based on the current laws and recent jurisprudence.\n\nII. FUNCTIONS OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT UNIT\n\nUnder Section 15 of RA No. 7160, LGUs' powers are two-fold in character: (i) governmental, legislative, public, or political; and (ii) proprietary, corporate or private.\n\nA. Governmental Functions\n\nAn LGU is exercising its governmental powers when it is performing acts which administer the powers of the State and promoting public welfare which includes the legislative, judicial, public and political aspects. In its public capacity, a responsibility exists in the performance of acts for the public benefit, and in this respect, it is merely a part of the machinery of government of the sovereignty creating them, and the authority of the state is supreme. [4]\n\nGovernment function is defined as functions of a municipal corporation or a local government unit which are conferred or imposed upon it as a local agency that are essential to its existence in the sense of serving the public and which has for its objective the promotion or advancement of the public health, safety, morals, general welfare, security, prosperity and contentment of the inhabitant or in the performance of a duty imposed by sovereign power. [5]\n\nIn order to establish as to whether an LGU performs a governmental function or not, it has the burden of proving that the objective of its economic endeavor is purely governmental. It must present through evidentiary documents, the purpose of its creation, the manner of its operation, intended recipients of its services or customers and the disposition of its revenues. [6] aScITE\n\nB. Proprietary Functions\n\nProprietary function refers to those that are undertaken only by way of advancing the general interest of society, and merely optional on the government. [7] Proprietary powers are exercised for the special benefit and advantage of the community which include those: (1) that are ministerial, private, and corporate in nature, and not necessary to its existence; and (2) which inure to the advantage of its inhabitants.\n\nSection 2 (5) of Revenue Regulations (\"RR\") No. 18-2012, qualified the acts that are considered performance of proprietary functions of the LGUs:\n\n\"SECTION 2. Definition of Terms. \u2014\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n5. Government Proprietary Function \u2014 for purposes of these Regulations, when a public corporation or a local government unit acts in its proprietary character, it is regarded as having the rights and obligations of a private corporation. For government entities to be taxable, the following requisites must concur: (1) the government entity concerned must not be performing an essential governmental function; and (2) it must be engaged in similar business, industry, or activity as performed by other ordinary taxable corporations. All income realized from or received in the exercise of its proprietary functions shall be subject to income tax and business taxes in the same manner as other private corporations similarly situated.\"\n\nBased on the foregoing, the following requisites must all be present in order for a specific act of LGU to be considered as proprietary in nature:\n\n1. the LGU concerned must not be performing an essential governmental function; and\n\n2. the LGU must be engaged in similar business, industry, or activity as performed by other ordinary taxable corporations.\n\nThere is no hard and fast rule for purposes of determining the true nature of an undertaking or function of an LGU. The surrounding circumstances of a particular case are to be considered and would be decisive. The basic element, no matter how beneficial to the public the undertaking may be, is that it is governmental in essence, otherwise the function becomes private or proprietary in character. [8]\n\nIII. TAX TREATMENT OF INCOME DERIVED FROM THE PERFORMANCE OF PROPRIETARY FUNCTIONS OF LGUs\n\nTo reiterate, any income derived by an LGU acting in its corporate capacity and for the purpose of economic gain and profit (\"Proprietary Income\") shall be subject to tax and treated just like an income of any other private or government corporation. DETACa\n\nWhen LGUs act in its proprietary character, it is regarded as having the rights and obligations of a private corporation. Based on Section 30 of the Tax Code, the income of whatever kind and character of corporations from any of their properties, real or personal, or from any of their activities conducted for profit regardless of the disposition made of such income, shall be subject to tax imposed under the Tax Code. [9]\n\nIt bears stressing that the tax exemption privileges, including preferential tax treatment of all government units, including, for the avoidance of doubt, LGUs, were withdrawn by Presidential Decree No. 1931 (1984) and Executive Order No. 93 (1987). [10]\n\nAs such, the Proprietary Income derived by LGUs shall be subject to the following internal revenue taxes:\n\nA. Income Tax\n\nSection 27 (C) of the Tax Code provides that income derived by LGUs from the performance of proprietary activities are subject to income tax.\n\nIt must be noted that this includes income taxes imposed on passive income under Section 27 (D) of the Tax Code such as, but not limited to, royalties, interests, dividends, sale of shares of stocks, income derived under the expanded foreign currency deposit system, and capital gain realized from sale, exchange, or other disposition of lands and/or buildings which are not actually used in the performance of such LGU's governmental functions.\n\nB. Withholding tax\n\nWhile it is true that under Section 2.57.5 (A) of RR No. 2-98, withholding of creditable withholding tax shall not apply to income payments made to the national government and its instrumentalities, including provincial, city or municipal governments, this rule only applies to income payments received by the LGU in the performance of its governmental functions.\n\nAs discussed above, Proprietary Income shall be taxed the same just like any other private or government corporation. Hence, income payments to LGUs by reason of performance of proprietary functions shall be subject to withholding tax pursuant to RR No. 2-98.\n\nC. VAT\n\nSection 105 of the Tax Code provides for the persons liable to VAT, to wit: HEITAD\n\n\"SEC. 105. Persons Liable. \u2014 Any person who, in the course of trade or business, sells, barters, exchanges, leases goods or properties, renders services, and any person who imports goods shall be subject to the value-added tax (VAT) imposed in Sections 106 to 108 of this Code.\"\n\nMoreover, Section 108 of the Tax Code provides for the tax rate and tax base of VAT on sale of services:\n\n\"SEC. 108. Value-Added Tax on Sale of Services and Use or Lease of Properties. \u2014\n\n(A) Rate and Base of Tax. \u2014 There shall be levied, assessed and collected, a value-added tax equivalent to twelve percent (12%) of the gross sales derived from the sale or exchange of services, including the use or lease of properties;\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\nThe phrase 'sale or exchange or services' means the performance of all kinds of services in the Philippines, for others for a fee, remuneration or consideration, x x x\"\n\nWhen LGUs perform corporate or private function that is proprietary in nature, it shall be held liable to twelve percent (12%) VAT on the total gross sales it derived from such activity. [11]\n\nD. Other Percentage Taxes\n\nIncome derived by LGUs from the performance of its proprietary function that falls under Title V of the Tax Code shall be subject to percentage tax based on the percentage tax rates provided therein.\n\nE. DST\n\nLGUs entering into private contracts/agreements relating to its performance of corporate or private function that is proprietary in nature, similar with private corporations, shall be held liable for DST under the Tax Code.\n\nFor transactions subject to the above internal revenue taxes, LGUs shall issue the appropriate invoice/s complying with the requirements under Section 237 of the Tax Code, as amended by RA No. 11976, otherwise known as the \"Ease of Paying Taxes Act,\" and as implemented by RR No. 7-2024 and other existing rules and regulations. Hence, they shall apply for Authority to Print in the printing of their principal and supplementary invoices following the procedure under RR No. 7-2024 and other relevant revenue issuances.\n\nIV. APPLICATION OF TAXES\n\nA. Sale of properties that are no longer intended for governmental use\n\nUnder Section 27 (D) (5) of the Tax Code, it is provided that in the case of sale, exchange, or other disposition of lands and/or buildings which are not actually used in business and are treated as capital assets by domestic corporations, a final tax of six percent (6%) based on the gross selling price or current fair market value as determined in accordance with Section 6 (E) of the Tax Code, whichever is higher, is imposed upon capital gains presumed to have been realized therefrom. It must be noted that the said CGT is an income tax, the burden of which rests upon the seller which, in this case, is the LGU. aDSIHc\n\nIt is noteworthy to mention that LGU is subject to the CGT of 6% imposed on its capital gains presumed to have been realized from the sale of properties despite of its being a government entity. This is in accordance with Section 32 (B) (7) (b) of the Tax Code which provides that only the income derived by the LGU from the exercise of its essential governmental function shall be excluded from its gross income. [12]\n\nB. Leasing of properties\n\nLeasing of property to a private person and/or entity for it to construct, develop and operate a commercial activity is primarily an economic activity with a view to obtaining profit. The LGU in this case acts in its proprietary or private character since no governmental or public policy of the state is involved. [13]\n\nC. Exchange of properties\n\nIt has been the consistent stance of this Office that an exchange of properties between two (2) parties is subject to CGT and the corresponding DST based on the fair market value of their respective properties as determined in accordance with Section 6 (E) of the Tax Code. If the exchange of properties between the LGU and the private person/entity relating to a commercial activity partakes the nature of voluntary exchange, it is subject to the aforesaid taxes. [14]\n\nAccordingly, the private person/entity may opt to report the gain realized in the exchange in the manner provided for under Section 24 (A) (1) of the Tax Code. Under Section 24 (D) (1) of the Tax Code, an individual taxpayer has the option to report his tax liabilities, if any, on gains realized on dispositions of real property to the government or any of its political subdivisions or agencies either as a transaction subject to CGT of 6% under Section 24 (D) (1) of the Tax Code, or under Sec. 24 (A) (1) thereof and the corresponding DST prescribed in Section 196 of the same Code.\n\nOn the other hand, the LGU shall be subject to the CGT of 6% imposed under Section 27 (D) (5) of the Tax Code on the capital gains presumed to have been realized from the said exchange transaction of real property considered as capital assets. This is because only the income derived by the LGU from the exercise of its essential governmental function shall be excluded from its gross income pursuant to Sec. 32 (B) (7) (b) of the Tax Code. [15] ATICcS\n\nD. Interest from deposits and yield or any other monetary benefit from deposit substitutes and from trust funds and similar arrangements and royalties.\n\nThe obligation of LGU to maintain depository accounts for its funds may not be construed as part of its essential governmental functions since this is not exercised in \"administering the powers of the state and promoting the public welfare\" nor is it included among the \"legislative, judicial, public or political\" powers of the LGU. It is in the nature of a function \"for the special benefit and advantage of the city or municipality\" and, hence, proprietary in character. [16]\n\nWith regard to investments, it appears that an LGU engages primarily in an economic activity with a view to obtaining profit when it maintains investments. The City acts in its proprietary or private character since no governmental or public policy of the state is involved. [17]\n\nThe LGU is subject to the twenty percent (20%) final tax on its interest income derived from its deposit accounts and yield and other monetary benefit from its investments in government securities, commercial papers and similar arrangements under Section 27 (D) (1) of the Tax Code.\n\nE. The forfeiture of or purchase by the LGU in the public auction of properties due to delinquency in real property taxes.\n\nThe transaction shall be subject to CGT based on the bid price in the auction sale or the zonal value of the foreclosed property, whichever is higher.\n\nThe Declaration of Forfeiture is subject to DST under Section 196 of the Tax Code, since upon registration of this document with the Office of the Registry of Deeds, the Registrar of Deeds is duty bound to transfer the title of the forfeited property to the LGU pursuant to Section 263 of RA No. 7160. [18]\n\nThe statutory seller in this particular situation is the concerned LGU. Under the Tax Code, the CGT is required to be paid upon consolidation of title over the property by the highest bidder which shall be made after the lapse of one (1)-year redemption period. If redeemed, there is no CGT due. But, if the owner fails to redeem the property, the highest bidder who, in most cases is the statutory seller (LGU), pays the CGT and DST, in order that a property may be registered under its name upon the registration of the certificate of sale. There is no exemption from taxes in case of foreclosure sale. The Tax Code requires payment of CGT/DST even on conditional sales of real property. [19]\n\nV.

                                    "Details": "In line with the Bureau's objective to provide excellent taxpayers service, this Circular is hereby issued to answer the frequently asked questions relative to the filing of tax returns and payment of taxes under Section 3 of Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 4-2024, implementing the provision of Republic Act No. 11976, otherwise known as \"Ease of Paying Taxes (EOPT) Act\" as follows: ETHIDa\n\nQ1. Are existing revenue issuances, mandating certain taxpayers to use the Electronic Filing and Payment (eFPS) in the filing of tax returns and payment of taxes due thereon, repealed by Section 3 of RR No. 4-2024?\n\nA1. No. The previous RR mandating taxpayers to use the eFPS in the filing of tax returns and payment of taxes had not been repealed since it is not in contrary to the provisions of Section 3 of RR No. 4-2024. Likewise, under the said provision, all tax returns shall now be filed electronically.\n\nHence, taxpayers who are already enrolled in the said system shall continue using it. There are, however, taxpayers identified in the previous issuances who are mandated to use eFPS but were not able to enroll in the said system. With the issuance of RR No. 4-2024, these taxpayers shall now have the option to use the eBIRForms facility for them to be able to comply with the electronic filing of tax returns.\n\nTaxpayers already enrolled in the eFPS may only be allowed to use the eBIRForms facility if there is an advisory of the unavailability of the eFPS.\n\nIf the electronic platforms such as eFPS, eBIRForms and Tax Software Providers (TSPs) of the Bureau are not available, manual filing shall be allowed.\n\nQ2. What are the instances in which the taxpayers, who are mandated to file the tax returns electronically, will be allowed to file their returns manually?\n\nA2. Taxpayers who are mandated to file the tax returns electronically shall be allowed to file their returns manually when there is an advisory on the unavailability of the system, when the tax return form is not yet available in any of the electronic filing platforms, or when there is justifiable reason as may be determined by the Commissioner of the Internal Revenue (CIR) or his authorized representative. TIADCc\n\nQ3. In case there is an advisory that the electronic filing/payment platforms are unavailable, are taxpayers mandated to use the same allowed to manually file their tax returns and pay the taxes due anywhere?\n\nA3. Yes. Taxpayers who are mandated to use the eFPS and the eBIRForms are allowed to manually file their tax returns and pay their taxes due to any Revenue Collection Officer (RCO) or Authorized Agent Bank (AAB).\n\nLikewise, taxpayers are reminded that RCOs may only accept cash payments not exceeding P20,000.00. However, there shall be no limit on tax payments made thru checks.\n\nQ4. Considering that the tax return filing is required to be done electronically, how can the attachments to the tax returns be submitted, if any?\n\nA4. The attachments shall likewise be submitted electronically using the Electronic Audited Financial Statements (eAFS)/eSubmission Facility, whichever is applicable. In case of unavailability of said facilities, the attachments can be submitted manually to the BIR district office that has jurisdiction over the taxpayer.\n\nQ5. What are the documents that shall be submitted through eAFS and eSubmission Facility?\n\nA5. Please see Annex \"A\" of this Revenue Memorandum Circular (RMC) for the list of documents that shall be submitted through eAFS and eSubmission Facility.\n\nQ6. With the removal of the twenty-five percent (25%) surcharge for \"wrong venue\" filing, does it mean that the same shall not be imposed on taxpayer who manually paid the tax due to an AAB outside the jurisdiction of the Revenue District Office (RDO) where the taxpayer is registered?\n\nA6. Yes. The twenty-five percent (25%) surcharge shall no longer be imposed as this has already been removed under the EOPT Act.\n\nQ7. What are the available electronic payment (ePay) gateways that taxpayers can use in the payment of their taxes aside from the eFPS?\n\nA7. Listed below are the ePay gateways for tax payment. You can also refer to the BIR website from time to time, for the updated list: cSEDTC\n\n1. Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) Link.Biz Portal \u2014 for taxpayers who have ATM account with LBP and/or holders of BancNet ATM/Debit/Prepaid Card or taxpayer utilizing PESONet facility for depositors of AUB, BPI, PSBank, RCBC, Robinsons Bank and Union Bank;\n\n2. Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) Pay Tax Online \u2014 for holders of Visa/MasterCard Credit Card and/or BancNet ATM/Debit Card;\n\n3. Union Bank of the Philippines (UBP) Online/The Portal Payment Facilities \u2014 for taxpayers who have an account with UBP or InstaPay using UPAY facility (for individual Non-Account holder of UnionBank); or\n\n4.

In most practical applications of Sukuk, the cash flows that investors see is very similar to what they would see when investing in bonds, making Sukuk a suitable alternative for bonds in financing Shari'ah-compliant projects or activities.\n\nThis Circular is being issued to provide the tax treatment of Sukuk pursuant to the tax neutrality provision of Section 14 of RA No. 11439 as implemented by Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 17-2020 for the guidance and observance of all concerned.\n\nGuidelines\n\n1. RR No. 17-2020 requires that Islamic banking transactions are taxed no more heavily (and no more lightly) than conventional banking transactions. Thus, any reference to \"interest\" shall apply to gains or profits received and expenses incurred in Islamic banking arrangements, in lieu of interest income and/or expenses under the conventional banking transactions.\n\n2. Sukuk are defined by Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) as \"certificates of equal value representing undivided shares in ownership of tangible assets, usufructs and services or (in the ownership of) assets of particular projects or special investment activity that is undertaken in accordance with Shari'ah principles. Sukuk are generally named after the Shari'ah principle by which they are structured.\"\n\nThe structure of Sukuk involves the following entities and their roles:\n\na) Originator \u2014 the entity or entities that wish to raise funds through the issuance of Sukuk. This could be a government, a corporation, a financial institution, or another legal entity with financing needs. CAIHTE\n\nb) Issuer/Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) \u2014 a separate legal entity established to issue the Sukuk. It holds the underlying assets or business activities related to the Sukuk and serves as the conduit through which investors can participate in the ownership of the underlying assets.\n\nc) Shariah Advisor \u2014 Also known as Shariah board is a panel of Islamic scholars or experts in Islamic finance who ensure that the Sukuk structure and the underlying assets comply with Shariah principles. They provide guidance on the structuring of the Sukuk to ensure compliance with Islamic law.\n\nd) Lead Manager/Arranger \u2014 typically a financial institution or investment bank responsible for structuring the Sukuk issuance, coordinating the transaction, and underwriting the issuance. This party plays a key role in the origination and execution of the Sukuk issuance.\n\ne) Trustee \u2014 a fiduciary appointed to represent the interests of the Sukuk holders. The trustee ensures that the rights of the Sukuk holders are protected and that the issuer complies with the terms and conditions of the Sukuk.\n\nf) Investors \u2014 individuals, institutions, or entities that purchase the Sukuk certificates, providing the funds needed by the issuer.\n\ng) Underwriters \u2014 financial institutions or investment banks that commit to purchase any unsold portion of the Sukuk issuance, thereby providing assurance to the issuer that the entire issuance will be subscribed.\n\nOn the other hand, underwriters may not always commit to purchasing the unsold portion of the issuance. Instead, the issuer and the lead arranger may structure the offering in a way that places the responsibility of selling the entire issuance on the issuer. In such cases, the underwriter's role may be limited to facilitating the issuance, providing advisory services, and ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements and market standards.\n\nh) Obligor \u2014 the entity responsible for making the payments due on the Sukuk to the investors. This entity may be the originator's operating company, business, or the underlying assets themselves.\n\nThe specific parties involved and their roles may vary depending on the type and structure of the Sukuk issuance. aScITE\n\nWhile these functions are typically performed by separate entities, it is theoretically possible for one entity or individual to take on multiple roles in a Sukuk transaction. For example, a corporation could act as the originator, establish the SPV, and also act as the lead manager for the Sukuk issuance. However, this may raise potential conflicts of interest and is less common in practice due to the need for independence and expertise in each role.\n\nNote: In Sukuk structures, the obligor, originator, and issuer can be the same entity, but they can also be different entities. The specific roles and relationships among these parties depend on the structure and terms of the Sukuk issuance. Here are the typical scenarios:\n\nSame Entity:\n\n\u2022 In many Sukuk structures, the obligor (the entity responsible for making payments to Sukuk holders), the originator (the entity that originates the underlying assets or business activities), and the issuer (the entity that issues the Sukuk) are the same. This is a straightforward structure where a single entity assumes all these roles.\n\nDifferent Entities:\n\n\u2022 In some Sukuk structures, the roles are separated, and different entities perform each function:\n\no Issuer: The entity that formally issues the Sukuk and represents the Sukuk holders.\n\no Obligor: The entity that undertakes the responsibility for making payments to Sukuk holders.\n\no Originator: The entity that originates the underlying assets or business activities that the Sukuk are linked to.\n\n\u2022 The separation of these roles can be part of the structuring of Sukuk transactions to achieve specific objectives. For example, having a separate obligor from the originator or issuer might be a risk management strategy, enhancing the creditworthiness of the Sukuk by involving a party with a stronger financial position.\n\nThe flexibility in Sukuk structures allows for customization to meet the specific needs and preferences of the parties involved. It is important for investors and stakeholders to carefully review the documents and legal agreements associated with a Sukuk issuance to understand the roles and relationships among the obligor, originator, and issuer in that particular structure. DETACa\n\n3. Sukuk are based on one or more of 14 named Islamic contracts, though a smaller number are used in practice. They usually involve the use of a SPV which holds the assets on behalf of the investors and which is the formal issuer of the Sukuk. Sukuk structures are not standardized and the principal named contract is usually accompanied by a number of other contracts and undertakings.\n\nHere are some commonly recognized Islamic contracts that may be employed in Sukuk structures and other Islamic financial transactions. These contracts provide the legal and Shariah framework for the issuance and trading of Sukuk.\n\n1) Murabahah: Cost-plus financing.\n\n2) Al-Ijarah: Leasing or rental contract.\n\n3) Musharakah: Joint venture or partnership.\n\n4) Mudarabah: Profit and loss sharing partnership.\n\n5) Wakalah: Agency contract.\n\n6) Istisna-a: Pre-delivery sale or manufacturing contract.\n\n7) Salam: Forward sale with advance payment.\n\n8) Kafalah: Guarantee or suretyship.\n\n9) Hawala: Transfer or remittance contract.\n\n10) Musawamah: Bargaining or general sales contract.\n\n11) Muzara'ah: Sharecropping or agricultural partnership.\n\n12) Mudarabah Mutlaqah: Unrestricted Mudarabah.\n\n13) Wadi'ah: Safekeeping or custody contract.\n\n14) Sukuk: Islamic bonds.\n\n4. All Banks, including Islamic Banks (IBs)/Islamic Banking Unit (IBUs) of Conventional Banks and Non-Bank Financial Intermediaries (NBFIs) shall classify and subsequently measure a Sukuk investment either at amortized cost, fair value through other comprehensive income, or fair value through profit or loss based on its business model for managing the investment; and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the Sukuk in accordance with Philippine Financial Reporting Standards (PFRS) 9, the following shall be followed:\n\na. Classification and Measurement: Determine the appropriate classification and measurement category for the Sukuk based on its contractual cash flow characteristics. PFRS 9 provides three categories: amortized cost, fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI), and fair value through profit or loss (FVPL).\n\nb. Initial Recognition: Upon issuance of the Sukuk, recognize it initially at fair value, which is typically the transaction price. If there are any transaction costs directly attributable to the issuance, they are generally deducted from the initial carrying amount. HEITAD\n\nc. Subsequent Measurement: Measure the Sukuk instrument based on its classification:\n\n\u2022 For instruments classified at amortized cost, measure them at amortized cost using the effective profit method (effective interest rate method).\n\n\u2022 For instruments classified as FVOCI, measure them at fair value, with changes recognized in other comprehensive income.\n\n\u2022 For instruments classified as FVTPL, measure them at fair value, with changes recognized in profit or loss.\n\nd. Impairment: Assess the Sukuk instrument for impairment based on the expected credit losses. Recognize a loss allowance for the expected credit losses if there is a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition.\n\ne. Derecognition: Derecognize the Sukuk when it is redeemed, repurchased, or matures, or when the contractual rights to cash flows expire. The gain or loss on derecognition is generally recognized in profit or loss.\n\nf. Disclosures: Present the Sukuk instrument on the balance sheet in accordance with its classification. Additionally, ensure that the financial statements provide the required disclosures, including information about the nature, terms and extent of risks arising from financial instruments, as well as the accounting policies applied.\n\nTaxability\n\nSukuk issued, structured in a Shari'ah-compliant manner, but with economic characteristics similar to bonds, are subject to the following taxes:\n\n1. Determination of Gain: The gain or profit in Sukuk is determined based on the specific structure and terms of the Sukuk issuance. It can be calculated through profit-sharing ratios, rental income, mark-up or price differentials, or the sale of underlying assets. The method of determining gain or profit depends on the contractual arrangements outlined in the Sukuk documentation. aDSIHc\n\n1.1 Gains or profits realized by Sukuk holders from Sukuk transactions with maturity of less than five years are subject to 20% final withholding tax (FWT). On the other hand, those with maturity of five years or more are excluded from the gross income and are therefore exempt from income tax. [1]\n\n1.2 In the case of Sukuk pre-termination, entire gains or profits realized by Sukuk holders, are subject to FWT [2] with varying rates based on the remaining maturity thereof:\n\nFour (4) years to less than five (5) years \u2014 5%;\n\nThree (3) years to less than (4) years \u2014 12%; and\n\nLess than three (3) years \u2014 20%.\n\n1.3 Gains or profits realized by Sukuk holders, from Sukuk transactions, who are non-resident aliens not engaged in trade or business in the Philippines and non-resident foreign corporation are subject to twenty five percent (25%) [3] FWT;\n\n2. The Sukuk issuer is required to withhold the tax at every payment of gains or profits and for purchases of asset either directly from a supplier or through an agent;\n\n3. Gains or profits realized by Originator/Obligor, Arranger, Manager, and Underwriter from Sukuk transactions are subject to regular income tax and value-added tax (VAT) or percentage tax, whichever is applicable;\n\n4. Gains or profits realized by the SPV are subject to regular income tax but exempt from VAT;\n\n5. Any disposal or lease of the underlying asset, and execution of any additional instrument required in a Sukuk transaction, for the purpose of compliance with Shari'ah principles but which will not be required in a conventional bond transaction, shall be deemed excluded for taxation purposes;\n\n6. A documentary stamp tax (DST) is imposed on all Sukuk instruments under Sections 176 and 179 of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended, (Tax Code) unless excepted under Section 199 (g) of the same code.\n\nSukuk Structures\n\nAs already indicated, variations on these structures are possible even when the Sukuk is given the same name. In particular, while the obligor, accepting responsibility for the payments under the Sukuk and for buying back the assets at the end of the term, is normally the same as the originator, in some cases there is a separate obligor. ATICcS\n\nThe following sub-paragraphs give examples of some Sukuk structures that may be encountered in practice.\n\n1. Sukuk al-murabahah\n\n1.1 Murabahah is basically the sale of goods at a price comprising the purchase price plus a margin of profit agreed upon by both parties concerned. In practice, its use in Sukuk is normally in the form of commodity murabahah (sometimes called tawarruq) in which a commodity is bought and then immediately re-sold, with one of the transactions being on deferred payment terms. The principle of Murabahah, which is the cost-plus-profit arrangement. In this Sukuk, the issuer raises funds by selling certificates representing ownership in tangible assets acquired through a Murabahah transaction. The underlying transaction involves the purchase of goods at a disclosed cost, and the goods are then sold to the Sukuk issuer at a markup. The Sukuk holders, in turn, receive periodic returns based on the agreed-upon profit margin. The structure is commonly used for short-to-medium-term financing needs in various sectors, allowing both issuers and investors to engage in transactions that align with Islamic finance principles.\n\n1.2 Figure 1: Transaction structure diagram of Sukuk al-murabahah\n\n1.3 Tax Neutrality\n\nTransactions\n\nTax Consequence\n\n1.

In the case of certificate pre-termination \u2014 subject to FWT with varying rates.\n\n2. Sukuk al-ijara\n\n2.1 Sukuk al-ijara involves the transfer of ownership or benefit/usufruct of tangible assets from an originator to an SPV, which then issues to investors Sukuk certificates representing undivided ownership interests in such assets. The asset is then leased back to the originator by the SPV for a specified term, which is typically commensurate with the term of the certificates. Each Sukuk holder is entitled to receive the rentals generated under the lease pro rata to its ownership interest in the underlying asset. The amount of these rentals is equal to, and used by the SPV to pay, the periodic distribution amount payable under the Sukuk at that time. Sukuk-al-ijara is an asset-based Sukuk which is economically similar to a conventional bond.

At maturity, the Originator buys the asset back and pays the asset price to SPV\n\nNo tax consequence.\n\n8.   Redemption of Sukuk\n\nNo tax consequence.\n\n3. Sukuk al-musharakah\n\n3.1 Musharakah means a relationship established under a contract by the mutual consent of the parties for sharing of profits and losses in the joint business venture. All providers of capital are entitled to participate in management, but is not necessarily required to do so. The profit is distributed among the partners in pre-agreed ratios, while the loss is borne by every partner strictly in proportion to respective capital contributions. cSEDTC\n\n3.2 A variant on this basic structure is the use of Sukuk-al-musharakah in issuances by Islamic banks which are intended to rank as regulatory capital. In these cases, the Sukuk are generally perpetual and convertible to equity under certain adverse trigger events.\n\n3.3 Figure 3: Transaction structure diagram of sukuk al-musharakah\n\n3.4 Tax Neutrality\n\nTransactions\n\nTax Consequence\n\n1.

Sukuk al-mudarabah\n\n4.1 Mudarabah means an agreement between two parties according to which one of the two parties provides the capital (capital provider) and for the other (mudarib) to work with on the condition that the profit is to be shared between them according to a pre-agreed ratio. Losses, if any, are borne by capital providers only. AIDSTE\n\n4.2 Like their musharakah counterparts, Sukuk-al-mudarabah may be used by Islamic banks to raise regulatory capital and, in these cases, the Sukuk are usually perpetual and subject to conversion provisions.\n\n4.3 Figure 4.

In the case of certificate pre-termination \u2014 subject to FWT with varying rates.\n\n5. Sukuk al-wakalah\n\n5.1 Sukuk al-wakalah are based on an agency contract. Normally this is used in its investment agency variant (wakalah bi al-istithmar) wherein the agent invests the fund into a pool of eligible investments or assets. Commonly, the pool of investment is originally held by the obligor. The obligor in its capacity as an agent will manage the investment based on the agreement between the principal (investors, via SPV) and the agent, which among others governs the expected return (profit) and fees (usually performance based). A sale/purchase undertaking agreement governs the purchase undertaking by the obligor upon maturity and the relevant exercise price. SDAaTC\n\n5.2 Sukuk al-wakalah is a further Sukuk structure sometimes used for bank regulatory capital, normally in perpetual form and with convertibility provisions.\n\n5.3 Figure 5: Transaction structure diagram of sukuk al-wakalah\n\n5.4 Tax Neutrality\n\nTransactions\n\nTax Consequence\n\n1.

Sukuk al-istisna'a\n\n6.1 Istisna'a refers to the sale of a specified asset, with an obligation on the part of the seller to manufacture/construct it using his own materials and to deliver it on a specific date in return for a specific price to be paid in one lump sum or installments. The price can be paid in a lump sum or in installments, as agreed between the parties. Istisna'a can be used for financing the manufacture or construction of houses, plants, projects, and building of bridges, roads and highways. AaCTcI\n\n6.2 The issuer of the Sukuk is in principle the manufacturer (supplier/seller), the originator is the buyer, while the funds realized from subscription are the cost of manufacturing/constructing the product. However, an SPV is not a suitable entity to undertake a substantial manufacturing/construction project and the suitability of Sukuk al-istisna'a for financing purposes is based on the permissibility for the contractor in istisna'a to enter into a parallel istisna'a contract with a subcontractor. Thus, the SPV may undertake the construction of a facility for a deferred price, and subcontract the actual construction to a specialized firm.\n\n6.3 The istisna'a contract is often combined with an advance lease contract (ijara). This allows payments during the construction phase which are available for distribution to the Sukuk holders. The diagram below incorporates this feature. acEHCD\n\n6.4 Figure 6: Transaction structure diagram of Sukuk al-Istisna'a\n\n6.5 Tax Neutrality\n\nTransactions\n\nTax Consequence\n\n1.

EcTCAD\n\n7.2 The issuer of the certificates (the SPV) is the buyer of the goods of salam, while the originator is the seller. The SPV (possibly through the originator as agent) will normally enter into a parallel salam contract to sell the goods once they are received.\n\n7.3 For a number of reasons, salam-based Sukuk are usually short-term instrument; 90 days would be a typical period.\n\n7.4 Figure 7: Transaction structure diagram of Sukuk al-salam\n\n7.5 Tax Neutrality\n\nTransactions\n\nTax Consequence\n\n1.

In the case of certificate pre-termination \u2014 subject to FWT with varying rates.\n\nIn conclusion, Sukuk represent an important and growing segment of the global financial markets, providing Shariah-compliant investment opportunities and alternative financing options. Understanding the taxability of Sukuk is essential for both issuers and investors, as it involves considerations such as documentary stamp tax, withholding tax, and the tax treatment of income and gains. Given the evolving nature of tax laws and regulations, it's crucial for stakeholders to stay informed about the specific tax implications associated with Sukuk transactions.

One of the key reforms introduced by the EOPT Act is the change in the use of Sales Invoices and Official Receipts for tax purposes. Sections 113 and 237 of the said Act provide: HTcADC\n\n\"Sec. 113. Invoicing and Accounting Requirements for Value-Added Tax (VAT) Registered Persons. \u2014\n\n(A) Invoicing Requirement. \u2014 A VAT-registered person shall issue a VAT Invoice for every sale, barter, exchange, or lease of goods or properties and for every sale, barter or exchange of services. x x x.\"\n\n\"Sec. 237. Issuance of Sales or Commercial Invoices. \u2014\n\n(A) Issuance. \u2014 All persons subject to an internal revenue tax shall, at the point of each sale and transfer of merchandise or for services rendered valued at five hundred pesos (PhP500.00) or more, issue duly registered sale or commercial Invoices, showing the name, Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN), date of transaction, quantity, unit cost and description of merchandise or nature of service: x x x.\"\n\nBased on the foregoing provisions, an \"Invoice\" is now required to be issued for both sales of goods and services. In view of this, this Circular is being issued to clarify the invoicing requirements under the EOPT Act, the use and printing of Sales Invoice and to provide a sample format of Invoices to be used as reference by taxpayers and concerned BIR personnel.\n\nQ1: What is the invoicing requirement for a VAT-registered person?\n\nA1: A VAT-registered person shall issue a duly registered VAT Invoice for every sale, barter, exchange or lease of goods or properties, and for every sale, barter or exchange of services regardless of the amount of the transaction.\n\nQ2: What is the invoicing requirement for a Non-VAT registered person?\n\nA2: A Non-VAT-registered person shall issue a duly registered Non-VAT Invoice for every sale, barter, exchange or lease of goods or properties, and for every sale, barter or exchange of services valued at Five Hundred Pesos (Php500.00) or more. However, if a buyer requests for an Invoice, the seller must issue the same regardless of the amount of transaction. CAIHTE\n\nQ3: Does a seller need to issue an Invoice if the sale amount of a single transaction is less than P500.00?\n\nA3: The following rules shall be observed:\n\na. For VAT-registered sellers, the issuance of VAT Invoice for each sale transaction is required, regardless of the amount of transaction.\n\nb. For Non-VAT registered sellers, an invoice shall be issued in the following cases:\n\ni. the amount of a single sale transaction is more than P500.00;\n\nii. the buyer requested/demanded an invoice, regardless of the amount of sales transaction;\n\niii. If at the end of the day, the aggregate amount of all sales transactions amounting to less than P500.00 exceeded the P500.00 threshold.\n\nQ4: When will the P500.00 threshold for issuing an Invoice be adjusted?\n\nA4: The P500.00 amount shall be adjusted to its present value every three (3) years, beginning January 22, 2024 or the effectivity of the EOPT Act, using the Consumer Price Index, as published by the Philippine Statistics Authority.\n\nQ5: The seller is engaged in sale of service. After the effectivity of the EOPT Act, does the seller need to apply for a new Authority to Print (ATP) Invoice and issue an Invoice?\n\nA5: YES, since the Invoice is now the primary evidence for recording sales of goods and services. For this purpose, an ATP must be secured before a seller can have an Accredited Printer print an Invoice. However, during the transitory period, sellers may opt to use their remaining unused Official Receipts by converting them into Invoice following the options in Question No. 10 and Question No. 21 hereof.\n\nQ6: What information must be contained in a VAT Invoice and Non-VAT Invoice?\n\nA6: The Invoice shall contain the information provided under Section 6(B) of Revenue Regulations No. 7-2024. aScITE\n\nQ7: Is it necessary to indicate the business style in the Invoice?\n\nA7: No. Business Style of the buyer or seller is not required to be indicated in the Invoice. However, the seller may indicate its business name in the Invoice for trade name or store name identification or branding purposes.\n\nQ8: While the EOPT Act eliminates the Official Receipts as evidence of sales of goods and services for tax purposes, can sellers still validly use and issue their remaining unused booklets of Official Receipts?\n\nA8: Upon effectivity of RR No. 7-2024, Official Receipt is treated as a supplementary document. Taxpayers, however have the following options on the remaining unused Official Receipts:\n\nOption 1: Continue the use of remaining Official Receipts as supplementary document;\n\nor\n\nOption 2: Convert and use the remaining Official Receipts as Invoice following the requirements in Question No. 10 and Question No. 21 hereof.\n\nQ9: If the seller wants to use his/her/its remaining unused booklets of Official Receipts as supplementary documents, are there any requirements?\n\nA9: All unused or unissued Official Receipts may still be used as supplementary document until they are fully consumed, provided that each page of the unused Official Receipt must be stamped with the phrase \"THIS DOCUMENT IS NOT VALID FOR CLAIM OF INPUT TAX.\" Failure to do so will not make the document a valid replacement for the Invoice; hence, seller may be considered as not issuing an Invoice and may be subject to applicable penalty.\n\nQ10: If the seller wants to convert and use his/her/its remaining unused booklets of Official Receipts as Invoice or Billing Statement/Statement of Account/Statement of Charges into Billing Invoice, are there any requirements?\n\nA10: Taxpayers may convert the remaining unused booklets of old Official Receipts and use the same as Invoice, or the Billing Statement/Statement of Account/Statement of Charges into Billing Invoice, until they are fully consumed, provided that, the word \"Official Receipt/Billing Statement/Statement of Account/Statement of Charges into Billing Invoice\" on the face of the manual and loose leaf printed receipt shall be stricken out [e.g., Official Receipt] and shall be stamped \"Invoice\" or \"Cash Invoice\" or \"Charge Invoice\" or \"Credit Invoice\" or \"Service Invoice\" or [e.g., Billing Statement] \"Billing Invoice,\" or any name describing the transaction for which such Invoice shall be issued to its buyer/purchaser.\n\nSince the Official Receipt/Billing Statement/Statement of Account/Statement of Charges will serve as supplementary document, the conversion of such to Invoice/Billing Invoice as primary invoice is an option given to taxpayers, provided that the converted Invoice/Billing Invoice shall contain the required information provided under RR No. 7-2024, as amended, including details like quantity, unit cost and description or nature of service pursuant to Sec. 237 of the Tax Code. Missing information may be stamped on the document if not originally included, upon conversion.

The missing information may be stamped on the document if not originally included, upon conversion.\n\nQ12: Can the seller use a Cash Invoice, Charge Invoice, Credit Invoice, Service Invoice or Billing Invoice and apply for its Authority to Print?\n\nA12: Yes. Taxpayers may use any descriptive name for its Invoice to describe the nature of the transaction/s with the buyer/purchaser, such as \"Invoice,\" \"Sales Invoice,\" \"Cash Invoice,\" \"Charge Invoice,\" \"Credit Invoice,\" \"Billing Invoice,\" \"Service Invoice\"; Provided, that in all such cases, the word \"Invoice\" is prominently printed. HEITAD\n\ne.g.,\n\nQ13: When does the seller use Invoice, Cash Invoice, Credit Invoice, Billing Invoice or Service Invoice?\n\nA13: Sales transactions are typically either cash (paid) or on credit (not yet paid) and an Invoice should be issued in both cases. Taxpayer may label or name its Invoice to reflect its specific sales transactions. To clearly identify the type of sale, the seller may use different descriptive names for the Invoice to reflect the nature of transactions, such as:\n\n\u2022 Invoice \u2014 Issued for both sales of goods or services rendered\n\n\u2022 Sales Invoice \u2014 General purpose Invoice for any sales transaction\n\n\u2022 Cash Invoice \u2014 Used for cash sales or specifically for sales where immediate payment is received\n\n\u2022 Charge/Credit Invoice \u2014 Issued for sales on credit, where payment is expected at a later date\n\n\u2022 Service Invoice \u2014 Used for transactions where a service is provided\n\n\u2022 Billing Invoice \u2014 A document to bill charges similar to Charge Invoice and contains other information similar to a statement of account, billing statement, summarizing charges for a specific transaction\n\n\u2022 Commercial Invoice \u2014 A document used by exporter for export transactions\n\n\u2022 Miscellaneous Invoice \u2014 Issued for other income received by the seller\n\nStarting April 27, 2024, sellers of goods and services shall issue any of the above invoices for their transactions. aDSIHc\n\nQ14: In the case of utility companies and other recurring service providers in which a customer is being billed, when should an Invoice be issued for the services rendered?\n\nA14: Service providers who billed their customers shall now issue a Billing Invoice upon billing instead of Billing Statement or Statement of Account. The Billing Invoice should contain the required information provided under RR No. 7-2024, as amended, including the quantity, unit cost and description or nature of service pursuant to Sec. 237 of the Tax Code.\n\nQ15: The seller is engaged in the sales of goods or services, can he/she/it issue Invoice at the time of sale and another Invoice to acknowledge receipt of payment?\n\nA15: No. Sellers cannot issue an invoice upon receipt of payment. However, an Official Receipt or Payment Receipt or Acknowledgement Receipt may be issued upon subsequent collection or receipt of payment.\n\nIllustration:\n\nIncorrect:\n\nAction\n\nInvoice Series\n\nDate of Transaction\n\nRemarks\n\nSale of Goods/Services\n\n#00001\n\n27-April-2024\n\nInvoice issued for sale, but no payment received yet.\n\nReceipt of Payment/Collection of Receivable\n\n#00002\n\n05-May-2024\n\n(This is incorrect.)

ATICcS\n\nSample Invoice:\n\nQ17: Can the seller use two types or two sets of Invoice? E.g., Cash Invoice and Charge Invoice or Sales Invoice and Service Invoice?\n\nA17: Taxpayers have the option which Invoice/s may be used depending upon the transactions that will be issued such Invoice/s.\n\nE.g., a.

Documentary requirements for tax credit/refund claims pursuant to Section 204, in relation to Section 229 of the Tax Code, vary depending on the nature of the tax sought to be refunded/credited and the circumstances that led to the taxes alleged to have been erroneously or illegally received or collected or penalties imposed without authority.

Accordingly, the claims shall be processed based on the documents submitted.

Payment of Documentary Stamp Tax. \u2014\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(B) Time for Filing and Payment of the Tax. \u2014 Except as provided by rules and regulations promulgated by the Secretary of Finance, upon recommendation of the Commissioner, the tax return prescribed in this Section shall be filed, either electronically or manually, [2] within ten (10) days after the close of the month when the taxable document was made, signed, issued, accepted, or transferred, and the tax thereon shall be paid at the same time the aforesaid return is filed.\" (Underscoring supplied)\n\nBased on the above provision, the Secretary of Finance, upon recommendation of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, may prescribe the deadline for filing of DST returns and payment of DST. Pursuant to this authority, the Secretary of Finance issued Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 6-2001 which prescribes that the DST return shall be filed within FIVE (5) DAYS after the close of the month when the taxable document was made, signed, accepted, or transferred, and the tax thereon shall be paid at the same time the DST return is filed.\n\nSince the EOPT Law did not introduce any amendment to the deadline for filing of DST return and payment of DST, the current rule under RR No. 6-2001 applies. Hence, the DST return shall be filed within FIVE (5) DAYS after the close of the month when the taxable document was made, signed, accepted, or transferred, and the tax thereon shall be paid at the same time the DST return is filed.\n\nAll revenue officials concerned are enjoined to give this Circular as wide a publicity as possible.\n\nThis Circular shall take effect immediately.

                                    "Details": "This Circular is issued to clarify issues and set guidelines for the effective implementation of Section 110 (D) of the Tax Code, as introduced in Republic Act (RA) No. 11976, also known as \"Ease of Paying Taxes Act,\" which provides that:\n\n\"Output VAT Credit on Uncollected Receivables. \u2014 A seller of goods or services may deduct the output VAT pertaining to uncollected receivables from its output VAT on the next quarter, after the lapse of the agreed upon period to pay: Provided, That the seller has fully paid the VAT on the transaction: Provided, further, That the VAT component of the uncollected receivables has not been claimed as allowable deduction under Section 34(E) of this Code. CAIHTE\n\nIn case of recovery of uncollected receivables, the output VAT pertaining thereto shall be added to the output VAT of the taxpayer during the period of recovery.\"\n\nQ1: What is the rationale of Section 110 (D) above?\n\nA1: Sales are either made in cash or on account.\n\nIn Cash sales, the seller, who has passed-on the VAT to the buyer has no problem in the corresponding VAT due thereon to the Bureau since the seller has already collected the agreed selling price, including the corresponding VAT.\n\nIn credit sales, the seller, without having received the payment therefor, agreed to part the goods or properties, or lease the properties, or to render service, upon sale, barter or exchange, secured only by a written agreement that the buyer thereof promises to pay the money owed including the VAT at a certain period (credit term). The seller, being the person statutorily liable for the payment of the VAT, pays in advance the VAT passed-on to the buyer to the Bureau. In some cases, the receivables are not collected. Under these circumstances, the seller would ordinarily recognize the uncollected receivable including the VAT as a bad debt and claim the same as a deduction from gross income following the provisions set forth under Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 5-99, as amended by RR No. 25-2002.\n\nFounded on the interests of justice, the provision therefore provides an avenue by which a VAT-registered seller of goods or services can recoup the VAT paid in advance which was passed-on to the buyer and made part of the consideration resulting from the sale, barter or exchange on account or on credit, where such trade receivable has not been collected after the agreed period with the buyer. This rule covers credit of VAT shouldered and paid for by the seller. aScITE\n\nQ2: What is the meaning of the phrase \"after the lapse of the agreed upon period to pay\"?\n\nA2: For purposes of this Circular, the phrase \"after the lapse of the agreed upon period to pay\" means that the buyer, to whom goods or properties were sold, bartered or exchanged or to whom a property has been leased, or to whom service has been rendered upon written promise to pay the money owed and the passed on VAT at a certain period and where such period or extended date, as the case may be, has lapsed without the buyer having fulfilled the promise.\n\nQ3: Who can claim or deduct output VAT credit on uncollected receivables?\n\nA3: Only the seller of goods and/or services may deduct the output VAT which corresponds to the uncollected receivables originating from the sales on account that transpired upon the effectivity of RR No. 3-2024 from the output VAT of the next quarter after the lapse of the agreed upon period to pay.\n\nQ4: What are the conditions before a seller can credit the VAT paid on the uncollected receivables?\n\nA4: To be entitled to VAT credit, the following requisites must be present:\n\n1. The sale or exchange has taken place after the effectivity of RR No. 3-2024;\n\n2. The sale is on credit or on account;\n\n3. There is a written agreement on the period to pay the receivable, i.e., credit term is indicated on the invoice or any document showing the credit term;\n\n4. The VAT is separately shown on the invoice;\n\n5. The sale is specifically reported in the Summary List of Sales covering the period when the sale was made and not reported as part of \"various\" sales;\n\n6. The seller declared in the BIR Form No. 2550Q or the quarterly VAT Return (QVR) the corresponding output VAT indicated in the invoice within the period prescribed under existing rules;\n\n7. The period agreed upon, whether extended or not, has lapsed; and\n\n8. The VAT component of the uncollected receivable was not claimed as a deduction from gross income (i.e., bad debt) pursuant to Section 34 (E) of the Tax Code. DETACa\n\nQ5: Do the preceding rules have an effect to the deductibility of bad debts expense for purposes of income tax?\n\nA5: No. These rules do not amend the conditions on the deductibility of bad debts expense in the income tax returns as provided in RR No. 25-2002. For purposes of claiming output VAT credit on uncollected receivables, mere lapse of the agreed upon period to pay even without any effort on the part of the seller to collect the sales on account shall entitle the seller of output VAT credit subject to the conditions under Q&A No. 4 above.\n\nQ6 Is the seller required to automatically credit the VAT paid every time there is an uncollected receivable due to the lapse of the agreed upon period?\n\nA6: No. Availing of the benefit under Section 110 (D) of the Tax Code is merely an option. The seller may not necessarily automatically claim the output VAT credit on the uncollected receivable especially so if the likelihood of collectability is high. This will save the hassle on the part of the seller to claim the said VAT credit, only to reverse the same in the eventual collection of the receivable.\n\nQ7: When can the seller claim output VAT credit on uncollected receivables?\n\nA7: Section 110 (D) mandates that the claim for output VAT credit on uncollected receivables shall be on the next quarter, after the lapse of the agreed upon period to pay.\n\nIllustration:\n\nABC Corp. supplies merchandise to its clients on account payable within 90 days.

In this scenario, the corresponding output VAT for the sales covering April to June 2024 were declared in the QVR ending June 30, 2024 and the current quarter where the failure to collect the receivable happened in September 30, 2024. ABC Corp. may claim as output VAT credit in the quarter ending December 31, 2024 which is the next QVR after the lapse of the agreed period to pay during the quarter ending September 30, 2024 the VAT component of the uncollected receivables pertaining to the sales on account on June 30, 2024 as it fell due on September 28, 2024 and remained uncollected as of December 31, 2024.\n\nb. Since the sales on account on June 30, 2024 remained uncollected as of March 31, 2025, can ABC Corp. deduct again its VAT component in the QVR for the quarter ending March 31, 2025? HEITAD\n\nNo. The 90-day period, counting from June 30, 2024 lapsed on September 28, 2024. The VAT component of the uncollected receivables for the month of June 2024 can only be claimed ONCE as deduction from output VAT of the next quarter after the lapse of the agreed period to pay (in this case quarter ending December 31, 2024).\n\nc. Following the preceding question, if the seller failed to claim the corresponding VAT credit on the QVR ending December 31, 2024, can the seller claim the VAT credit on the QVR ending March 31, 2025 if it remained uncollected?\n\nYes. Provided, the seller and the buyer agreed for an extended period to pay until December 31, 2024. The seller may claim the output VAT credit on the uncollected receivable on the QVR ending March 31, 2025 if it remained uncollected on March 31, 2025. Note that Section 110 (D) of the Tax Code limits the claim for deduction \"from the output VAT on the next quarter\" only, after the lapse of the agreed period to pay.\n\nQ8: What happens if there is subsequent recovery of uncollected receivables where the output VAT was already claimed as VAT credit?\n\nA8: The corresponding output VAT of the subsequently collected or recovered receivables previously claimed as VAT credit shall be reported and declared in the taxable quarter in which the recovery or collection is made. In case of failure to declare, the penalties under existing rules and regulations shall apply.\n\nIllustration:\n\nABC Corp. supplies merchandise to its clients on account payable within 90 days.

ABC Corp. shall declare the recovered output VAT in the QVR for the quarter ending March 31, 2025.\n\nQ9: What is the effect on the input tax claimed by the delinquent buyer when the seller availed of the output VAT credit on uncollected receivable? aDSIHc\n\nA9: The corresponding input tax claimed by the buyer shall not be allowed as input VAT credit the moment the seller claims output VAT credit on such uncollected receivable.\n\nQ10: How will the seller document the particular sales on account where the corresponding output VAT credit was claimed for being uncollected receivable?\n\nA10: The seller shall stamp \"Claimed Output VAT Credit\" on the duplicate/triplicate copy/ies (seller's copy) of the corresponding invoice issued for the uncollected receivable. In case there is a partial payment on the said uncollected receivable, the amount collected therefrom and the balance of the uncollected receivable shall also be indicated.\n\nThe seller is not precluded from issuing supplementary sales document such as credit memo or credit note on top of the stamping of \"Claimed Output VAT Credit\" on the invoice to serve as proof thereto and/or as a basis in recording the same in the books of accounts of the seller.

However, if the seller lumps all sales into one \"various\" account entry, the lumping shall be considered invalid compliance with the requisites provided for purposes of claiming the output VAT credit on uncollected receivables and the output VAT cannot be used or allowed as VAT Credit should the transaction remain uncollected after the lapse of the agreed period to pay.\n\nQ15: Who are not qualified to avail the tax credit on VAT paid on uncollected receivables?\n\nA15: The following taxpayers are disqualified to avail output VAT tax credit on uncollected receivables:\n\n1.

ETHIDa\n\nQ19: Is the seller required to issue an invoice upon the recovery of previously uncollected receivable?\n\nA19: No. The seller shall stamp the phrase \"Recovered\" in the Invoice that is the origin of the transaction that was previously declared as uncollected and the amount collected, if partial, on the same duplicate/triplicate copy/ies (seller's copy) of the corresponding invoice issued for the uncollected receivable.\n\nThe seller is not precluded from issuing supplementary sales document such as debit memo or debit note to serve as proof thereto. In this instance, the seller shall indicate in the supplementary sales document the phrase \"Recovery of Previously Reported Uncollected Receivable\" and must indicate the Invoice that is the origin of the transaction that was previously declared as uncollected. Consequently, the seller shall provide a copy of the said documents to the buyer.\n\nQ20: How should the output VAT of recovered or subsequently collected receivables be presented/declared in the VAT Return?\n\nA20: As a work-around procedure or until such time that a new version of the BIR Form No. 2550Q has been issued for this purpose, the seller and the buyer shall reflect the corresponding output VAT as follows:\n\nFiler\n\nVersion Used\n\nSeller\n\nBuyer\n\nEFPS\n\nFebruary 2007 (ENCS)\n\nLine 23E \"Others\"\n\nLine 20E \"Others\"\n\neBIR Forms and Manual Filers\n\nJanuary 2023 (ENCS)\n\nLine 53 \"Others\" and indicate \"Output VAT on Recovered Previously Claimed Uncollected Receivable\"\n\nLine 40 \"Others\" and indicate \"Input VAT on Paid Purchases on Account Previously Unsettled\"\n\nQ21: Will the outstanding receivables on sale of goods where the corresponding output VAT has been declared but the period to collect has already lapsed as of the effectivity of RR No. 3-2024 qualify for output VAT credit under Section 110 (D) of the Tax Code?\n\nA21: No. The output VAT credit on uncollected receivables shall only apply to sales of goods and/or services on account that transpired upon the effectivity of RR No. 3-2024.

The amendment is implemented through Section 6 of Revenue Regulations No. 4-2024. HTcADC\n\nQuoted hereunder is the provision of Section 34 (K) of the Tax Code, as amended:\n\n\"Section 34 (K). Additional Requirements for Deductibility of Certain Payments. \u2014 Any amount paid or payable which is otherwise deductible from, or taken into account in computing gross income or for which depreciation or amortization may be allowed under this Section, shall be allowed as a deduction only if it is shown that the tax required to be deducted and withheld therefrom has been has been paid to the Bureau of Internal Revenue in accordance with this Section, Sections 58 and 81 of this Code.\"\n\nWith the repeal of the above-quoted provision under the EOPT Act, a particular income payment where a tax is required to be withheld can now be allowed as deduction from the gross income, even if no tax was withheld, provided the same is necessary, ordinary and duly substantiated expense related to the registered business of the taxpayer.\n\nSince the EOPT Act took effect on January 22, 2024, a question arose if the repeal of the said provision may be applied to all assessed cases and on-going audits covering taxable periods prior to the effectivity of EOPT Act.\n\nIn this regard, all concerned are hereby advised of the following policies and clarifications:\n\n1. On all ongoing audit covering taxable period prior to January 1, 2024 \u2014 expenses subject to withholding tax shall be allowed as deductions from gross income by the Revenue Officers (RO) only if the corresponding tax required to be withheld have been paid, whether prior to audit or submission of the audit report to the Reviewing Office.\n\n2. In a scenario where taxpayer failed to withhold the tax required to be withheld on expenses subject to withholding tax and the taxpayer did not pay the same prior to submission of the audit report to the reviewing office, the RO has to recommend for the issuance of assessment notice both on income and withholding tax. This is in line with the provisions of Revenue Regulations No. 6-2018. CAIHTE\n\n3. On audit cases which are already submitted to the Reviewing Office\n\na. Paid Case \u2014 same application stated under item 1 hereof;\n\nb. Assessed Case \u2014 apply the requirement of deductibility under the then Section 34 (K) of the Tax Code, thus, assessment on both income tax and withholding tax shall be issued.\n\nFor taxable year covering January 1, 2024 onwards, expenses/income payments subject to withholding tax shall be allowed as deductions from gross income for purposes of computing taxable income even if no tax was withheld, provided the other requirements for deductibility have been met. However, the taxpayer shall still be liable for the payment of the corresponding withholding tax due on said income payments.\n\nAll are enjoined to give this Circular a wide publicity as possible.\n\n(SGD.)

Thus, concerns on the processing and issuance of electronic Certificate Authorizing Registration (eCAR) pertaining to One-Time Transaction (ONETT) arose since under current policy, the payment of taxes related to ONETT is required to be made with AABs/RCOs under the jurisdiction of the Revenue District Office (RDO) responsible in the processing and issuance of eCAR to facilitate validation of tax payments prior to the approval of eCAR. HTcADC\n\nIn view thereof, this Circular is issued to put clarity on the aforesaid concern. The venue for the processing and issuance of eCAR, regardless of where the tax return and the tax payments were made, shall still be at the RDO which has jurisdiction over the ONETT, as follows:\n\na. Sales of real property \u2014 RDO which has jurisdiction over the location of the property subject of sale;\n\nb. Sale of personal property \u2014 RDO which has jurisdiction over the residence of the seller;\n\nc. Donation \u2014 RDO which has jurisdiction over the residence of the donor (individual)/RDO where the donor is registered (non-individual); and\n\nd. Estate \u2014 RDO which has jurisdiction over the issued Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) of the Estate of the Decedent.\n\nIf the decedent has registered business, however, the processing of eCAR shall be processed by the RDO where the business is registered since it is where the TIN for the decedent shall likewise be secured pursuant to existing policy. In case the decedent has no registered business, the TIN may be secured from the RDO where the administrator or heirs intend to apply for the issuance of eCAR.\n\nTaxpayers who will need BIR's assistance in the computation of tax pertaining to ONETT are encouraged to proceed with the RDO which has jurisdiction over the ONETT as stated above to secure approved ONETT Computation Sheet, which shall then be the basis in the subsequent filing of the requisite tax return. CAIHTE\n\nFor taxpayer's convenience, they may also use the electronic ONETT (eONETT) system in the application for the issuance of eCAR.

However, in case of unavailability/inaccessibility of the electronic platforms, manual filing of the AITR may be allowed.\n\nFor payment of income tax due, it shall be made either electronically in any of the available electronic payment (ePay) gateways or manually to any Authorized Agent Bank (AAB) or Revenue Collection Officer (RCO) of any Revenue District Office (RDO).\n\nAll individual taxpayers, regardless of classification, shall use the existing version of BIR Form Nos. 1701 or 1701A, whichever is applicable, in the filing of their 2023 AITR.

No. 11976 [Ease of Paying Taxes (EOPT)] Act shall be used in the filing of the 2024 AITR, which is due next year (on or before April 15, 2025).\n\nThe Guidelines in the filing of the AITR for the Calendar Year 2023 and the payment of taxes due thereon are as follows:\n\nI.

Electronic Filing and Payment System (eFPS) Filers/Users\n\nTaxpayers mandated to use the eFPS shall file the AITR electronically and pay the taxes due thereon through the eFPS-Authorized Agent Banks (AABs) where they are enrolled. The AITRs available in the eFPS are BIR Form Nos. 1700, 1701A, 1701, 1702RT and 1702-EX.

The tax type to be used is Income Tax (IT) and the Alphanumeric Tax Code (ATC) is MC 200 \u2014 Miscellaneous Tax.\n\nLikewise, the said taxpayers shall use the eBIRForms facility in the filing of their AITR in case filing cannot be made through the eFPS due to the following reasons: CAIHTE\n\n1. Enrollment in BIR-eFPS and eFPS-AAB is still in process;\n\n2. The enhanced form is not yet available in the eFPS;\n\n3. Unavailability of BIR-eFPS covered by an Advisory published in the BIR Website (www.bir.gov.ph); or\n\n4.

                                    "Details": "This Circular is being issued to address and clarify the issues raised on Revenue Memorandum Circular (RMC) No. 5-2024. [1] HTcADC\n\nQ1: Does the ruling in Aces Philippines Cellular Satellite Corp. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, [2] finding that the source of income of the Satellite Air Time Purchase Agreement between Aces Bermuda and Aces Philippines to be within the Philippines and, thus, subject to income tax, automatically apply to international service provision or cross-border services agreements listed in Question No. 2 of RMC No. 5-2024?\n\nA1. No. Question No. 2 of RMC No. 5-2024 listed international service provision or cross-border services (e.g., Consulting Services, IT Consulting, Financial Services, etc.) only to highlight that \u2014 like Aces Philippines \u2014 these services are likewise performed, rendered, delivered, or supplied by a non-resident foreign corporation (NRFC) to a domestic/resident entity in the Philippines. There is nothing therein expressly stating that the decision in Aces Philippines, finding the source of income of the service agreement to be within the Philippines and, thus, subject to final withholding tax, automatically applies to the listed international service provision or cross-border services.\n\nThe determination on whether the source of income of the listed cross-border services is within the Philippines is found in Question No. 3 of RMC No. 5-2024 using the long-standing rule that, the source of income is in the Philippines if the property, activity or service that produces the income is in the Philippines. The flow of wealth proceeded from, and occurred within the Philippine territory, enjoying the protection accorded by the Philippine government.\n\nThe determination of the source of income involves an examination of all the components of the cross-border service agreement involving two tax jurisdictions (i.e., residence of the NRFC and the Philippines), taking into account the services to be performed in its entirety, and not singled out or compartmentalized one particular activity as the income producing activity. This approach is aligned with the Civil Code provision that, there is performance when \"the thing or service in which the obligation consists has been completely delivered or rendered, as the case may be.\" [3] Crucial factors to such determination are on whether the cross-border services are dependent on the successful use, consumption or utilization by the Philippine purchaser of the service for income to be accrued; or on whether the performance of the service depends on the facilities located in the Philippines; or on whether the particular stages occurring in the Philippines are so integral to the over-all transaction that the business activity would not have been accomplished without it; among others. CAIHTE\n\nQ2: Do the principles laid down in RMC No. 5-2024 run counter to the rules on the source of income under Section 42 of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended (Tax Code)?\n\nA2: No. Question No. 3 of RMC No. 5-2024 clearly spelled out the main guideline in determining the source of income for cross-border services identified in Question No. 2 (Consulting Services, IT Outsourcing, Financial Services, etc.), and, that is, \"the source of income is in the Philippines if the property, activity or service that produces the income is in the Philippines. The flow of wealth proceeded from, and occurred within the Philippine territory, enjoying the protection accorded by the Philippine government.\"\n\nNotably, the traditional rule on recognizing income under Section 42(A)(3) and (C)(3) of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended (Tax Code), for labor or personal service is where the labor or service is performed. But in Aces Philippines, the Supreme Court held that, \"[i]n ascertaining the income source, We must inquire into the property, activity, or service that produced the income, or where the inflow of wealth originated. It is insufficient to identify just any property or activity, or service. The subject may only be regarded as an income source if the particular property, activity or service causes an increase in economic benefits, which may be in the form of an inflow or enhancement of assets or a decrease in liabilities with a corresponding increase in equity other than that attributable to a capital contribution.\"\n\nUltimately, therefore, following the above-pronouncement, the situs of the source of income for labor or personal service is not just the location but, more importantly, the location of the service that produces the income or where the inflow of wealth originates.\n\nQ3: What is the meaning of the following statements in Question No. 7 of RMC 5-2024?\n\n\"Even if the services are conducted or paid abroad, but there are activities to be performed in the Philippines so essential that the entire service transaction cannot be accomplished without them, then, the benefits received theory applies. This means that the revenue-generating activity actually occurs within the Philippines. The income generated by the foreign company providing the services, which are considered sources within the Philippines, shall be subject to income tax and, consequently to final withholding tax.\"\n\nA3: The premise of such statements is that the service agreement occurs in multiple stages across different taxing jurisdictions, i.e., jurisdiction of the NRFC and the Philippines. In such a situation, it is vitally important to examine all the components of the cross-border service agreement directly between the NRFC and the domestic/resident entity in the Philippines, looking at the services to be performed in its entirety, and not singled out or compartmentalized one particular activity as the income producing activity. Again, this approach is consistent with the Civil Code provision that, there is performance when \"the thing or service in which the obligation consists has been completely delivered or rendered.\" As stated in Question No. 3 of RMC 5-2024, \"in such instances, it becomes imperative to ascertain whether the particular stages occurring in the Philippines are so integral to the overall transaction that the business activity would not have accomplished without them. If the income-generating activities in the Philippines are deemed essential, the income derived from these activities would be considered as sourced from the Philippines for tax purposes, irrespective of where the payment is ultimately received. This principle aligns with the benefits-received theory in taxation, which submits that the jurisdiction providing the essential services or factors for income generation should be entitled to tax that income.\" aScITE\n\nIn the end, what applies in the aforesaid scenario is still the well-established rule that, \"[i]n ascertaining the income source, we must inquire into the property, activity, or service that produced the income, or where the inflow of wealth originated,\" highlighting that, \"it is insufficient to identify just any property or activity, or service. The subject may only be regarded as an income source if the particular property, activity or service causes an increase in economic benefits which may be in the form of an inflow or enhancement of assets or a decrease in liabilities with a corresponding increase in equity other than that attributable to a capital contribution.\"\n\nQ4: Essentially, what is the benefits-received theory as reiterated and applied by the Supreme Court in Aces Philippines for purposes of determining the situs or place of taxation?\n\nA4: In Aces Philippines, the Supreme Court held that, \". . . where the inflow of wealth and/or economic benefits proceeds from, and occurs within the Philippine territory, it enjoys protection of the Philippine government. In consideration of such protection, the flow of wealth should share the burden of supporting the government, [4] and thus, is subject to tax.\" This is essentially the benefits-received theory.\n\nQ5: Are the rules enunciated in RMC No. 5-2024 inconsistent with the provisions of tax treaties?\n\nA5. No. As propounded above, RMC No. 5-2024 merely set forth the guidelines to establish the source of taxation for cross-border services listed in Question No. 2 (Consulting Service, IT Outsourcing, Financial Services, etc.), which is, that the source of taxation is the property, activity, or service that produces the income or where the inflow of wealth originates. DETACa\n\nOnce the source of income is established to be within the Philippines using the aforesaid guidelines, then, the affected taxpayer can invoke the application of a particular tax treaty to assert that the income derived or sourced within the Philippines (e.g., business profits, dividends, royalties or interests) is exempt from income tax for lack of permanent establishment or subject to preferential rate, as the case may be. In short, the application of the benefits of the tax treaty, such as tax exemption of business profits for lack of permanent establishment, presupposes that the situs of the source of income is in the Philippines.\n\nCurrently, the Philippines has forty-four (44) existing tax treaties with other tax jurisdictions. [5]\n\nThe provisions, therefore, of RMC No. 5-2024 are not inconsistent with those of the tax treaties entered into by the Philippines.\n\nQ6: If it is established that the source of income of cross-border services is within the Philippines applying the rule that the source of income is the location of the property, activity, or service that produces the income, will the subject transaction be also subject to VAT?\n\nA6. Yes. Sections 105 and 108 of the Tax Code provide that services rendered or performed in the Philippines by non-resident foreign persons are subject to VAT.\n\nSection 108 also subject non-resident foreign persons from VAT if their services involve, among others:\n\n(a) the lease or the use of or the privilege to use any copyright, patent, design or model, plan, secret formula or process, goodwill, trademark, trade brand or other like property or right;\n\n(b) the lease or the use of, the right to use of any industrial, commercial or scientific equipment;\n\n(c) the supply of scientific, technical, industrial or commercial knowledge or information;\n\n(d) the supply of technical advice, assistance or services rendered in connection with technical management or administration of any scientific, industrial or commercial undertaking, venture, project or scheme; among others.\n\nPursuant to Section 114(C) of the Tax Code, and as implemented by Section 4.114-2 of Revenue Regulations (RR) No 16-2005, as amended, the mode of VAT collection on payment for lease or use of property rights owned, and other services rendered in the Philippines, by non-resident foreign persons is thru withholding. HEITAD\n\nQ7: Why is Question No. 4 on reimbursable or allocable expenses for cross-border services between or among related parties also included in RMC No. 5-2024?\n\nA7: RMC No. 5-2024 further clarifies the proper tax treatment of cross-border services in light of the Aces Philippines decision. Cross-border services usually involve related parties, common of which are intra-group services, like management, financial and administrative services; technical and support services; purchasing, marketing and distribution services; and other commercial services provided in connection with the nature of the group's business. As these are intra-group services, issues, such as on whether their pricing of such services is arm's length, may arise. As such, it is deemed necessary to also lay down the basic rules on reimbursable or allocable expenses for services between or among related parties to have a wholistic approach insofar as the determination of the proper tax treatment of cross-border services is concerned.\n\nLike any other cross-border service agreement, the source of income is not determined by where income is disbursed or physically received but rather where the business activity that produced such income is actually conducted. [6] The determination of the source of income for the charges made by the parent entity or affiliates to a related local company for the services made by the former to the latter is still the time-honored rule, as reiterated by the Supreme Court in Aces Philippines, that, \"in ascertaining the income source, we must inquire into the property, activity, or service that produced the income, or where the inflow of wealth originated,\" putting emphasis that, \"the subject may only be regarded as an income source if the particular property, activity or service causes an increase in economic benefits, which may be in the form of an inflow or enhancement of assets or a decrease in liabilities with a corresponding increase in equity other than that attributable to a capital contribution.\"\n\nQ8: Is the 25% final withholding on gross income received by non-resident foreign person from all sources within the Philippines, including the 12% final withholding VAT on payment for lease or use of properties rights owned, and other services rendered in the Philippines, by non-resident foreign person, a new imposition?\n\nA8: No. The 25% final withholding on gross income received by non-resident foreign person from all sources within the Philippines is clearly provided for in Sections 25(B) and 28(B) of the Tax Code. On the other hand, the 12% final withholding VAT on payment for lease or use of property rights owned, and other services rendered in the Philippines, by non-resident foreign person is pursuant to Sections 105, 108 and 114(C) of the Tax Code, and as implemented by Section 4.114-2 of RR No. 16-2005, as amended. aDSIHc\n\nAll internal revenue officers, employees and others concerned are hereby enjoined to give this Circular the widest dissemination and publicity as possible.\n\nThis Circular shall take effect immediately.\n\n(SGD.)

HTcADC\n\nIt is in the light of the said changes/transformation that the BIR needs also to change its institutional symbol, the BIR Logo, to make it more representative of the directions of the current administration, which are geared towards delivery of excellent taxpayer service through modernization and digitalization of core processes and frontline services, as the Bureau performs its \"mission of collecting taxes through just enforcement of tax laws\" guided by its principle of \"service excellence with integrity and professionalism.\"\n\nTo change the design of the BIR Logo, a Contest is hereby announced wherein all revenuers and external stakeholders (individuals) are invited to submit their proposed design of the new BIR Logo that shall depict the Bureau's directions, as stated above, while still keeping the elements of the agency's mandate of revenue generation.\n\nI.

ROMEO D. LUMAGUI, JR.\nCommissioner of Internal Revenue\n\nATTACHMENT\n\nSummary of Section 51 of the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of Republic Act No. 8491 (the Flag and Heraldic Code of the Philippines)\n\n\u2022 Symbols and Colors to be incorporated in the design should be relevant to the name, history and culture of the town/city/province in the case of Local Government Units the function and mandate of the agency (in case of National Government Agencies).\n\n\u2022 Symbols, which are indigenous to the Philippines and/or are symbolic of Filipino culture, values, history and traditions, are preferred over western heraldic charges.\n\n\u2022 Simple designs over elaborate ones are preferred and parsimony on detail is encouraged; as symbols and charges should remain recognizable whenever the seal is rendered or reproduced in smaller sizes.\n\n\u2022 The names and images of living persons cannot be incorporated in the design. Images of deceased persons are to be depicted in profile (sideways).\n\n\u2022 Personal Heraldry is prohibited, and with the sole exception of Catholic and Episcopalian Bishops, personal arms are only assumed in pretence and have no official recognition. The President and the Vice-President of the Philippines may use the seals of their respective offices in a personal capacity, but only for the duration of their terms of office.\n\n\u2022 Seals, unlike emblems and coats of arms, should prominently feature the names of their bearer offices, and, by discretion of the bearer agency, may (or may not) also include the foundation year of the institution and a motto relevant to its mandate, aims and objectives.\n\n\u2022 The Coat of Arms of the Republic can only-be used by National Government Agencies, and the National Flag can only be used in the seals by Local Government Units which has a historical association with it.\n\nTraditional Rules of Heraldry\n\n1. Division of the Field (and Precedence of Charges): In order to avoid a cluttered design, charges (i.e., symbols) should be evenly distributed in the field in delineated compartments. Said symbols should also follow a natural progression \u2014 the most important symbols should be larger in size and in a more prominent position, and lesser symbols should be of a smaller size relative to that of the principal symbols. DETACa\n\n2. The Rule of Tincture: Heraldic tradition limits the colors which may be used in coats of arms and emblems to seven, namely: Yellow, White, Red, Green, Blue, Purple and Black, each referred to with special names and classified into two types \u2014 Metals and Tinctures:\n\n\u2022 Metals: Or (Yellow) and Argent (White), colors which are considered equivalent to the precious metals of Gold and Silver.\n\n\u2022 Tinctures: Azure (Blue) Gules (Red) Vert (Green) Purpure (Purple) and Sable (Black), colors equivalent to dyes derived from the following naturally-occurring substances: Lapis Lazuli and later the Indigo plant (Blue), Cinnabar (Red), chlorophyll from leaves (Green), the secretion from Tyrian sea snails (Purple) and soot from charcoal (Black).\n\n\u2022 The rule of Tincture is simple: Metals should not be used with Metals, and Tinctures should not be used alongside Tinctures, as to provide a nice contrast and make the charges visible against their respective backgrounds. This rule is not hard and fast, as there are instances where the rule is disregarded especially in the case of metal-to-metal (e.g., the Coat of Arms of the Republic of the Philippines with a golden-yellow sun and stars on a white background), but it remains worth observing, considering that yellow and white contrasts well with the otherwise strong hues of other colors.",

Within two (2) months from the effectivity of RMC No. 49-2022: Those enjoying 5% GIT regime but are still VAT-registered at the time the CREATE Act took effect.\n\nThe said RMC likewise provides that if the taxpayer has other activities other than those registered with the Investment Promotion Agency (IPA) that are subject to VAT (i.e., VAT at 12% and 0%), it shall remain as a VAT taxpayer and shall report the sales in the VAT returns as VATable, zero-rated and/or VAT-exempt, as the case may be.\n\nOn the basis of the said guidelines, some importers of petroleum products located in freeport zones or special economic zones which do not have other activities other than those registered with the IPA changed their registration status from VAT-registered entity to non-VAT in order to avail of either the 5% GIT or SCIT regime.\n\nHowever, a disparity of treatment inadvertently arose between petroleum importers located inside the freeport zone or special economic zone and those located within the customs territory in the application of the guidelines in Q & A No. 31 of RMC No. 49-2022 in conjunction with the intention of Section 295 (F) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, which states: CAIHTE\n\n\"(F) Persons who directly import petroleum products defined under Republic Act No. 8479, otherwise known as the 'Downstream Oil Industry Deregulation Act of 1998,' for resale in the Philippine customs territory and/or in free zones as defined under Republic Act No. 10863, otherwise known as the Customs Modernization and Tariff Act, shall not be entitled to the foregoing tax and duty incentives, and shall be subject to appropriate taxes imposed under this Code.\n\nAny law to the contrary notwithstanding, the importation of petroleum products by any person, including registered business enterprises shall be subject to the payment of applicable duties and taxes as provided under Republic Act No. 10863, otherwise known as the Customs Modernization and Tariff Act, and this Code, respectively, upon importation into the Philippine customs territory and/or into free zones as defined under Republic Act No. 10863, otherwise known as the Customs Modernization and Tariff Act:\n\nProvided, That the importer can file for claims for the refund of duties and taxes applicable under Republic Act No. 10863, otherwise known as the Customs Modernization and Tariff Act, and this Code, respectively, for direct or indirect export of petroleum products, and/or tax-exempt sales under the Customs Modernization and Tariff Act and other special laws within the period provided therein:\n\nProvided, further, That the importers who subsequently export fuel, subject to the appropriate rules of the fuel marking program, may apply for a refund of duties and taxes, as applicable under Republic Act No. 10863, otherwise known as the Customs Modernization and Tariff Act, and this Code.\"\n\nBased on the foregoing, REE petroleum importers, including those located inside the freeport zones or special economic zones, were required to pay the applicable duties and taxes on their import transactions including VAT. Correspondingly, they may be refunded of the duties and taxes for the direct or indirect export of petroleum products, and/or tax-exempt sales pursuant to RR No. 4-2022.\n\nIn relation thereto, under Section 112 (A) of the Tax Code of 1997, as amended, provides that only VAT-registered persons or entity may file for VAT refund. Hence, this clarification.\n\nTherefore, the Bureau hereby clarifies that REEs enjoying the 5% GIT or SCIT located within freeport zones or special economic zones, which directly import petroleum products and do not have other activities subject to VAT, shall be permitted to register as a VAT taxpayer to allow them to file for refund of input VAT incurred from importation of petroleum attributable to zero-rated sales pursuant to RR No. 4-2022. aScITE\n\nThis Circular shall be applied prospectively. Previous transactions of petroleum products importers located in freeport zones or special economic zones, which changed their status from VAT to non-VAT pursuant to RMC No. 49-2022, are not covered by this Circular.\n\nAll other issuances inconsistent herewith are hereby repealed and modified accordingly.\n\nAll internal revenue officers and employees are hereby enjoined to give this Circular a wide publicity, as possible.\n\nThis Circular shall take effect immediately.\n\n(SGD.)

SDAaTC\n\nThis Circular is hereby issued for the guidance of all concerned to prescribe the timeline and implementation procedures of RR No. 16-2023 in compliance with Section 3 of the said RR, and to address the potential issues and concerns which may arise from the implementation thereof.\n\nQ1: When is the effectivity of RR No. 16-2023?\n\nA1: Pursuant to Section 6 of RR No. 16-2023, the withholding tax obligation of e-marketplace operator and DFSPs shall take effect after fifteen (15) days following its publication in a newspaper of general circular or the Official Gazette, whichever comes first. RR No. 16-2023 was first published in Manila Bulletin on December 27, 2023. Thus, RR No. 16-2023 shall take effect on January 11, 2024.\n\nQ2: Is there a transitory period?\n\nA2: Yes. The e-marketplace operators and DFSPs are allowed a period of ninety (90) days from the date of issuance of this Circular to comply with the relative policies or requirements of other government agencies, if any, and to give them an opportunity to adjust and properly comply with the provisions of RR No. 16-2023 prior to the actual imposition of the prescribed creditable withholding tax. Further, existing unregistered sellers/merchants shall comply with the applicable requirements enumerated in Q4-A4 of this Circular within the same prescribed period.\n\nQ3: What constitutes the annual total gross remittances of P500,000.00 to an online seller/merchant for purposes of not subjecting it from the prescribed creditable withholding tax?\n\nA3: The gross remittances of P500,000.00 shall consist of the total amount of remittances received by the online seller/merchant from ALL e-marketplace operators and DFSPs; provided, however, that, in case any of the e-marketplace operators and DFSPs has determined that the gross remittances in its online platform exceeded P500,000.00 anytime during the taxable year, the prescribed withholding tax shall be automatically deducted from the particular remittance exceeding the said threshold and the same shall be imposed on subsequent remittances. AaCTcI\n\nQ4: What are the obligations of sellers/merchants under RR No. 16-2023?\n\nA4: Sellers/Merchants are required to observe the following:\n\n1. Register their business with the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) and submit a copy of the BIR-issued Certificate of Registration as part of the documentary requirements by e-marketplace operator prior to the use of the e-marketplace facility.\n\nIf the gross remittance received from the e-marketplace operators or DFSPs is determined and/or expected not to exceed the threshold of P500,000.00, submit a Sworn Declaration (SD) duly received by the BIR and in the form prescribed in Annex \"A\" of this Circular upon application (or within the transitory period in case of existing participant sellers/merchants of e-marketplace operators and DFSPs) with e-marketplace or DFSP declaring that the total gross remittance to be received from the e-marketplace operators or DFSPs shall not exceed P500,000.00. The BIR-received SD shall be submitted thereafter on or before the 20th day of the first month of each taxable year.\n\nIn case of failure to submit the prescribed SD, regardless of the actual total income or gross remittance, the withholding tax imposed by RR No. 16-2023 shall automatically be deducted by the e-marketplace operator or DFSP.\n\nShould the gross remittances exceed the P500,000.00 at any time during the taxable year, the prescribed BIR-received SD shall be immediately submitted to the e-marketplace operators or DFSPs by the sellers/merchants.\n\nIllustration:\n\nTaxable year is from January to December 2024.\n\nIn March 2024 (the month of application or within the transitory period for existing participant seller/merchant), a BIR-received SD is submitted by the seller/merchant to the e-marketplace operators and DFSPs declaring that the threshold is determined (from previous year) and/or expected (current year) to not exceed P500,000.00. Consequently, all gross remittances starting March 2024 will not be subjected to withholding tax.\n\nHowever, in August 2024, it was determined by the seller/merchant that the gross remittances exceeded the threshold, hence, a BIR-received SD indicating that the gross remittances exceed P500,000.00 shall be submitted by such seller/merchant to the e-marketplace operators and DFSPs declaring such and withholding shall commence. On January 20, 2025, withholding of taxes continues and there is no need to submit a BIR-received SD considering that it qualifies under Section 2.57.2(X) of RR No. 2-98, as amended by RR No. 16-2023. acEHCD\n\nIf it was determined that the total gross remittances for taxable year 2025 to the seller/merchant have not exceeded the threshold, it shall submit on or before January 20, 2026 to the e-marketplace operators and DFSPs a BIR-received SD declaring that the threshold is determined (from previous year) and/or expected (current year) to not exceed P500,000.00. Therefore, all gross remittances during taxable year 2026 will not be subjected to withholding tax.\n\n2. If a seller/merchant is exempt from income tax or subject to a lower income tax rate pursuant to any existing law or treaty, submit a duly issued certification to the e-marketplace operator as proof of exemption or entitlement to a lower tax rate pursuant to the provisions of Section 2 of RR No. 16-2023, which states:\n\n'(c) if the seller/merchant is duly exempt from or subject to a lower income tax rate pursuant to any existing law or treaty. Provided that, the concerned seller/merchant is able to secure the necessary certification, clearance, ruling, or any other document serving as proof of entitlement to the said exemption or lower income tax rate. The said proof of entitlement shall be submitted by the seller/merchant to the e-marketplace operator or digital financial services provider concerned.'\n\nQ5: Are existing unregistered sellers/merchants selling goods and services in an e-marketplace or DFSP required to register with BIR?\n\nA5: Yes. All existing sellers/merchants selling goods and services in an e-marketplace not yet BIR-registered shall register their businesses with BIR pursuant to the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended (Tax Code). Moreover, after the transitory period prescribed under this Circular, e-marketplace operators and DFSPs shall not allow unregistered businesses to sell goods and services in their platform/facility.\n\nQ6: What are the obligations of e-marketplace operators and DFSPs under RA No. 16-2023?\n\nA6: E-marketplace operators and DFSPs are required to observe the following: EcTCAD\n\n1. Ensure that all sellers/merchants applying for the use of the e-marketplace or DFSP platforms are registered with the BIR by requiring the submission of their Certificate of Registration (BIR Form No. 2303) prior to allowing sellers/merchants to use the e-marketplace facility or DFSP platform, as the case may be.\n\n2. Require sellers/merchants who are duly exempt from or subject to a lower income tax rate pursuant to any existing law or treaty to submit the necessary certification or any other document as proof of entitlement to the said exemption or lower income tax rate.\n\n3. Require sellers/merchants to submit a copy of the BIR-received SD. In case the sellers/merchants failed to submit the BIR-received SD, regardless of the actual income or gross remittances, the withholding tax shall be automatically deducted under RR No. 16-2023.\n\nFurther, when the seller/merchant failed to submit the required BIR-received SD to the e-marketplace operator or DFSP within the prescribed period, the withholding tax shall likewise be automatically deducted.\n\n4. Monitor the gross payments of buyers/customers and deduct the withholding tax prescribed under RR No. 16-2023 before subsequently remitting the same to the concerned sellers/merchants.\n\n5. Provide sellers/merchants the Certificate of Creditable Tax Withheld at Source (BIR Form No. 2307) within the period prescribed under the Tax Code, and other relevant revenue issuances, or upon request by the sellers/merchants.\n\nQ7: When will the withholding tax obligation of the e-marketplace operator and DFSP commence in cases where the accumulated gross remittances to a seller/merchant exceed the prescribed P500,000.00 threshold?\n\nA7: The withholding tax obligation shall commence:\n\n1. Upon receipt by the e-marketplace operator and DFSP of the BIR-received SD indicating that the sellers/merchants have exceeded the P500,000.00; or\n\n2. When the seller/merchant failed to submit the required BIR-received SD to the e-marketplace operator or DFSP within the prescribed period; or\n\n3. When the e-marketplace operator or DFSP has determined that its total gross remittances to the concerned seller/merchant have exceeded the P500,000.00 threshold. SDHTEC\n\nQ8: Are sellers/merchants allowed to receive payments through their personal/individual accounts instead of a business account?\n\nA8: No. The sellers/merchants are not allowed to receive payments through their personal/individual accounts. In all payments/remittances/transfers covered under RR No. 16-2023, the seller/merchant's account shall, at all times, be under the BIR-registered tradename of the seller/merchant. The BIR shall monitor usage of account under the registered tradename of the seller/merchant.\n\nQ9: Mr. Mark is a rider of Go Movers, a platform for carriage of goods and merchandise. Go Movers offers a purchase service wherein their rider will buy and pay for the goods and deliver the same to the buyer. Upon delivery, the buyer will pay the cost of goods and delivery fee and purchase service fee, if any, directly to the rider.\n\nMs. Glyza booked a purchase service in the Go Movers mobile application and set the location of the store as the pick-up point and her location as the drop-off point. She messaged Mr. Mark, the assigned rider for her booking, with the list of goods to be bought. Mr. Mark purchased the goods at the store and delivered the same to Ms. Glyza. She paid the cost of goods, the delivery fee and purchase service fee in cash directly to Mr. Mark.\n\nIs this scenario subject to withholding tax under RR No. RR 16-2023?\n\nA9: This scenario is not subject to withholding tax considering that Go Movers did not collect the payment of the buyer, in behalf of the seller; hence, the platform does not remit income payment to the seller or store. Rather, Mr. Mark advanced the payment to the store and received the payment from the buyer only upon the delivery of the goods.\n\nIn case the e-marketplace platform accepts or collects payment for the goods and remits the same to the seller, this shall be subject to withholding pursuant to RR No. 16-2023 where withholding tax shall be deducted before its remittance of the income payment to the seller.\n\nQ10: CashLess is a digital financial services provider where users deposit funds into their account and utilize the cash value to settle payments.\n\nMr. Daniel uses CashLess to settle his monthly electric bills payable to Light Supply, an electricity provider company. Light Supply is listed as a merchant at CashLess where users may settle their electric bills using CashLess' online platform. Mr. Daniel uses his funds at CashLess to settle his bills.\n\nCashLess has contracted PayNow as its payment aggregator/facilitator of payments to accredited billers/merchants.\n\nWho shall deduct the withholding tax before remittance to the seller/merchant pursuant to RR No. 16-2023? HSAcaE\n\nA10: In the event that the payment is transmitted to the seller/merchant through different facilities, the last facility which has control of the payment before completely remitting the same to the seller/merchant shall be liable to withhold the taxes under RR No. 16-2023. In this case, only the remittance of payment from PayNow (payment aggregator) to Light Supply (the seller/merchant) shall be subject to withholding tax under RR No. 16-2023.\n\nQ11: What BIR form and Alphanumeric Tax Code (ATC) shall be filed and used by e-marketplace operators and DFSPs?\n\nA11: BIR Form Nos. 0619-E for the first two months of the quarter and a revised 1601-EQ for the last or third month of the quarter which is inclusive of the additional ATC for creditable withholding tax imposed by RR No. 16-2023 shall be issued through another RMC.\n\nQ12: What are the penalties in case of violation of any of the provisions of RR No. 16-2023?\n\nA12: The violation of any of the provisions of RR No. 16-2023 shall be subject to appropriate penalties under the Tax Code, relevant laws, rules and regulations.\n\nAll internal revenue officials, employees and others concerned are hereby enjoined to give this Circular as wide publicity as possible.\n\n(SGD.)

                                    "Details": "This Circular is being issued to further clarify the proper tax treatment of cross-border services in light of the Supreme Court's En Banc Decision in Aces Philippines Cellular Satellite Corp. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, G.R. No. 226680, dated August 30, 2022. The Circular offers a framework for assessing the final withholding tax and final withholding Value-Added Tax (VAT) of the activities of non-resident foreign corporation (NRFC) within the Philippine jurisdiction, allowing the Bureau to make informed determinations based on established legal interpretations. As such, the Court's Decision serves as a valuable reference point for the Bureau in evaluating and addressing tax considerations related to the services rendered by NRFCs, contributing to a clearer understanding of the tax obligations associated with such transactions.\n\nQ1: What are the salient features of the Supreme Court's En Banc Decision in Aces Philippines?\n\nA1: The following are the relevant salient features of the Decision of the Supreme Court concerning final withholding tax on income payments abroad. The satellite airtime fee payments in this case were income payments made by Aces Philippines (payor/withholding agent) to Aces Bermuda (payee/income earner), a NRFC, for the satellite airtime services it provided to Aces Philippines: ATICcS\n\n\"xxx xxx xxx\n\nResolving the issue of whether the satellite air time fee payments to Aces Bermuda is subject to FWT requires a two-tiered approach, where we identify, first, the source of the income and, second, the situs of that source.\n\nA.\nIdentifying the source\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n\"Income\" refers to the flow of wealth. In ascertaining the income source, We must inquire into the property, activity, or service that produced the income, or where the inflow of wealth originated. It is insufficient to identify just any property, activity, or service. The subject may only be regarded as an income source if the particular property, activity, or service causes an increase in economic benefits, which may be in the form of an inflow or enhancement of assets or a decrease in liabilities with a corresponding increase in equity other than that attributable to a capital contribution. (emphasis and underscoring supplied)\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\nThe Court agrees with the CTA that the income-generating activity takes place not during the act of transmission but only upon the gateway's receipt of the call as routed by the satellite. The Court identifies the gateway's receipt of the call as the income source as it coincides with (1) the completion or delivery of the service, and (2) the inflow of economic benefits in favor of Aces Bermuda. (underscoring supplied)\n\n(1) The [Philippine] gateway's receipt\nof the routed call marks the\ncompletion or delivery of the\nservice.\n\nIn rejecting Aces Philippines' attempt to single out the act of transmission as the income-producing activity, the Court echoes the CTA En Banc's keen observation that \"there is a continuous and very real connection\" within the components of the Aces System (emphasis and underscoring supplied); and\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\nIn other words, the satellite air time fees accrue only when the satellite air time is delivered to Aces Philippines (i.e., upon the gateway's receipt of the routed call) and is utilized by the Philippine subscriber for a voice or data call. The accrual of fees payable to Aces Bermuda signifies the inflow of economic benefits. (underscoring supplied)\n\nB.\nIdentifying the situs\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\nAfter having identified the source of income, We now inquire into its situs. It is settled that where the inflow of wealth and/or economic benefits proceeds from, and occurs within Philippine territory, it enjoys protection of the Philippine government. In consideration of such protection, the flow of wealth should share the burden of supporting the government, and thus, is subject to tax. aDSIHc\n\nThe following establishes the Philippine situs of Aces Bermuda's income from satellite air time fee payments: (1) the income-generating activity is directly associated with the gateways located within the Philippine territory; and (2) engaging in the business of providing satellite communication services in the Philippines is a government regulated industry. (underscoring supplied)\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\nTo stress, the income-generating activity (i.e., accrual of satellite airtime fee payments and completion of the principal undertaking) coincides with the receipt of the routed call by gateways located within Philippine territory. That income generation is dependent on the operations of facilities situated in the Philippines contributes to the income's Philippine situs. Verily, the gateways are legally owned by Aces Philippines. Nonetheless, Aces Bermuda has sufficient economic/beneficial interest in these Philippine properties, inasmuch as its Philippine operations are dependent on these local facilities. (underscoring supplied)\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\nAll told, that the main asset is situated in outer space cannot be determinative of the income source and the situs thereof. At this point, it is clear that: (a) Aces Bermuda's income attaches to property operated and maintained in the Philippines, and (b) making Aces Services available to Philippine subscribers, albeit through its local service provider, is an endeavor that requires the intervention of the Philippine government. In the Court's view, it is only fair that this income be subjected to Philippine taxation; to hold Aces Bermuda accountable for its share in compensating the government for the protection it accords to Aces Bermuda's arrangements, operations, and related transactions in the Philippines. (underscoring supplied)\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\nAces Philippines failed to establish\nthat the satellite air time fee payments\nare foreign-sourced.\n\nThe rule is that the taxpayer bears the burden of proving that the \"income was from sources outside the Philippines and exempt from the application of our income tax law. HEITAD\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\nThe statements merely narrated that the satellite is situated in outer space but did not contradict the finding that Aces Bermuda's service is completed and performed in the Philippines. (underscoring supplied)\n\nxxx xxx xxx\"\n\nQ2: What are the existing cross-border services akin to that of Aces vs. CIR?\n\nA2: International Service Provision (or cross-border services) \u2014 A service-based company operates in various countries, providing services to clients. The income earned is allocated to the countries where the services are performed, taking into accounts factors such as the time spent, resources utilized, or value created in each jurisdiction. The source of income is determined by the location of the business activity rather than the disbursement or receipt of funds.\n\nInternational service provision includes the following or similar transactions:\n\n1. Consulting Services \u2014 A consulting firm based in one country provides advisory or consulting services to clients located in different countries. The firm may offer expertise in various areas such as management, finance, technology, or marketing. The consulting is carried abroad, but the results or outputs are used locally. The payment to the foreign consulting firm is considered an inflow of economic benefits to the foreign company. The income is sourced within the Philippines.\n\n2. IT Outsourcing \u2014 A technology company in one country offers IT outsourcing services to businesses located in different countries. This can involve services like software development, system maintenance, network management, or customer support.\n\n3. Financial Services \u2014 Banks, investment firms, or insurance companies operating internationally provide financial services to clients across borders. This can include services like asset management, wealth advisory, international banking, or insurance coverage.\n\n4. Telecommunications \u2014 Telecommunication companies offer services such as international calling, data connectivity, or internet services to customers located in different countries. These services enable global communication and connectivity.\n\n5. Engineering and Construction \u2014 Engineering and construction firms undertake projects in different countries, providing services like architectural design, project management, infrastructure development, or construction services.\n\n6. Education and Training \u2014 Educational institutions or training providers offer international programs, courses, or professional training to students or professionals from various countries. This can involve language courses, academic programs, vocational training, or skill development courses.\n\n7. Tourism and Hospitality \u2014 Travel agencies, hotels, online booking application, or tour operators cater to tourists, providing services like, planning, accommodation, transportation, tour packages, or entertainment activities.

Other Similar Services \u2014 refers to services that are not specifically mentioned above but still follow the same concept of being provided, processed, or performed overseas and then utilized, applied, executed, or consumed within the Philippines.\n\nQ3: Based on the above-discussion by the Court in Aces Philippines, how would you establish the situs of taxation for the aforesaid cross-border services?\n\nA3: The revenue-generating activity occurs within the Philippines.\n\nIt is settled that the source of income is in the Philippines if the property, activity or service that produces the income is in the Philippines. The flow of wealth proceeded from, and occurred within the Philippine territory, enjoying the protection accorded by the Philippine government.\n\nThe source of income is not necessarily determined by the location where the payment is disbursed or physically received, but rather by the location where the underlying business activities that produced the income actually took place. This principle is crucial in cases where business transactions occur in multiple stages across different taxing jurisdictions. In such instances, it becomes imperative to ascertain whether the particular stages occurring in the Philippines are so integral to the overall transaction that the business activity would not have been accomplished without them. If the income-generating activities in the Philippines are deemed essential, the income derived from these activities would be considered as sourced from the Philippines for tax purposes, irrespective of where the payment is ultimately received. This principle aligns with the benefits-received theory in taxation, which submits that the jurisdiction providing the essential services or factors for income generation should be entitled to tax that income.\n\nThe payment or income generated from service fees paid to the foreign company, including those made through the internet or other electronic means with the use of IT, is considered an inflow of economic benefits in favor of the foreign company.\n\nOn the other hand, the utilization of these services indicates that they offer benefits to the local company and are considered necessary to its business operations. The decision to avail these services is made with the intent of their relevance and importance to the local company's operations, reflecting sound judgment at the initial stage before engaging in such services. The outcomes or results of these services are subsequently put into practical use, applied, or utilized within the local country. aScITE\n\nQ4: What is the treatment of reimbursable or allocable expenses, especially for cross-border services between or among related parties?\n\nA4: The reimbursable or allocable expenses charged by a foreign corporation in the Philippines should contribute to the value or benefit received by a local company. It includes charges to the local company, with the affiliates abroad facilitating the payment to other affiliates or third parties for common incurred expenses.\n\nThe reduction of expenses for a foreign corporation can be considered as income because it represents a financial gain or savings for the company, it effectively increases the foreign corporation's net income or profit. This is because the company is spending less on its operations, resulting in additional funds that can be used for other purposes or retained as profit. Therefore, the reduction in expenses is viewed as a form of income for the foreign corporation.\n\nQ5: What would be the effect if there are no benefits derived from the cross-border transactions?\n\nA5: If there are no benefits derived by the Philippine company, then the payment becomes unnecessary for regular commercial activity and instead becomes a means of shifting profits to a foreign company. In other words, if the income is not generated through business activities conducted in the Philippines or does not provide any benefits to the local company, then, it may be seen as an attempt to evade taxes or manipulate profits by funneling them to a foreign entity.\n\nThe main point here is that the source of income should be determined by the location of the business activity that generates the income, rather than the location of the payout or where it is physically received. This perspective aligns with the principle that income should be taxed in the jurisdiction where the economic activity takes place and where the benefits of that activity are received.\n\nQ6: What do you mean by the phrase, \"the source of income should be determined by the location of the business activity that generates the income, rather than the location of the payout or where it is physically received\"?\n\nA6: This principle is known as the source-based taxation principle. The jurisdiction where the economic activity occurs should have the right to tax the income derived from that activity, regardless of where the payment is made or received. This ensures that income is taxed in the jurisdiction (Philippines) where the economic activity occurs and, thus, prevent tax avoidance. CAIHTE\n\nBy attributing income to the source of the business activity, countries can maintain their tax base and ensure that they can collect taxes on income generated within their jurisdiction. This principle also promotes fairness in taxation by avoiding situations where income is artificially shifted or allocated to jurisdictions with more favorable tax regimes.\n\nQ7: Are revenues generated from service fees paid to foreign companies or individuals, which are considered sources within the Philippines, also subject to VAT?\n\nA7: As propounded above, the source of income is not determined by where the payout is disbursed or physically received, but rather by where the business activity that generated the income took place. Even if the services are conducted or paid abroad, but there are activities to be performed in the Philippines so essential that the entire service transaction cannot be accomplished without them, then, the benefit-received theory applies. This means that the revenue-generating activity actually occurs within the Philippines. The income generated by the foreign company providing the services, which are considered sources within the Philippines, shall be subject to income tax and, consequently to final withholding tax.\n\nIn relation to VAT, it is important to note that Section 108(A), in relation to Section 114 of the NIRC of 1997, as amended, plays a significant role in determining the applicability of VAT on payments related to the sale or exchange of services and the use or lease of properties. This provision generally states that a twelve percent (12%) VAT is levied only if the services in question are performed within the Philippines.\n\nThe phrase \"sale or exchange of services\" encompasses a broad range of activities involving the provision of services in the Philippines to others in exchange for a fee, remuneration, or consideration. It includes any service performed within the country for the benefit of another party, whether it involves professional services, consulting, technical assistance, or any other form of service provision.\n\nThis includes income generated from service fees paid to foreign companies or individuals which is subject to VAT if the source of that income is within the Philippines. This means that even if the service provider is located outside the country, if the service is utilized, applied, executed or consumed for a recipient within the Philippines, the income payment for such service is considered sourced within the country and, thus, the VAT is applicable. Consequently, payment for such service shall be subject to final withholding VAT.\n\nAll internal revenue officers, employees and others concerned are hereby enjoined to give this Circular the widest dissemination and publicity as possible and strictly implement the provision thereof.\n\nThis Circular takes effect immediately.

Recognizing the importance of how the government collects taxes, this measure solidifies our commitment to our countrymen towards a dynamic and efficient tax administration which is responsive to the needs of our taxpayers, both individuals and those who are doing business, adapts to the changing times, and ultimately supports our recovery and growth objectives.\n\nThe EOPT Act will simplify tax filings for micro and small enterprises, allow most tax processes to be done online, shift to an invoice system to accelerate value-added tax (VAT) refunds, and create a special division in the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) for small and medium taxpayers.\n\nI thank the legislators of the 19th Congress, especially the leadership of both Houses and the Chairpersons of the Committees on Ways and Means, for this crucial and far-reaching Act.\n\nHowever, I cannot fully support certain provisions of the measure that tend to defeat its very objectives and would not only pose a substantial fiscal risk but also reduce the efficiency of tax administration in the long run.\n\nWe seek a tax system that would alleviate the tax burden of our citizenry and support lasting economic development. It is crucial, therefore, to maintain a fiscally disciplined policy that will ultimately be favorable for everyone.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT OF THE PHILIPPINES\n\nExempting micro-enterprises from the obligation to withhold taxes\n\nUnder Section 27 (2) of Article VI in the 1987 Constitution, the President may veto particular items in an appropriation, revenue, or tariff bill, but the veto shall not affect the item or items to which he does not object. This power covers items of appropriation, revenue, tariff, as well as inappropriate provisions in the measure. As such, I am constrained to veto Section 8 of the Act, which exempts micro-enterprises from the obligation to withhold taxes under Section 57 (b) of the Tax Code, to wit: CAIHTE\n\nSEC. 8. Section 57 of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended, is hereby further amended to read as follows:\n\n\"SEC. 57. Withholding of Tax at Source. \u2014\n\n(A) x x x\n\n(B) x x x\n\n(C) Tax-free Covenants Bonds. \u2014 x x x\n\nThe Department of Finance shall review, at least once every three (3) years, regulations and processes for the withholding of creditable tax under this Code, and direct the Bureau of Internal Revenue to amend rules and regulations for the same, should it be found during the review that the existing rules, regulations, and processes for the withholding of creditable tax under this Code adversely and materially impact the taxpayer: Provided, That micro taxpayers shall not be required to withhold taxes under Subsection (B) of this Section.\" [underscoring added]\n\nThe withholding tax system provides the benefit of collecting the seller's income taxes in advance. It also serves as an audit trail that mitigates under declaration of sales and income and underpayment of the corresponding value-added tax (VAT). If not vetoed, removing the withholding tax requirement for micro taxpayers will likely result in an understatement of tax obligations, negatively affecting the cash flow of the government.\n\nAssuming a 50 percent non-compliance rate (based on a 2018 World Bank study placing the country's personal income tax gap at 53.4 percent), the exemption of micro taxpayers will cost the government P40.4 billion in 2024 alone, equivalent to 0.15 percent of GDP. The total estimated forgone revenues for 2024 to 2028 is approximately P206.4 billion. Even at a modest non-compliance rate of 25 percent, the estimated average annual revenue loss will still be at P25.8 billion or a total of P103.2 billion from 2024 to 2028. The government cannot afford to lose such considerable revenue amid limited fiscal space at a time when the country needs government support to maintain its economic growth momentum. HTcADC\n\nThe aim of the EOPT Act to support micro and small enterprises must be fulfilled without impairing the government's tax administration capacities which are crucial to a responsive, effective, and sustainable implementation of fiscal policies. We have to strike a balance between providing relief to taxpayers, on the one hand, and maintaining administrative efficiency through the integrity of our tax collection and monitoring mechanisms, on the other. When we keep our reforms balanced and equitable, we ensure a resilient public financial management system that will facilitate stronger economic growth.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.)

On July 22, 2014, Revenue Memorandum Circular (RMC) No. 57-2014 was issued clarifying the use of Electronic Tax Remittance Advice (eTRA) System and mandated NGAs to enroll and use the eFPS in their filing of their applicable tax returns. It was further clarified that the eTRA System shall cover only the payment of withholding taxes and, therefore, does not cover other internal revenue taxes and penalties. However, it has been observed that certain NGAs, in their generation of Tax Remittance Advice (TRA) from the eTRA System, include penalties incurred for late filing and payment of withholding taxes.

As a supplement, Revenue Memorandum Order (RMO) No. 8-2003 identified Heads of Offices and Chief Accountants or other persons holding similar positions officially designated as such by the head of office as equally liable in the settlement of the said penalties.\n\nThe Revenue District Offices and concerned revenue offices of the Bureau are hereby directed to strictly monitor the NGAs' compliance in the remittance of their withholding taxes with the corresponding penalties incurred, if any, due to late filing and payment on the part of the NGAs. Likewise, the said RDOs shall undertake the reversal/correction in the Integrated Tax System-Collection and Bank Reconciliation (ITS-CBR)/Internal Revenue Integrated System-Collection Remittance and Reconciliation (IRIS-CRR) of penalties paid by NGAs thru eTRA. As such, payment of penalties using eTRA shall not be recognized as part of the RDO's eTRA collection until the said penalties has been collected and paid in cash thru the AABs or any payment facilities available in this Bureau.
