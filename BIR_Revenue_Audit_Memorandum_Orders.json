Brief Description of the Industry\n\nTelecommunications industry refers to communication businesses using regulated facilities that transmit data globally in words, voice, audio or video, across the globe. These include companies engaged in the service of broadcasting, telecommunications and cable providers which use copper cable, fiber or wireless technologies. Telecommunications can establish all forms of access points for a community and supports the deployment of powerful broadband networks to transport data and content. No other industry touches as many technology-related business sectors as telecommunications, which, by definition, encompasses not only the traditional areas of local and long-distance telephone service, but also advanced technology-based services including wireless communications, the Internet, fiber optics and satellites. Telecom is also intertwined with entertainment of all types.\n\nThe infrastructure component of the industry serves a vital role in the economic progress of the country. It provides convenient and efficient way of dealing with different business transactions, either locally or internationally. In only a few years, the industry has evolved from an inefficient public utility to a sector with an improved competition, providing consumers lower cost of communicating at home or abroad. Mobile phones have outnumbered landline phones in the Philippines. The Philippines, called the text message capital of the world, is the world leader in Short Messaging Service (SMS) with almost one billion daily messages. It has also emerged as one of the top off-shoring destinations for Information Technology Enabled Services (ITES).\n\nA. Terminologies Common to Telecommunications Industry\n\n1.

If the discrepancy is caused by faulty program logic, abnormal input data not considered in the computation, or incorrect record layout, modify and return the application as deemed necessary until such time that the CAATTs application proves to be responsive of the CAATTs objectives and tested to provide accurate results.\n\nTest run may be applied in any of the following:\n\n1. The whole data file, if there is only one file provided;\n\n2. One of many files provided, e.g., 1st month in a group of monthly files; and\n\n3. A subset of the data file, if the whole file is very large.\n\nH. Execute the applicable CAATTs' application (Note: Always keep track totals of record count and amounts to ensure that the data is processed completely. Document each CAATTs procedure while executing CAATTs, especially in repeated tests.)\n\n1. General Ledger\n\na. Obtain the transaction files that interface with the general ledger which should contain balances of each account together with transaction history.\n\nb. Understand and analyze coding structures of more complex general ledgers which have segmented account code for different purposes. Transaction data should include sources, dates, accounting month, transaction references and posting references. Sophisticated ledgers will hold each individual posting to allow inquiries, analyses and \"drill down.\"\n\nc. Generate ledger balances\n\ni. Summarize totals of entries generated by different sources/modules (e.g., purchase or sales ledger, journal vouchers, etc.);\n\nii. Foot (total) the balances to ensure they balance to zero. (Note: some ledgers include memo amounts which may need to be excluded); and\n\niii. Total (or summarize) transactions by account.\n\nc. Perform exception tests:\n\ni. Test for transactions with dates outside the taxable period under audit;\n\nii. Analyze per account and look for unusual debit/credit entries and consequent tax exposure; and\n\niii. Test for duplicate postings.\n\nd. Match and compare generated account groupings against balances per audited financial statements. Document unreconciled discrepancies, if any.\n\nSome general ledgers hold non-financial data, e.g., employee numbers, for use in management reporting and apportioning of costs. There will be some form of type code to identify these and should be excluded from the computation of the TB.\n\n2. Sales\n\nGenerally, a sales history file should be available, although on some systems, transactions are archived monthly. In this case, arrangement/s will have to be made to copy and save the file each month. The Append Database feature of the Audit Software can then be used to create an annual file (or whatever period is required) from the monthly files. It is worthwhile conducting some analysis of sales by appropriate headings and then using exception testing.\n\na. Analyze\n\ni. Extract the Official Receipts (OR) subject to VAT and compute VAT from the Billing Statement (BS) File and analyze sales by month, category or customer;\n\nii. Analyze Dealer Sales and compute withholding tax.\n\nb. Generate ledger balances of sales transactions\n\ni. Reproduce sales summarizes and posted totals;\n\nii. Test pricing discount computations on invoices; and\n\niii. Relate between items shipped and items booked as sales.\n\nc. Perform exception tests\n\ni. Extract all sales data for audit by customer, product, region, etc., and generate exceptions pertaining to sales price less than expected for product type or large discount given (transfer pricing and large credit notes);\n\nii. Filter the data on overseas calls, overseas SMS and roaming services and compute Overseas Communication Tax from the Statement of Accounts File;\n\niii. Extract and summarize unearned revenue and compare it with subscriber's balances;\n\niv. Extract Value Added Service (VAS) transactions of the Content Providers.\n\nd. Look for gaps and duplicates\n\ni. Test for missing Sales Invoice (SI)/Official Receipts (OR) numbers;\n\nii. Test for missing shipping/delivery receipts;\n\niii. Test for duplicate invoices (either duplicate invoice number, shipping order number or customer and detail/amount); and\n\ne. Match and compare\n\ni. Match Cash Receipts Journal to receipts posted to the Accounts Receivable Ledger for credit transactions. Identify any unmatched records;\n\nii. Compute interconnection revenues and interconnection payables from the Settlement Transaction file and check offsetting;\n\niii. Review customer deposits;\n\niv. Recognized expired cards as income;\n\nv. Compare the number or items listed on the daily sales report with the number of items billed on the invoices.\n\n3. Inventory\n\nInventory can vary in volume and cost within organizations. Where inventory is a significant item, audit testing is used to provide assurance on existence, completeness (cut-off) and valuation.\n\na. Analyze and summarize\n\ni. Analyze high value transactions (e.g., input tax verification);\n\nii. Summarize stock on-hand by group, location, type, etc.; and\n\niii. Summarize products by group, location, type, etc.\n\nb. Generate ledger balances relative to Inventory\n\ni. Generate report on products in order of profitability; and\n\nii. Test clerical accuracy of totals and extensions.\n\nc. Perform exception tests\n\ni. Identify stock acquired from associated companies; and\n\nii.

Test for duplicate item numbers or descriptions; and\n\nii. Test hash totals.\n\ne. Match and compare\n\ni. Compare cost to selling price to look for valuation discrepancies.\n\n4. Payroll\n\nPayroll auditing is an excellent application of the Audit Software. The main objective is to check validity and accuracy by testing existence of employee, correctness of pay and accuracy of withholding taxes made. There are many regulations and taxes associated with payroll and compliance therewith can be checked. Privacy concerns/confidentiality may limit verification but the following common tests may be applied:\n\na. Analyze and summarize\n\ni. Analyze and summarize costs for special pay, overtime, premium, etc.; and\n\nii. Summarize payroll distribution for reconciliation to general ledger.\n\nb. Generate ledger balances of payroll-related accounts\n\niii.      Total gross pay, net pay, deductions and any other value fields;\n\niv. Check computation of gross pay;\n\nv. Check computation of taxable/non-taxable pay;\n\nvi. Classify employees by position;\n\nvii. Classify and summarize employees' pay by cost center and compare against MCIT;\n\nviii. Re-compute withholding taxes and compare against remittances; and\n\nix. Compare payroll master file with payroll list or Alpha List.\n\nc. Perform Exception Tests\n\ni. Extract all employees not included in the employee Masterfile; and\n\nii. Extract all employees with missing Tax Identification Number (TIN).\n\nd. Look for gaps and duplicates\n\niii.  Test for duplicate employee numbers (ghost employees); and\n\niv. Test hash totals.\n\n5. Fixed Assets\n\nFixed Asset registers vary in the detail of information and volume of records. In organizations with significant volumes of plant and machinery, the Audit Software can be used to scan for problem items.\n\na. Analyze\n\ni. Provide a total of depreciated assets still in use.\n\nii. Analyze components of AUC (Asset Under Construction); and\n\niii. Check transfer of AUC to Fixed Assets and re-compute asset life/depreciation expense against amounts posted in general ledger.\n\nb. Generate ledger balances on Fixed Assets related accounts.\n\ni.

Prove totals of additions and disposals and recalculate profits or losses on disposal; and\n\niv. Segregate impairment losses.\n\nc. Perform exception tests\n\ni. Identify items with unusual movements in Net Book Value (e.g., appraisal increment charged to depreciation);\n\nii. Supply details where the depreciation rate is unusual;\n\niii. Test for dates in the appropriate period;\n\niv. Identify assets transferred or acquired from group companies;\n\nv. Identify items with zero or negative cost and items where depreciation exceeds cost;\n\nvi. Identify items where description does not match coding;\n\nvii. Extract assets with useful lives or depreciation rates beyond set norms;\n\nviii. Identify fully depreciated items and assets higher than replacement costs;\n\nix. Analyze changes in capital asset accounts and verify existence of any sale, exchange or disposition of fixed or capital assets during the year under audit; and\n\nx.

Match and compare\n\nii. [n] Compare book and tax depreciation and indicate variances; and\n\niii. Compare useful lives of assets by category.\n\n6. Accounts Receivable (AR)\n\nTests of AR are performed to establish existence, completeness and valuation. Items of particular concern are old unpaid invoices, unmatched cash and large balances. These can all be picked up with exception tests.\n\na. Analyze and summarize\n\ni. Profile accounts using stratification to identify large accounts and the proportion of value in the larger items; and\n\nii. Generate summarizes by customer, invoice, amounts, products, etc.\n\nb. Generate ledger balances of AR-related accounts\n\ni. Total the file. Separate debits and credits;\n\nii. Check transaction totals to the balance on each account; and\n\niii. Show variances between delivery documents and invoices.\n\nc. Perform exception tests\n\ni. Report credit balances;\n\nii. Identify unmatched cash or credits;\n\niii. Test for items with shipping dates or number outside the expected ranges;\n\niv. Identify payments of some accounts or invoices;\n\nv. Identify invalid transaction types; and\n\nvi. Identify high value credit notes, balances, and invoices.\n\nd. Look for gaps and duplicates\n\ni. Identify for duplicate invoices, credit notes or receipts; and\n\nii. Report gaps in sequences of invoices and credit notes generated.\n\n7. Accounts Payable (AP)\n\nIt is important to establish that liabilities are neither understated nor overstated. Current standards also look for potential fraudulent activities in the accounting systems.\n\nMany accounts payable tests also relate to supplier master file details. This often resides on a different file of the detailed ledger items. Apply the common test as follows:\n\na. Analyze and summarize\n\ni. Reconcile check register to disbursements by vendor invoice; and\n\nii. Summarize invoices by supplier to prove individual balances.\n\nb. Generate ledger balances of AP-related accounts.\n\ni. Total the file. Separate debit and credit balances.\n\nc. Perform exception tests\n\ni. Identify debit balances;\n\nii. Identify unusual stand-out data; and\n\niii. Identify and total liabilities for goods received and not yet invoiced.\n\nd. Look for gaps and duplicates\n\ni. Test for duplicate payments/invoices.\n\ne. Match and compare\n\ni. Match subsequent period payments against period and balances to identify unmatched payments:\n\n\u2022 Compare invoices posted against purchase order amounts; and\n\n\u2022 Compare recurring monthly expenses to paid invoices.\n\nI. Generate a report on the items with discrepancies/audit findings. Investigate the reasons for the discrepancies/findings and resolve the issues with the taxpayer. For example, the RO may obtain copies of supporting documents (e.g., sales invoices, official receipts, delivery receipt, sales reports, collection reports, etc.) relating to the exceptions; and\n\nMoreover, despite the above enumerations, the RO is not precluded from applying other techniques which are deemed necessary in a particular case. The RO can use the same techniques in auditing other books and/or modules of the system such as General Journal, Purchase Journal, Cash Receipt Journal, Cash Disbursement Journal, and other special journals/subsidiary ledgers. Sample of Financial Statements in case of auditing complete CAS can also be viewed by the RO for checking the transaction trail.\n\nVII. Third Party Verification\n\nA. Regulatory Agencies Involved\n\n1. National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) \u2014 the government through NTC regulates the telecommunications industry.\n\nThere are two stages before a firm can enter into the regulated segments of the industry. The first step requires a congressional franchise to operate a telecommunications service in all or some parts of the country. The second stage involves application for Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity (CPCN) or a Provisional Authority (PA) issued by NTC, which requires the carriers to prove that they are technically and financially able to execute the operations and that a significant demand exists. The PA contains the description of the service, specific rate to be charged for the service and the regulations.\n\n2. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)\n\n3. Board of Investments (BOI)\n\n4. National Privacy Commission (NPC)\n\n5. Cybercrime Investigation and Coordinating Center (CICC)\n\nB. Other Taxpayers\n\n1.

BACKGROUND\n\nThe audit of a tax return is a tool utilized by the Bureau to determine the degree of taxpayer's compliance with existing laws, rules and regulations pursuant to Section 6 of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC), as amended by Republic Act (RA) No. 10963 or the \"Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion (TRAIN).\" By conducting a quality audit of taxpayers' books of accounts and other financial records in sufficient depth, the correctness and validity of entries therein and the propriety of taxpayers' application of tax laws, rules and regulations can be ascertained.\n\nII. OBJECTIVES\n\nThis Order is issued to provide Revenue Officers (ROs) and officials with an updated Value-Added Tax (VAT) Manual (Annex A) which contains basic procedures and techniques in the conduct of audit of VAT liabilities, as well as the minimum documentary requirements that shall be attached by the RO on his audit report.\n\nIII. REPEALING CLAUSE\n\nAll other revenue issuances inconsistent herewith are hereby modified or repealed accordingly.\n\nIV. EFFECTIVITY\n\nThis Order shall take effect immediately.\n\n(SGD.) CAESAR R.

INTRODUCTION\n\nThe updated Value-Added Tax (VAT) Audit Manual has been prepared for all Revenue Officers (ROs) who conduct field examination of VAT returns to ensure the performance of a quality audit. The manual aims to equip the users with the necessary knowledge, relevant auditing skills and confidence in the conduct of the audit so that the examination of internal revenue tax returns, particularly VAT returns, can be competently undertaken.\n\nThe Manual contains updated basic auditing procedures and techniques in the examination of the taxpayers' VAT liabilities. This manual does not include the policies, procedures and verification of claims for VAT credit/refund which are provided in a separate revenue issuance.\n\nThe RO is advised to focus on risk areas where there are potential findings of deficiency taxes arising from imposition of output tax on taxable sales and transactions, as well as disallowance of input taxes. However, he is not precluded from performing such other auditing procedures and techniques deemed necessary based on the circumstances prevailing in each particular case.\n\nII. AUDIT OF VALUE-ADDED TAX LIABILITIES\n\nA. Preliminary Approach to Investigation\n\nPrior to actual field investigation, the RO should:\n\n1. Accomplish the General VAT Audit Plan per Annex A-1 through verification of some of the required information from the Bureau's information system, such as the following:\n\na. Number of branches and facilities with corresponding locations;\n\nb. Tax types duly registered for the branches and facilities;\n\nc. Registered books of accounts for the principal office and branches;\n\nd. The issued Authority to Print (ATP) for accountable forms required for principal invoices/official receipts and for supplementary commercial documents including provisional receipts, acknowledgment receipts, delivery receipts, debit memos and credit memos, etc.;\n\ne. Permit to use loose-leaf invoices/receipts/books of accounts;\n\nf. Approved Computerized Accounting System (CAS) and Computerized Books of Accounts (CBA) or components thereof or Acknowledgement Certificate (AC); and\n\ng. Any Letter of Authority/Tax Verification Notice issued to the taxpayer for the audit of his/its VAT liability or all internal revenue tax liabilities covering the same period.\n\n2. Perform analytical procedures based on the tax and information returns including financial statements filed in the Bureau, research through the Internet and/or through other external sources.\n\n3. Familiarize with the business of the taxpayer and determine the economic activity in which he/it is engaged in, whether sale of goods, properties, services and other lines of business aside from the principal undertaking, based on the VAT returns, financial statements, as well as through other sources within the Bureau and through on-line facilities. Refer to the available audit manual for the conduct of audit applicable to the taxpayer's industry, in order to determine the necessary documents that shall be asked from the auditee.\n\n4. Verify the following from the Bureau's information system:\n\na. Filed Returns and Payments per Tax Type;\n\nb. Third Party Information provided by the Audit Information, Tax Exemptions and Incentives Division (AITEID) of the National Office;\n\nc. eSales and eACCREG reports;\n\nd. Electronic data submitted by taxpayers \u2014 Summary List of Sales (SLS), Summary List of Purchases (SLP), Summary List of Importation (SLI), Monthly Alphalist (MAP), Summary Alphalist of Withholding Tax (SAWT);\n\ne. Regulations, Circulars and Rulings including Decisions of the Supreme Court and Court of Tax Appeals; and\n\nf. Details of Authority to Print (ATP) or Computerized Accounting System (CAS)/POS Permits issued and registered books of accounts.\n\n5. Study the accounting methods and peculiarities in the industry group where the taxpayer belongs.\n\n6. Analyze the financial statements and notes to financial statements to determine the accounting method of sales and income recognition, accounting period, input tax existence in the asset account, sources of input taxes, related-party transactions including due to/from accounts and other relevant information.\n\n7. Examine the quarterly VAT returns and monthly VAT declarations filed.\n\na. Verify if all the required information is completely and properly reflected therein.\n\nb. Check the mathematical accuracy of the computations presented.\n\nc. Determine whether the declaration/return was filed and the appropriate tax due was paid at the time required by law or rules and regulations.\n\nd. Ascertain if a Tax Debit Memo (TDM) has been issued by the appropriate office authorizing the application of Tax Credit Certificate (TCC) against VAT liability, if applicable.\n\n8. Verify VAT payments through the BIR's Information System and in case the payments are not posted in the taxpayer's ledger, verify the payments from the Batch Control Sheet (BCS) and other manual records maintained by the investigating office. If the VAT returns in the BCS has attached proof of payment, e.g., bank deposit slip, debit memo or any proof of payment issued by the Authorized Agent Bank/Revenue Collection Officer), verify the reason why the payments were not posted.\n\nTake note of the discrepancy in amounts between what was posted in the BIR's Information System and the attached proof of payment, or between the details of payment shown in the VAT returns as against the bank validation. This discrepancy must be further verified during audit proper.\n\n9. Refer to the report of the audit of the VAT liabilities of the taxpayer for the immediately preceding period to be aware of the deficiencies noted that may also be relevant in the audit of the current period, if there is any.\n\n10. Compare the sales and purchases with their corresponding output and input taxes declared against the industry's benchmark under the benchmarking program pursuant to RMO No. 5-2012, if applicable.\n\n11. Recapitulate and tally the entries in the VAT returns filed during the period covered by the investigation to determine the aggregate sales and purchases, output and input taxes. Ascertain whether the ending balances of excess input tax from the preceding period was properly carried-over to the current period (the covered period of audit) and the ending balance of the current period was carried over to the succeeding.\n\n12. Identify significant changes in sales and purchases and VAT payments during the period under audit as compared to the immediately preceding period. Take note of unusual fluctuations in the quarterly sales and/or purchases.\n\n13. Prepare checklist of documentary requirements to be attached to the electronic Letter of Authority (eLA), as well as the books of accounts and accounting records to be examined per Annex A-2 hereof.\n\nB. General Approach to Field Investigation\n\n1. Serve to the taxpayer the original copy of the eLA, together with the checklist of requirements. Observe and strictly comply with the proper service of eLA prescribed in item number 23 of RMO No. 19-2015 and clarified in Revenue Memorandum Circular (RMC) No. 110-2020.\n\n2. Request for the books of accounts and other relevant accounting records, as necessary, to determine proper recording and recognition of sales and output tax, purchases and expenses with input tax, and other transactions that could give rise to VAT liabilities.\n\n3. Conduct ocular inspection of the taxpayer's premises such as production plant, sales outlets and/or storage facilities. Relate the equipment in use, the product lines being carried, and the estimated value of the business being handled with the amount of sales declared in the VAT returns. Observe the movement of transactions based on cash inflows and outflows as this could not be manifested in the capital investment.\n\n4. Conduct interview with responsible and authorized finance, accounting, sales and other personnel to further familiarize with business operations related to sales and purchases.\n\nC. Audit of Sales and Output Tax\n\n1. Sales of Goods, Properties, and Services \u2014 In General\n\na. Compare each category and amount of sales per monthly VAT declarations, quarterly VAT returns, SLS and audited financial statements with the classification and amount of sales per general ledger and sales journal.\n\nb. Review the composition of the sales account in the journals and ledgers and ascertain that:\n\nb.1. Only those transactions which are specifically exempted under Sec. 109 of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997 (Tax Code), as amended and further amended by \"Corporate Recovery and Tax Incentives for Enterprises Act\" (CREATE) as implemented under Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 4-2021, are treated as exempt sales.\n\nb.2. \"Deemed\" sales of goods as mentioned under Section 106 (B) of the Tax Code, as amended, are recorded as taxable transactions, to wit:\n\nb.2.1. Transfer, use or consumption not in the course of business of goods, properties or services originally intended for sale or for use in the course of business. Transfer of goods, properties or services not in the course of business can take place when a VAT-registered person withdraws goods or avail of services from the business and intended for other use or purposes;\n\nb.2.2. Distribution or transfer to shareholders or investors as share in the profits of the VAT-registered person or to creditors in payment of debt or obligation;\n\nb.2.3. Consignment of goods if actual sale is not made within 60 days following the date when such goods were consigned. (Consigned goods returned by the consignee within the 60-day period are not deemed sold). If there is any \"Consignment Agreement,\" check the agreed terms; and\n\nb.2.4. Retirement from or cessation of business or death of an individual with respect to inventories of taxable goods existing as of such retirement or cessation. The following circumstances shall, among others, give rise to transactions \"deemed sale.\"\n\ni. Change of ownership of the business \u2014 There is a change in the ownership of the business when a single proprietorship incorporates or the proprietor of a single proprietorship sells his entire business;\n\nii. Dissolution of a partnership other than a general professional partnership and creation of a new partnership which takes over the business; and\n\niii. Death of an individual who is a VAT-registered person when the heirs of the decedent shall continue to operate the business.\n\nb.3. Goods or properties originally intended for sale or use in business and capital goods which are existing as of the occurrence of the following, are subject to output tax under Section 106 (C) of the Tax Code, as amended:\n\nb.3.1. Change of business activity from VAT-taxable status to VAT-exempt status;\n\nb.3.2. Approval of a request for cancellation of registration due to reversion to exempt status;\n\nb.3.3. Approval of a request for change from VAT to non-VAT status in the registration due to a desire to revert to exempt status after the lapse of 3 years from the time of registration by a person who voluntarily registered despite being exempt under Section 109 of the Tax Code, as amended; and\n\nb.3.4. Approval of a request for change from VAT to non-VAT status in the registration of one who commenced business with the expectation of gross sales or receipts exceeding P3,000,000.00 but failed to exceed this amount during the first twelve months of operation.\n\nHence, taxpayers are required to file the quarterly VAT return covering the period when the change of status transpired and pay the corresponding VAT due on inventories including capital goods disposed of or existing thereon, as provided under RMC No. 39-2018.\n\nc. Check the accuracy of the details in the schedule/Sales Journal against the sales invoices/official receipts issued for all types of sale and for zero-rated sales of goods and/or services.\n\nd. Match the amounts of sales subject to 0% VAT, 12% VAT and VAT-exempt sales per schedule/Sales Journal with those reflected in the VAT returns and SLS. Determine if the amount of output tax reflected has been correctly computed.\n\ne. Verify totals of sales subject to 0% VAT, 12% VAT and VAT-exempt sales as a basis for allocation of input taxes not directly identifiable with each category of sales, where applicable.\n\nf. Verify if there are any foreign loans or foreign transactions outside the regular course of business that will give rise to assessment of output tax.\n\ng. Test the accuracy of the amount in sales account against the total per source documents, e.g., sales invoices, official receipts, credit and debit memos or delivery receipts.\n\nh. Determine compliance with the invoicing requirements and procedures by:\n\nh.1. Verifying the validity of the Authority to Print (ATP) of the sales invoices/official receipts or approved Permit to Use Computerized Accounting System issued by the office where the taxpayer is registered; and\n\nh.2. Check whether the issued sales invoices/official receipts are in accordance with Section 113 (B) and 237 of the Tax Code, as amended, and RMO No. 12-2013 and RR 16-2018;\n\nh.3. Assess penalty for any violation of Section 237 of the Tax Code in relation with Section 113 (B). Impose compromise penalty under RMO No. 7-2015.\n\ni. Ensure that all issued principal sales invoices/official receipts and supplementary documents as sources of income are accounted for, including those issued by branches. Take down any break in the sequence of the serial numbers of issued invoices and ask the taxpayer to account for the missing numbers. In case of cancellation, look for the original copy and note in the working papers the cancelled invoices, as well as those which are unaccounted.\n\nDetermine if the unaccounted invoices pertain to local sales which should be subject to output tax.\n\nj. Be alert if the taxpayer is practicing the following schemes and report to the appropriate office for criminal investigation:\n\nj.1. use of double or multiple set of invoices/receipts bearing identical serial numbers\n\nj.2. unregistered invoices/receipts\n\nj.3. non-issuance of official receipts or invoices\n\nj.4. invoices/receipts not within the validity period\n\nj.5. use of supplemental or provisional invoices without issuing the corresponding principal invoices/receipts\n\nj.6. use of unregistered CRMs/POS machine\n\nj.7. use of computer-generated/loose-leaf invoices/receipts without the issued BIR permits.\n\nk. Verify if the transactions covered by \"Statement of Account\" Billing Statements, \"Delivery Receipt,\" \"Collection Receipts\" Purchase Orders', Provisional Receipts', Acknowledgement Receipts, Job Orders Debit/Credit Notes\" and other similar documents issued to their customers has corresponding principal invoices/official receipts and as recorded as sales. These supplemental documents should include the phase \u2014 \"THIS DOCUMENT IS NOT VALID FOR CLAIM OF INPUT TAX\" on bold letters and shall be conspicuously printed at the face of the said document per RMO 12-2013.\n\nThe mere issuance of these documents without the corresponding sales invoice is a violation of the bookkeeping regulations and an indication of unrecorded sales.\n\nl. When verifying a delivery receipt, ascertain whether it covers a consummated sale or consigned sale. Consignment should be duly supported by a contract between the consignor and the consignee.\n\nm. If the taxpayer is engaged in mixed transactions (subject to VAT, zero rated and exempt), the invoice or receipt shall clearly indicate the breakdown of the VAT sale with VAT amount, zero-rated sales and exempt sales component.\n\nAny person whose sale of goods, properties or services which are otherwise not subject to VAT but who issues a VAT invoice or receipt therefore shall, in addition to his liability to percentage tax, if any, and applicable penalties, be liable to VAT without benefit of any input tax credit pursuant to Section 4.113-4 of RR No. 16-2005, as amended by RR No. 13-2018.\n\nn. Verify sales contracts, marketing agreements, consignment terms and other sales related documents for possible under-declaration.\n\no. Scrutinize miscellaneous and other income accounts and due to/from accounts to ascertain if such accounts are subject to VAT.\n\np. Examine the cash receipts per book and official receipts and other supplementary receipts issued to uncover any collection which may not have been included in the taxable sale.\n\nq. Be resourceful in discovering under-declaration of sales by evaluating abnormal levels of inventories, sales, purchases, accounts receivables, including manipulation of inter-branch transactions, among others, which may suggest instances of under-declaration.\n\nr. Validate findings/discrepancies noted by examining details of transactions reflected in the books of accounts against certifications of purchases from selected buyers with Discrepancy Notices generated from the matching of pre-processed data (Summary List of Sales/Summary List of Purchases) against the VAT returns of the taxpayers under audit.\n\ns. Reconcile the sales or receipts reported per VAT returns with the amount of sales/receipts subjected to withholding tax reflected in the withholding tax certificate submitted by customers to the BIR, if applicable. Match and reconcile the creditable taxes availed appearing in the annual income tax returns.\n\nt. Scrutinize the reasonableness of the level of inventory vis-\u00e0-vis the sales reported in the VAT returns, income tax return and financial statements.\n\nu. Analyze all the accounts and entries affecting total sales, particularly cash accounts, accounts and/or notes receivable, collections from receivables, sales discounts and sales returns, bad debts written off and other relevant accounts. Apply the pro-forma computation to arrive at the total sale of goods in Annexes A-3 to A-5, where applicable.\n\nv. In auditing sale of services, analyze other accounts such as advances, retention receivables, mobilization fees and other related accounts. [See pro-forma computations on Annex A-6.]\n\nw. Identify instances where the gross selling price of goods or properties are being unreasonably lower than the actual market value, then evaluate if there are instances of schemes for transfer pricing and make the necessary adjustments in the sales value thereof, where applicable. For sale of real properties, the taxable base for the imposition of VAT is the gross selling price or fair market value whichever is higher pursuant to the provision if Section 4.106-4 or Revenue Regulations No. 16-2005.\n\nx. If the accounting records are unreliable, the following may be performed:\n\nx.1. Look into gate passes, delivery receipts, sales order slips, purchase order registers and other records used by the taxpayer in his/its day-to-day transactions.\n\nx.2. In the absence of pre-processed data on Summary of Sales and Purchases in the National Office, request for a certification from its major customers and suppliers as to their purchases and sales, respectively, to the taxpayer.\n\nx.3. Consider a covert or overt surveillance as required by the circumstances, if applicable.\n\ny. If the selling price is unreasonably lower than the actual market value, identify if there are instances of schemes of transfer pricing.\n\nz. Account for deductions from sales such as:\n\nz.1 Section 106 D of the Tax Code clearly states the conditions for a discount to be a valid VAT deduction, namely:\n\ni. Discount is indicated in the invoice/receipt at the time of sale,\n\nii. Discount does not depend upon the happening of a future event, and\n\niii. Discount is granted within the same quarter it was given.\n\nz.2 Sales returns and allowances for which proper credit or refund was made during the month or quarter to the buyer for sales previously recorded as taxable sales.\n\naa. For audit of real estate developers, compare the following information required under RMC 57-2014 and with information stated in the tax returns:\n\naa.1 Annex B \u2014 Inventory of Saleable Units with Corresponding Cost per Project.\n\naa.2 Annex B-1 \u2014 Schedule of Inventory of Saleable Units per Project the Corresponding Trade Accounts Receivable Reconciliation.\n\nbb. For audit of insurance companies, secure a copy of the Insurance Commission (IC) Report required under RR 21-02 and compare information stated therein with the tax returns.\n\n2. Zero-Rated Sales of Goods and Services\n\na. Determine whether sales declared as zero-rated actually emanate from export sales and other transactions that may qualify as zero-rated in accordance with Section 106 (2) of the Tax Code, as amended, in relation to RR No. 16-2005, as amended by RR Nos. 4-2007 and 13-2018.\n\nb. For actual export sales of goods, obtain schedule/Sales Journal with the following information and vouch supporting documents:\n\nb.1. Date of Export\n\nb.2. Sales Invoice Number\n\nb.3. Name of Customer/Buyer\n\nb.4. Airway Bill/Bill of Lading No.\n\nb.5. Shipment Date\n\nb.6. Amount of Sales in Foreign Currency and in Pesos\n\nb.7. Amount of Foreign Currency Remitted\n\nb.8. Conversion Rate\n\nb.9. Amount of Remittance in Pesos\n\nb.10. Date of Remittance\n\nb.11. Accredited Bank\n\nb.12. Bank Credit Memo Number/Documentary Proof of Remittance\n\nb.13. Discrepancy between Amount of Sales in Foreign Currency per Sales Invoice and Amount of Remittance in Foreign Currency\n\nb.14. Forex Gain or Loss\n\nb.15. Remarks\n\nc. For zero-rated sale of services, obtain schedule with the following information:\n\nc.1. Date of Transaction\n\nc.2. Official Receipt (OR) Number and Date of OR\n\nc.3. Name of Customer/Contractee\n\nc.4. Amount of Sales in Foreign Currency\n\nc.5. Amount of Foreign Currency Remitted\n\nc.6. Conversion Rate\n\nc.7. Amount of Remittance in Pesos\n\nc.8. Date of Remittance\n\nc.9. Accredited Bank\n\nc.10. Proof of Remittances (Bank Credit Memo, etc.)\n\nc.11. Discrepancy Between Amount of Sales in Foreign Currency per Official Receipts and Amount of Remittance in Foreign Currency\n\nc.12. Forex Gain or Loss\n\nc.13. Remarks\n\nd. Review commercial invoices/receipts, bills of lading or airway bills, export declaration permit, packing lists, inward letters of credit, landing certificates and other related commercial documents and match with the sales invoices issued.\n\ne. Examine service contracts, job orders and related documents for zero-rated sales of services and determine if the implementation and execution of services are outside the Philippines, which will qualify as zero rated sales.\n\nf. Ascertain if the proceeds from zero-rated sales were paid for in acceptable foreign currency and accounted for in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) by verifying the supporting bank credit memo, bank certifications, taxpayers' passbook or any document issued by the bank to prove the inward remittance of foreign currency from the zero-rated sales.\n\ng. In case of constructive remittance such as offsetting arrangement, secure copy of the following:\n\ng.1. Board resolution as to offsetting arrangement;\n\ng.2. Memorandum of agreement containing terms of payment;\n\ng.3. Intercompany debit or credit memo or any document on the amount constructively remitted under the offsetting arrangement; and/or\n\ng.4. Other loan documents or proofs of company advances.\n\nIf the amount of inward remittance on the constructive remittance is less than the total zero-rated sales, the discrepancy shall be construed as unremitted export sales. Hence, the input tax pertaining to the discrepancy shall be deducted from the allowable input tax (net of disallowances) using the following formula:\n\n\u2022 For Companies with Purely Zero-Rated Sales\n\nUnremitted Export Sales\n\nX\n\nAllowable Input Tax\n\n=\n\nInput Tax Allocable to Unremitted/Unaccounted Export Sales\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\n\nTotal Zero-rated Sales\n\n\u2022 For Companies with Mixed Transactions\n\nUnremitted Export Sales\n\nX\n\nAllowable Input Tax\n\n=\n\nInput Tax Allocable to Unremitted/Unaccounted Export Sales\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\n\nTotal Sales\n(Zero-rated + Taxable + Exempt)\n\n\u2022 Computation of allowable input tax:\n\nTotal available input tax per returns\n\nPxxx\n\nLess: Disallowed input tax per audit\n\nxxx\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\n\nAllowable input tax per audit\n\nPxxx\n\n=====\n\nh. For effectively zero rated transactions, secure copy of duly approved application for zero rating. Without an approved application, the transaction otherwise entitled to zero-rating shall be considered exempt.\n\nBased on the CREATE law under Revenue Regulations 9-2021, 12% VAT is imposed on transactions covered under Sec. 106 (A) (A) (2) (a) subparagraphs 3, 4, 5 & Sec. 108 (B) subparagraphs (1) and (5). Implementation of this regulation is deferred under Revenue Regulations 15-2021.\n\n3. VAT-Exempt Transactions\n\na. Secure a copy of the BIR ruling in relation to the taxpayer's exemption and verify its authenticity from the issuing office.\n\nb. Check whether the current line of business of the company matches the main line of business indicated in its Certificate of Registration and Certificate of Exemption.\n\nc. Identify if all the transactions can be classified as VAT-exempt as enumerated under Section 109 of the Tax Code, as amended, with particular emphasis on amendments under the TRAIN Law and CREATE Law.\n\nd. Ascertain compliance on invoicing requirements for VAT-exempt entities.\n\n4. Related-Party Transactions\n\na. Review the disclosures in the notes to financial statements to determine if there are related-party transactions.\n\nb. Analyze movements of inter-related company accounts and verify documents involving related-party transactions to ascertain whether there are transactions that are subject to VAT such as but not limited to transfers of inventories, inter-company billings of services, reimbursements-on-cost basis, royalties, management fees and service fees paid to non-resident foreign affiliates subject to final withholding VAT.\n\nc. When auditing inter-related parties with cross-border or inter-related parties under two-tax regime, identify instances where the gross selling price of goods or properties are being unreasonably lower than the actual market value, then evaluate if there are instances of schemes for transfer pricing and make the necessary adjustments in the sales value thereof, where applicable.\n\nD. Audit of Purchases and Input Tax\n\n1. Compare the nature and amount of purchases per VAT returns, financial statements and general ledger. Reconcile the amount of each category of purchases per VAT declarations and returns with the amount of purchases per purchase journal. Check if all the information required are recorded likewise in the subsidiary purchase journal. Determine any discrepancy and request for reconciliation of the discrepancy.\n\n2. Obtain Summary of Purchases/Purchase Journal with the following information:\n\na. Date of transaction\n\nb. Name of Payee\n\nc. TIN of Payee\n\nd. Sales Invoice No./Official Receipt No.\n\ne. Check number (if applicable)\n\nf. Gross taxable purchases\n\ng. Exempt purchases\n\nh. Zero-rated purchases\n\ni. Input tax\n\n3. Check the correctness and completeness of the submitted schedule of purchases through the following procedures:\n\na. Verify the accuracy of the details in the schedule against the suppliers'/sellers' sales invoices, official receipts, deeds of sale and other documents in support of the purchase of goods/properties and services.\n\nb. Check the correctness of the input tax shown separately on the sales invoice official/receipt and match with the amount per schedule.\n\nc. Analyze and compare the summary of purchases with entries appearing in the subsidiary purchase journals, purchase journal, purchase invoices and other source documents.\n\n4. Ascertain that the recorded amount of the purchase of goods, properties or services are net of VAT.\n\n5. Verify whether the taxpayer filed amended returns or declarations covering the period under audit to preclude any possibility that the audit findings will still include transactions which were already reflected by the taxpayer in the amended returns.\n\n6. Reconcile the amounts of input tax claimed in the VAT return for the portion carried over from previous quarters and the balance carried to succeeding quarters with the amounts recorded in the books of accounts.\n\nIn case there are discrepancies between these records, trace the sources of discrepancies against underlying documents to detect any possible deficiency tax assessment.\n\n7. Ascertain that input tax credit is not recognized from the following:\n\na. Purchases from non-VAT and/or exempt persons;\n\nb. Effectively zero rated purchases;\n\nc. Purchases from VAT persons, which are personal in nature or not made in the course of trade or business; and\n\nd. Purchases of tax-exempt goods, properties or services from VAT-registered persons although covered by VAT invoices or receipts.\n\n8. Determine compliance with the substantiation requirements for claims of input tax credit.\n\na. For domestic purchases of goods, properties and services in the course of trade or business, these must be supported by VAT invoices and/or official receipts, showing the information required in Secs. 113 (B) and 237 of the Tax Code, as amended.\n\nA cash register machine tape shall constitute valid proof of input tax credit only if it shows the information required under the aforementioned issuances, as implemented in Section 4.110.8 (4) of RR No. 16-2005, and Section 2 of RR No. 16-2018.\n\nb. Input tax on purchases of real property should be supported by a copy of the public instrument (i.e., deed of absolute sale, deed of conditional sale, contract/agreement to sell) together with the VAT invoice and/or official receipt issued by the seller, as implemented in Section 4.110-8 (a) (3) of RR No. 16-2005.\n\n9. For purchase of real property and other items on instalment basis, take note that:\n\na. VAT official receipts issued for amortization (installment) payments, subsequent to initial payments on \"Deferred Payment Basis (DPB),\" shall not generate input tax credit. Under DPB where initial payment exceeds 25% of the gross selling price, the transaction shall be treated as cash sale which makes the entire selling price taxable in the month of sale.\n\nb. In accordance with Section 4.106.3 paragraph 2 of RR No. 16-2005, for sale of real property on installment plan, the computation of VAT shall be based on the installment payments, including interests and other penalties for late payment, actually or constructively received by the seller.\n\n10. Examine supporting documents for input tax on importation, particularly the official receipts issued by the Bureau of Customs (BOC) including the supporting Import Entry and Internal Revenue Declarations (IERD) and/or Single Administrative Document (SAD), Statement of Settlement of Duties and Taxes (SSDT).\n\n11. Verify actual existence of goods or properties that generate input tax credits whenever practicable and ascertain whether the same are actually used in the course of business.\n\n12. Check the correctness of the input tax shown separately on the invoice/receipt. Input tax not separately reflected on the invoice cannot be allowed as a deduction from the corresponding output tax.\n\n13. For purchases of goods, check the subsequent payment of the items purchased and determine if there are discounts granted, returns and allowances. Input tax credit should be reduced by the VAT portion of the said adjustment to the purchase.\n\n14. If a VAT-registered person is also engaged in exempt activities, determine the direct attribution of purchased goods, properties or services to taxable and exempt transactions. If purchases are directly attributable to exempt transactions, any claim for input tax credit thereof shall be disallowed. However, if the input taxes paid for purchases of goods, properties or services could not be directly attributable to either activity, the same shall be allocated between the taxable operation and non-taxable operation using the computation shown in Annex A-7. The amount allocated to the exempt transaction should result to corresponding reduction of input tax credit balance.\n\n15. Verify the authenticity and validity of the input taxes claimed by the taxpayer in his/its VAT returns. Per RMO Nos. 16-2007 and 22-2007, it is not only enough that the taxpayer is able to present, upon audit, the corresponding sales invoices/official receipts to evidence these purchases declared, but there is a further need to ascertain the legitimacy and factual existence of \"big-ticket\" items of purchases and validate whether these have been appropriately recorded in the books of accounts and reflected in the filed tax returns of both the taxpayer and the seller/supplier of goods/services.\n\nFor this purpose, \"big-ticket\" items of purchases shall refer to local purchases made from suppliers whose individual gross annual cumulative sales to the particular taxpayer-purchaser accounts to more than five percent (5%) of said taxpayer-purchaser's annual gross purchases covering the period under audit based on Quarterly VAT returns.\n\nLikewise, \"big-ticket\" items of importation shall refer to those importations of goods by one and the same importer where the aggregate VAT paid thereon to the BOC prior to the release of goods from its custody amounts to One Hundred Thousand Pesos (Php100,000.00) or more per quarter.\n\n16. Check the authenticity and correctness of substantial claims and \"big ticket\" items of input tax credits through the following procedures:\n\na. Ascertain that the purchases made by the taxpayer for which input taxes have been claimed were likewise appropriately reported as sales by his/its respective suppliers in their corresponding VAT Returns/Income Tax Returns and in the summary lists of sales submitted to the BIR.\n\nAnalyze the pre-processed data, specifically the Summary List of Sales/Summary List of Purchases and Importations provided by the Audit Information Tax Exemptions and Incentives Division (AITEID) of the National Office, include the utilization in the memorandum report, and present the effect in the Revenue Officer's audit report on VAT (BIR Form 0507).\n\nb. In the absence of the Summary List of Sales from the suppliers in the NO, perform the following procedures:\n\nb.1. Access the BIR's Information System to determine whether the suppliers are duly registered as VAT taxpayers. If it is found out that the suppliers are not registered, or registered as Non-VAT taxpayers only but issuing VAT invoices, then pertinent information relative to the supplier and sales made to the taxpayer under audit must be endorsed to the Regional Investigation Division of the Regional Office or the National Investigation Division of the NO for tax fraud investigation and other appropriate action.\n\nDisallowance of the input taxes attributable to the sales made by these questionable suppliers shall only be done if, aside from the sales invoice or official receipt, no other evidence can be presented by the taxpayer to substantiate the authenticity of other purchases made.\n\nb.2. Obtain copies of the VAT returns of the suppliers with \"big ticket purchases\" by the taxpayer under audit from the appropriate BIR office where the suppliers are registered or from the BIR's Information System covering the taxable period of audit.\n\nb.3. For local purchases obtain secondary proofs/evidence to substantiate the authenticity of the purchases such as copies of delivery receipts of the suppliers and check vouchers and paid checks issued by the taxpayer with \"big ticket\" purchases. For importation, verify any discrepancy in the SLI and BOC data thru the Import Entry and Internal Revenue Declarations and other documents mentioned in item 10 which will be provided the taxpayer.\n\nUnder RMO No. 22-2007, disallow any irreconcilable discrepancy noted between the declaration of input taxes claimed in the VAT returns and those actually paid to the BOC. Thus, deficiency VAT must be assessed on account thereof.\n\n17. In case of acquisition of capital goods in 2021 and prior years, check if the following rules were applied:\n\na. Where the aggregate acquisition cost (exclusive of VAT) of the existing or finished depreciable capital goods purchased or imported during any calendar month does not exceed one million pesos (P1,000,000), the total input taxes will be allowed as credit against output tax in the month of acquisition.\n\nb. Where the aggregate acquisition cost (exclusive of VAT) of the depreciable capital goods in a calendar month exceeds one million pesos (P1,000,000), regardless of the acquisition cost of each capital goods purchased/imported, the input taxes shall be claimed as credit against output tax in the following manner:\n\nb.1. If the estimated useful life of a capital goods is five (5) years or more, the input tax shall be spread evenly over a period of sixty (60) months and the claim for input tax credit will commence in the calendar month when the capital asset is acquired. The total input taxes on purchases or importations of this type of capital goods shall be divided by 60 and the quotient will be the amount to be claimed monthly.\n\nb.2. If the estimated useful life of a capital goods is less than 5 years, the input tax shall be spread evenly on a monthly basis by dividing the input tax by the actual number of months comprising the estimated useful life of the capital asset. The claim for input tax credit shall commence in the calendar month that the capital assets/goods were acquired.\n\nb.3. For the amortized portion of the input VAT on aggregate purchases of capital goods exceeding one million pesos (P1,000,000.00) in a month pursuant to Section 110 (A) (2) of the Tax Code, as amended, the following rules shall apply:\n\nb.3.1. For current purchases, the corresponding sales invoices and/or official receipts, including proofs of payment, if qualified as \"big ticket\" purchase, shall be required to be submitted and verified.\n\nb.3.2. An asset acquired on installment for an acquisition of more than one million pesos (P1,000,000.00), excluding the VAT, will be subject to the amortization of input tax despite the fact that the monthly payments/installments may not exceed one million pesos (P1,000,000.00).\n\nb.3.3. For the amortized deferred input VAT which originated from purchases prior to the period of claim, the schedule of amortization of deferred input VAT in the approved report of the prior year's audit, if any, will be the basis in determining the amortized portion. If there was no audit in the prior year(s), the RO should verify the proof of the purchase of the capital goods to determine the reckoning date of the amortization.\n\nThe amortization of input tax on capital goods purchased or imported until December 31, 2021 shall be allowed as scheduled until fully utilized.\n\nFor purchase of capital goods beginning January 1, 2022, its corresponding input VAT shall be claimed on the month of purchase pursuant to Revenue Regulations No. 13-2018.\n\n18. Determine the allowable input tax on Construction in Progress\n\nConstruction in progress (CIP) is the cost of construction work which is not yet completed. CIP is not depreciated until the asset is placed in service. Normally, upon completion, a CIP item is reclassified and the reclassified asset is capitalized and depreciated.\n\nCIP is considered, for purposes of claiming input tax, as a purchase of service, the value of which shall be determined based on the progress billings. Until such time the construction has been completed, it will not qualify as capital goods as herein defined, in which case, input tax credit on such transaction can be recognized in the month the payment was made, provided, that an official receipt of payment has been issued based on the progress billings.\n\nIn case of contract for the sale of service where only labor will be supplied by the contractor and the materials will be purchased by the contractee from other suppliers, input tax credit on the labor contracted shall still be recognized on the month the payment was made based on a progress billing while input tax on the purchase of materials shall be recognized at the time the materials were purchased.\n\nOnce the input tax has already been claimed while the construction is still in progress, no additional input tax can be claimed upon completion of the asset when it has been reclassified as a depreciable capital asset and depreciated.\n\n19. Verify the correctness of the claim for presumptive input tax, if any.\n\na. Ascertain the legal basis for entitlement to the claim for presumptive input tax.\n\nb. Check whether the taxpayer has complied with all the administrative requirements relative to the claim pursuant to existing rules and regulations.\n\nc. Check the reasonableness of the value of inventories used as a basis in computing the claim for presumptive input tax. Be alert on the possibility that the taxpayer may have deliberately inflated his inventory balance to take advantage of huge presumptive input tax credit or may have included items of inventories that are not entitled to any tax credit.\n\nAny record obtained pertinent to the identified supplier of the taxpayer should be considered strictly confidential and shall be used exclusively for internal revenue tax purposes. All employees who in any way made access to the system and manual files should be informed of the legal provisions governing unlawful disclosure of any taxpayer's information. Any divulgence, unless authorized by law, shall be a ground for the imposition of the administrative sanctions and filing of appropriate charges against the erring official and employee.\n\n20. Check income payment made to non-residents if the same are subject to VAT. If subject to VAT, verify if the final VAT withholding tax on rental, royalties, management fees and other taxable services paid to non-residents have been properly withheld and remitted using Form 1600.\n\n21. In case there is a claim for input tax on said transactions, ascertain that same is duly substantiated with contracts and proofs of payments, aside from Form 1600.\n\n22. Verify if the taxpayer over claimed input tax by comparing all possible sources of input tax per audited financial statement and input tax claimed in the current period per VAT return.\n\nE. Reporting Requirements\n\nThe audit report should be brief and concise but complete in all details necessary to its understanding. It must have the following contents but not limited to:\n\n1. Table of Contents\n\n2. Duplicate copy of the electronic Letter of Authority (eLA)\n\n3. General VAT Audit Plan\n\n4.

Revenue Tax Administration\n\nThe function of the Bureau of Internal Revenue (Bureau) is to administer the provisions of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997 (Tax Code), as amended. It is the duty of the Bureau to implement the Tax Code, related laws with tax implications enacted by Congress, as well as the revenue issuances, in a fair and impartial manner.\n\nThe mission of the Bureau is to collect taxes for nation-building through excellent, efficient and transparent service, just and fair enforcement of tax laws, to be able to uplift the life of every Filipino.\n\nInvestigation or audit supports the mission of the Bureau by enhancing a high degree of tax compliance from taxpayers and taxable persons, and encouraging the correct reporting of income, transfer, business and other taxes. This is accomplished by:\n\n1. Measuring the degree of voluntary compliance as reflected on filed returns;\n\n2. Reducing non-compliance by identifying and examining tax returns, taxpayers and transactions that need to be investigated based on a general audit program with audit selection criteria; and\n\n3. Conducting quality audit of selected tax returns on a timely and regular basis.\n\nThe purpose of auditing a tax return is to determine the taxpayer's correct tax liability and eventually, enhancing his/its tax compliance. A quality audit is the examination of a taxpayer's books and records in sufficient depth so as to ascertain the correctness and validity of entries thereon and the proper application of pertinent provisions of the Tax Code, tax laws and existing regulations.\n\nB. Purpose\n\nThis Handbook on Audit Procedures and Techniques has been updated to equip all Revenue Officers (ROs) who conduct field examinations with the necessary knowledge for the proper examination of the tax returns and provide them with confidence in carrying out the investigation in the light of the Philippine Financial Reporting Standards (PFRS) and Philippine Accounting Standards (PAS). This handbook is designed to ensure that the ROs are provided with improved auditing skills and tax knowledge to be able to face the challenges of accounting and financial reporting the taxpayers apply.\n\nC. Contents of the Handbook\n\nThis revised handbook contains guides, instructions and suggestions in the conduct of audit for various types/kinds of taxpayers. The discussions begin with the analysis of tax returns and financial statements, familiarization with accounting methods, bookkeeping systems, books of accounts and other related records. The audit procedures for balance sheet and income statement accounts are laid out together with investigation techniques for each tax type after taking into account the new standards of accounting and financial reporting. This does not preclude, however, the RO from carrying out other audit techniques which are deemed necessary in the circumstances surrounding a particular case. DETACa\n\nThe handbook is neither intended to provide a source of tax law or procedural doctrine nor a substitute reference material of revenue issuances. Each RO is presumed to have a working knowledge of the Tax Code, the latest amendments thereon, and an update of applicable existing revenue regulations, revenue rulings, revenue memorandum orders and other issuances. Likewise, he should be familiar with the basic accounting principles, methods, chart of accounts and treatment of transactions taken up by taxpayers in their books of accounts and reflected in their financial statements.\n\nThe other contents of this handbook include documentary requirements in the investigation process and proper making of reports.\n\nII. ACCOUNTING METHODS\n\nPursuant to Section 43 of the Tax Code, as amended, the taxable income of a taxpayer shall be computed in accordance with the method of accounting he regularly employs in keeping his books. However, if the taxpayer does not regularly employ a method of accounting which reasonably shows his correct income, the computation of the income shall be made in such a manner as in the opinion of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue or his duly authorized representative clearly reflects such income.\n\nThe methods of accounting recognized in Philippine Taxation are:\n\nA. Cash Basis is a method of accounting whereby all items of gross income received during the year shall be accounted for such taxable year and that only expenses actually paid for shall be claimed as deductions during the year. This method of accounting is generally used by taxpayers who do not keep regular books of accounts. Under this method, income is realized upon receipt of cash or its equivalent including those constructively received (such as deposits for the taxpayer's account by customers) but not including gifts or donations. Users of cash basis accounting are mostly individuals engaged in business and practice of profession, professional partnerships and professional service organizations.\n\nB. Accrual Basis is a method of accounting for income in the period it is earned regardless of whether it has been received or not. In the same manner, expenses are accounted for in the period they are incurred and not in the period they are paid. Under this method, net income is being measured by the excess of income earned during the period over the expenses incurred. Expenses not being claimed as deductions by taxpayers in the current year when they are incurred cannot be claimed as deduction from income for the succeeding year. Thus, a taxpayer who is authorized to deduct certain expenses and other allowable deductions for the current year but failed to do so cannot deduct the same for the next year. The accrual basis of accounting is being used by a taxpayer whose nature of business uses inventories since this method of accounting will correctly reflect income by matching purchases and expenses against sales. This method is being applied by most medium and large corporations.\n\nC. Percentage of Completion Basis is a method applicable in the case of a building, installation or construction contract covering a period in excess of one year whereby gross income derived from such contract may be reported upon the basis of percentage of completion. In determining the percentage of completion of a contract, generally one of the following methods is used:\n\n1. The costs incurred under the contract as of the end of the tax year are compared with the estimated total contract costs; or\n\n2. The work performed on the contract as of the end of the tax year is compared with the estimated work to be performed.\n\nIn such case, the return should be accompanied by a certificate of the architect or engineer showing the percentage of completion during the taxable year of the entire work performed under contract. There should be deducted from such gross income all expenditures made during the taxable year on account of the contract, account being taken of the materials and supplies on hand at the beginning and end of the taxable period for use in connection with the work under the contract but not yet so applied. aDSIHc\n\nBeginning January 1, 1998 income from long-term contracts is required to be reported using this method only.\n\nD. Installment Basis is a method considered appropriate when collections extend over relatively long periods of time and there is a strong possibility that full collection will not be made. As customers make installment payments, the seller recognizes the gross profit on sale in proportion to the cash delivered. Moreover, Section 49 (B) of the Tax Code, as amended, states, \"In the case (1) of a casual sale or other casual disposition of personal property (other than property of a kind which would properly be included in the inventory of the taxpayer if on hand at the close of the taxable year), for a price exceeding One thousand pesos (P1,000), or (2) of a sale or other disposition of real property, if in either case the initial payments do not exceed twenty-five percent (25%) of the selling price, the income may, under the rules and regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Finance, upon recommendation of the Commissioner, be returned on the basis and in the manner above prescribed in this Section. As used in this Section, the term \"initial payments\" means the payments received in cash or property other than evidences of indebtedness of the purchaser during the taxable period in which the sale or other disposition is made.\"\n\nE. Crop Year Basis is a method applicable only to farmers and taxpayers engaged in agriculture, livestock, fishery and similar undertaking for business where the production of crops, livestock and other biological assets take more than a year from the time of planting or raising to the process of disposal.\n\nA farmer under this method shall include in his gross income for the taxable year:\n\n1. The amount of cash or the value of merchandise or other property received from the sale of livestock, and produce which were raised during the taxable year or prior years\n\n2. The profit from the sale of any livestock or any other items which were purchased\n\n3. The amount of cash from the sale of crops produced during the crop year\n\n4. Gross income from all other sources\n\nExpenses paid or incurred are deductible in the year the gross income from the sale of the crops/livestock and other biological assets are realized.\n\nUnder the PFRS and PAS, the acceptable accounting methods are the cash and accrual basis. However, most non-individual taxpayers use the accrual method. Notwithstanding the accounting standard, the aforesaid accounting methods are acceptable for tax purposes as long as they are consistently applied.\n\nA taxpayer who changes the method of accounting employed in keeping his books shall, before computing his income upon such new method for purposes of taxation, secure the consent of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. Application for permission to change the accounting method and the basis upon which the return is made shall be filed within 90 days after the beginning of the taxable year to be covered by the return. The application shall be accompanied by a statement specifying all amounts which would be duplicated or entirely omitted as a result of the proposed change. Permission to change the accounting method shall not be granted unless the taxpayer and the Commissioner of Internal Revenue agree to the terms and conditions under which the change will be effected.\n\nIII. BOOKKEEPING SYSTEMS\n\nBookkeeping may be classified into two systems, namely, (1) the single entry and (2) the double entry.\n\nA. Single Entry System of bookkeeping is basically a type of \"net worth\" method of arriving at net income. It records only the debit or credit of each transaction, or an account with the debtor or creditor and a simple record of cash receipts and disbursements. ETHIDa\n\nWhenever a system of recordkeeping does not include equal debit and credit to asset, liability, proprietorship or net worth, income and expense accounts, it is referred to as a \"single entry system.\" The single entry is often used by comparatively simple ventures such as small retail or commission merchants, professional firms, estates and trusts. In many cases, the only record of income and deduction consists of entries on the stubs of their checkbooks. Some taxpayers maintain an income tax folder in which they place documents to support their income tax deductions.\n\nA single entry system may be merely a chronological record of transactions posted in a notebook or journal.\n\nSometimes, the records consist of a complete set of journals (cash, sales, purchases and general journal) and general ledger providing important accounts.\n\nB. Double Entry System \u2014 Under this system of bookkeeping, accounting recognizes the two-fold effect of every recorded event, the debit and the credit or the object of the event and the equitable interest in that object. Every recorded event affecting one side must necessarily affect the other side. This can be presented in an equation:\n\nAssets = Liabilities + Equity\n\nThis can be analyzed into its component elements which show that there are two distinct parties that have right in the assets of the business, the creditors and the owners. The rights of the creditors are the claims of such creditors on the assets of the business which are referred to as liabilities and the rights of the owners on the business are referred to as equity.\n\nIn the double entry method, any net increase and net decrease in asset has a corresponding increase and decrease in either liabilities or capital.\n\nAudit of accounting records under this system shall be detailed as presented in the discussions of audit of real and nominal accounts.\n\nIV. ACCOUNTING RECORDS\n\nPursuant to Section 235 of the Tax Code, as amended, taxpayers are required to preserve and maintain accounting records in sufficient detail to enable them to make a proper return of income and in order that all taxes due the government may readily and accurately be ascertained and determined anytime of the year. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue, under Section 5 of the Tax Code, as amended, is authorized to examine such records or other data which may be relevant in ascertaining the correctness of the tax returns. The books and records kept must be sufficient to establish the amount of the gross income and the deductions, credits and other matters required to be shown in the tax return.\n\nThe primary records commonly used by all types of businesses, considering the different accounting systems and reporting methods of the business are invoices, vouchers, bills, receipts and other source documents which are also the supporting documents in the selling and buying of merchandise, services and other assets used in the business. For companies which require the use of inventories, the primary records include the detailed inventory list. Other primary records used in financial transactions are the cancelled checks, duplicate deposit slips, bank statements and notes.\n\nThe secondary records, regardless of the accounting method used by the taxpayer, include permanent books of accounts and working papers which summarize and list the individual documents including adjustments, when necessary. These records are properly classified in such a way that the taxpayer will be able to determine the financial status of his business in a given period of time and the profit and loss for the period. cSEDTC\n\nAll records required to be kept by the taxpayers should be preserved by them for proper administration of any internal revenue law. Under existing revenue issuances, all taxpayers are required to preserve their books of accounts, including subsidiary books and other accounting records, for a period of ten (10) years reckoned from the day following the deadline in filing a return, or if filed after the deadline, from the date of the filing of the return, for the taxable year when the last entry was made in the books of accounts, provided that, within the first five (5) years reckoned from the day following the deadline in filing a return, or if filed after the deadline, from the date of the filing of the return, for the taxable year when the last entry was made in the books of accounts, the taxpayer shall retain hardcopies of the books of accounts, including subsidiary books and other accounting records. Thereafter, the taxpayer may retain only an electronic copy of the hardcopy (paper) of the books of accounts, subsidiary books and other accounting records in an electronic storage system which complies with the requirements set forth in the regulations.\n\nBelow are the regular accounting records being used by taxpayers:\n\nA. Journal is a book of original entry in which transactions affecting the business of a taxpayer are recorded consecutively and chronologically day by day as they occur:\n\nJournal consists (but not limited to) of the following:\n\n1. Sales Journal \u2014 is a book where all sales, whether cash or on account, are recorded, which are supported by sales invoices and are also the documents that will serve as the basis of recording the transactions in the books of accounts.\n\nCash sales are usually recorded in the cash receipts book although it may be posted in both books representing a debit to cash in the cash book and a credit to sales in the sales book.\n\nEvery entry in the sales journal pertaining to sales on account represents a debit to a customer's account and a credit to sales to be posted in the general ledger.\n\nSales returns and allowances are also recorded in the sales book which represents a debit to Sales Returns and Allowances and a credit to Accounts Receivable to be posted in the general ledger. This would mean a decrease in Sales and eventually a decrease in an asset account.\n\n2. Purchase Journal \u2014 is a book whereby all transactions involving the purchase or acquisition of merchandise, whether cash or on account, are recorded which are supported by purchase invoice and are also the documents that will serve as the basis of recording the transactions in the books of accounts.\n\nCash purchases are usually recorded in the cash disbursement book although it may be posted in both books representing a debit to cash in the cash book and a credit to purchases in the purchases book.\n\nAn entry to record purchases on account is a debit to Purchases and a credit to Accounts Payable to be posted in the general ledger.\n\nPurchase returns and allowances are also recorded in this book and posted in the general ledger representing a debit to Accounts Payable and a credit to Purchase returns and allowances which would mean a decrease in the purchases account. SDAaTC\n\nIn certain instances, where the volume of business is large and under the Value-Added Tax system, taxpayers maintain subsidiary sales and purchase journals where details of daily sales and purchases are recorded.\n\n3. Cash book is a book whereby all transactions involving cash such as cash receipts or cash disbursements are recorded.\n\nTypes of this book are the following:\n\na. Cash receipts book \u2014 a book whereby all transactions involving cash receipts of whatever source are recorded.\n\nb. Cash disbursements book \u2014 a book whereby all transactions involving cash or check disbursements are recorded.\n\nB. Ledger is a book of final entry wherein the classified accounts or items of all transactions entered in the journal must be posted to the ledger and shall be classified accordingly so as to show the assets, liabilities, equity and the operating accounts. This will be the basis for the preparation of the trial balance and eventually the balance sheet and the profit and loss statement covering the operations of the business for a certain period. No entry shall be made in the ledger unless said entry originates from the journal.\n\nThe accounts contained in the general ledger provide the RO with insight of the operations of the business. When pertinent, the chart of accounts and subsidiary ledgers, if any, should be requested from the taxpayer. If a private ledger is maintained, it should also be requested.\n\nAs the RO goes through the ledger, unusual or non-recurring items should be noted and verified. Most of these items are classified as follows:\n\n1. Unusual in amount \u2014 The RO should be alert for month-end entries with significant amounts which may affect income and expenses.\n\n2. Unusual by source \u2014 Source means the books of accounts from where the entries to the ledger account originated. Hence, the expenses or adjustments to income which do not ordinarily originate from the cash journals, sales and purchase books should be investigated. Such adjustments originating from the general journal or journal vouchers should be thoroughly examined as to supporting documents and proper authorization.\n\n3. Unusual by nature \u2014 An entry in a ledger account may be unusual by nature as well as by the account itself. Accounts with abnormal balances such as receivable accounts with credit balances may indicate income which is credited to receivables instead of sales. Unusual accounts such as suspense, other receivables, due to stockholders, and such other unusual liability accounts should be analyzed as there may be some income components lodged into these accounts.\n\nC. Subsidiary Book. In the general ledger, accounts are usually transferred and grouped into certain accounts to a subsidiary book. This general ledger account is called control account. Control accounts in the general ledger contain summarized information that is recorded in detail in a subsidiary book or ledger.\n\nThus, in order to relieve the general ledger of too many individual accounts, business concerns having numerous accounts with customers and creditors will transfer said accounts to separate ledgers \u2014 one for customers and one for creditors. For example, the control account for the customer's subsidiar book will be called \"Accounts Receivable,\" while the control account for the creditor's subsidiary book will be called \"Accounts Payable.\"\n\nAll corporations, companies, partnerships or persons required by law to pay internal revenue taxes have the option to keep this kind of book depending on the need of their business, provided that where such books are kept, they shall form part of the accounting records of the taxpayer and shall be subject to the same rules and regulations as to their keeping, translation, production and inspection as are applicable to the journal and the ledger. acEHCD\n\nD. Computerized Accounting System (CAS). This method of accounting is now being used by most companies. It is a system whereby information is fed into the computer thus providing uniformity in the processing of transactions.\n\nAll taxpayers engaged in business who have CAS or components thereof shall apply for permit prior to its use. Furthermore, taxpayers applying for e-invoicing system shall apply for a complete CAS provided the system is capable of generating hard copy of the invoice anytime.\n\nThe RO should verify if the CAS or components thereof used by the taxpayer has been duly approved with a corresponding certificate of approval or permit to use.\n\nV. ACCOUNTING PERIODS\n\nAccounting periods are generally classified into two. They are:\n\nA. Calendar Year is an accounting period which starts from January 1 and ends on December 31. This is used by most taxpayers as their accounting period. However, the calendar year shall be the basis of computing the net income in the following cases:\n\n1. When the taxpayer is an individual;\n\n2. When the taxpayer does not keep books of accounts; and\n\n3. When the taxpayer has no annual accounting period.\n\nB. Fiscal Year is an accounting period of twelve months ending on the last day of any month other than December 31. Corporations and duly registered general co-partnerships are allowed to use this type of accounting period. A corporation and a general co-partnership have the option to choose between the calendar year and the fiscal year.\n\nC. Change in Accounting Period \u2014 If a taxpayer, other than an individual, changes his accounting period from fiscal year to calendar year, from calendar year to fiscal year, or from one fiscal year to another, the net income shall, with the approval of the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR), be computed on the basis of such new accounting period. Whenever a taxpayer changes its accounting period, the taxpayer is required to file with the BIR a separate final or adjustment return for the period between the close of the original accounting period and the date designated as the close of the new accounting period.\n\nA taxpayer can file an income tax return that has a taxable period of less than twelve (12) months only in the following cases:\n\n1. When a corporation is newly organized and commenced operations on any day within the year;\n\n2. When a corporation changes its accounting period;\n\n3. When a corporation is dissolved;\n\n4. When the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, by authority, terminates the taxable period of a taxpayer pursuant to Section 6 (D) of the Tax Code, as amended; and\n\n5. In case of estate tax, when a decedent dies at any day within the year.\n\nThe application for a change in accounting period should be filed with the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, through the Revenue District Office, where the business is registered sixty (60) days prior to the beginning of the proposed new accounting period.\n\nVI. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nFinancial Statements are reports signifying the end result of the financial accounting process. Furthermore, they provide information about the financial position, financial performance, cash flows and management stewardship of resources. They also assist in predicting the entity's future cash flows and in particular their timing and certainty.\n\nThe complete set of financial statements as prescribed in Philippine Accounting Standards (PAS) 1 are as follows: SDHTEC\n\nA. Statement of Comprehensive Income \u2014 is a report that summarizes the business activities for a given period and reports the net income or loss resulting from operations and from certain other activities. It is variously called the Income/Earnings Statement, Statement of Profit and Loss, and Statement of Operations. It normally consists of the following sections or items:\n\n1. Sales/Revenues \u2014 reports the total sales to customers and fees received from clients for the period. All sales transactions should be recorded and issued corresponding sales invoice or official receipt (OR).\n\n2. Cost of goods sold \u2014 refers to cost of goods relating to sales when merchandise is acquired from outsiders. This is the sum of the beginning inventory, purchases, and all other buying, freight and storage costs relating to the acquisition of goods and subtracting the ending inventory thereof. When the goods are manufactured by the seller, the cost of goods manufactured must first be calculated. This is the sum of the cost of goods in process at the beginning, the cost of materials put into production, the cost of labor applied and factory overhead incurred. The total cost as thus obtained represents the cost of both completed work and uncompleted work still in production. The ending goods in process inventory, then must be subtracted from this total in arriving at the cost of the product completed and made available for sale.\n\n3. Cost of services \u2014 refers to all direct costs and expenses necessarily incurred to provide the services required by the customers and client, including: (1) salaries and employee benefits of personnel, consultants and specialists directly rendering the service; and (2) cost of facilities directly utilized in providing the service such as depreciation or rental of equipment used and cost of supplies. HSAcaE\n\nExcept for banks and other financial institutions, cost of sales/services shall not include interest expense.\n\n4. Operating expenses \u2014 are expenses incurred or utilized in the course of business or pursuant to the practice of profession. They are generally reported in two categories:\n\na. Selling expenses; and\n\nb. General and administrative expenses.\n\nThe operating expenses as indicated in the Financial Statements of the taxpayer may not necessarily be considered allowable expenses for purposes of computing the taxable income. Section 34 of the Tax Code, as amended, provides items of allowable expenses that a certain taxpayer may deduct from the gross income. However, the taxpayer is allowed to elect a standard deduction of forty percent (40%) of the gross receipts/sales, in case of an individual subject to tax under Section 24 of the same Code, while it is forty percent (40%) of gross income as defined in Section 32 of the Tax Code, as amended, in the case of corporation subject to tax under Sections 27 (A) and 28 (A) (1), in lieu of the itemized allowable deductions.\n\nUnless the taxpayer signifies in his tax return his intention to elect the optional deduction, he shall be considered as having availed himself of the itemized deductions.\n\n5. Other Income and Expenses \u2014 include items identified with financial management and miscellaneous recurring activities. Other income includes interest and dividend income and income from rentals, royalties and service fees. Other expenses include interest expense and expenses related to the miscellaneous income items reported.\n\nB. Statement of Financial Position \u2014 is a report that shows the financial position of the business unit as of a specified moment of time. It is a status report rather than a flow report. It is variously called Balance Sheet, Statement of Condition, Statement of Resources and Liabilities, and Statement of Net Worth.\n\nThe Balance Sheet is the fundamental accounting statement in the sense that every accounting transaction can be analyzed in terms of its effect on the balance sheet. In order to understand the information a balance sheet conveys and how economic events affect the balance sheet, it is essential that the reader be absolutely clear as to the meaning of its two sides in the equation:\n\nAssets = Liabilities + Owner's Equity\n\n1. Assets \u2014 are economic benefits obtained or controlled by a particular entity as a result of past transactions or events. They include those costs that have not been matched with revenues in the past and are expected to afford economic utility in the production of revenue in the future. It includes both monetary assets, such as cash, marketable securities and receivables and non-monetary assets; those costs recognized as recoverable; and hence, properly assignable to revenues of future period, such as inventories, prepaid insurance, equipment and patents.\n\n2. Liabilities \u2014 measure the claims of creditors against entity resources. The method for settlement of liabilities varies. Liabilities may call for settlement by cash payment or settlement through goods to be delivered or services to be performed.\n\n3. Owner's Equity/Stockholder's Equity \u2014 is the residual interest in the assets of an entity that remains after deducting its liabilities. It measures the interest of the ownership group in the total resources of the enterprise. Such equities originally arise as the result of contributions by the owners and the equities change with the change in net assets resulting from operations.\n\nC. Statement of Changes in Equity \u2014 is a financial statement showing the equity at the beginning of the period, the changes that affect equity and the resulting equity at the end of the period. HESIcT\n\nUnder PFRS for Small and Medium Enterprises, the statement of changes in equity should show all changes in equity including comprehensive income, owner's investments and dividends, owner's withdrawals of capital and treasury share transactions.\n\nHowever, they can omit the statement of changes in equity if the entity has no owner investments or withdrawals other than dividends and elects to present a combined statement of comprehensive income and retained earnings.\n\nD. Statement of Cash Flow \u2014 is a financial statement that shows how the changes in balance sheet accounts and income affect cash and cash equivalents. It also reports the sources and uses of cash and break the analysis down to three activities, namely:\n\n1. Cash flow from operating activities;\n\n2. Cash flow from investing activities; and\n\n3. Cash flow from financing activities.\n\nE. Notes to Financial Statements \u2014 is an attachment with references to the aforementioned financial statements comprising a summary of the significant accounting policies and other explanatory notes and schedules. Generally, it will start with the general information/background followed by the basis of presentations.\n\nVII. PURPOSE AND STANDARDS OF AUDIT\n\nThe basic purpose of tax examination is the determination of correct taxable income as defined by the Tax Code, as amended, and other internal revenue tax liabilities of the person or entity whose return is being examined.\n\nIn conducting the examination, the RO's responsibility is two-fold: to the taxpayer and to the Philippine Government. Minimum standards of examination may be extended beyond the originally intended scope, or beyond minimum requirements because of situations or facts not apparent at the outset. The extent of verification to be done in any single tax examination is a matter of auditing judgment for which no rigid guide can be established. AcICHD\n\nThe degree of checking or scope of a tax examination may be influenced by an analysis of the taxpayer's accounting procedures and the results achieved therefrom, for they measure the credibility of the records and the degree of the existing system of internal control of the taxpayer.\n\nStandard refers to the criteria by which the quality of performance of auditing examinations is measured.\n\nThe following is the set of standards which should be observed by ROs in all aspects of the tax examination:\n\nA. General Standards\n\n1. Independence, in fact and in faith, or having an impartial attitude must be maintained in all affairs relating to an examination in order to assure a fair application of tax laws, regulations and rulings.\n\n2. Professional skill and ingenuity must be exercised in the performance of the examination and the preparation of the report.\n\n3. Issues should be raised only when, in the RO's opinion, they have real merit and will contribute to the proper determination of tax liability.\n\n4. The confidential nature of all information pertaining to any assignment must be strictly observed.\n\n5. The RO must exercise due professional care and ethical behavior during the performance of the audit.\n\nB. Standards of Preliminary Planning\n\n1. Sound judgment should be exercised in determining from assigned tax returns and financial statements those accounts which are most likely to contain areas of non-compliance and where the focus of the audit should be directed.\n\n2. Advance planning of work schedules with reasonable accuracy is essential for the effective use of time.\n\n3. A general audit plan should be formulated in each case prior to contacting the taxpayer, which includes the identification of possible risk areas, development of issues suggested by the return, financial statements, third party data and other information. The following steps may be included in the work plan:\n\na. Prepare an audit plan and checklist of requirements. Secure documents/information available within the Bureau (e.g., tax returns, Third Party Information (TPI), etc.)\n\nb. Draw up a list of questions to be asked from the taxpayer.\n\nc. Identify other agencies or offices where the RO can have access to their records if the taxpayer cannot present the documents requested.\n\nC. Standards of Field Work\n\n1. The RO assigned to the case shall serve a valid electronic Letter of Authority (eLA) in accordance with existing regulations.\n\n2. Audits should normally be performed at the taxpayer's place of business because of the accessibility of the books and records and to permit actual observation of taxpayer's facilities and scope of operations. Otherwise, it should be performed in the office of the Bureau of Internal Revenue.\n\n3. The use of accounting skills, tax knowledge and ingenuity should be directed toward recognizing risk areas including accounts that are prone to errors and misdeclaration.\n\n4. Adequate evidential matter should be obtained through inspection, observation, inquiry, analysis, documentation and other audit procedures deemed necessary to afford a reasonable basis for the determination of the correct tax assessment of the taxpayer. TAIaHE\n\nD. Standards of Reporting\n\n1. Reports shall be prepared in accordance with existing revenue issuances in a complete, clear, concise and legible manner in order that they may be easily read and understood.\n\n2. Working papers should be used as a practical and professional tool to aid the RO in the discussion of issues and questions with the taxpayer or his authorized representative. It also generally provides a record of the findings that led to the tax assessment by the RO. Thus, they should be properly labeled, indexed, signed and arranged in a logical and orderly manner.\n\n3. Reports shall be submitted within the prescribed period.\n\nE. Standards of Public Relations\n\n1. Initial contact for audit arrangements should be made with the taxpayer and due care should be exercised in explaining the documents and records required to be examined.\n\n2. ROs must be fully cognizant of the proper sources for gathering information and of the rights of the taxpayer and his representatives.\n\n3. Time and patience should be devoted to a discussion of any proposed adjustments to ensure that the taxpayer has a proper understanding of the issues.\n\n4. Tact and discretion are required in pointing out errors in books and records in order to avoid discrediting an employee or representative of the taxpayer.\n\nVIII. PRELIMINARY APPROACH TO EXAMINATION\n\nA. Pre-Audit Analysis of Tax Return\n\nPre-audit analysis of the return is essential to an effective audit. Preliminary analysis is used to identify potential issues which will be developed further after contacting the taxpayer. All information contained in any attachment to the tax return should be thoroughly and completely scrutinized to ascertain whether or not all of the information is adequately reflected in the tax return. Before contacting the taxpayer, the RO should familiarize himself with the following:\n\n1. The business organization of the taxpayer and whether it has business establishments other than its main or head office;\n\n2. The location of the business and its branches as this has relation to the volume of business;\n\n3. The industry in which the taxpayer is engaged in;\n\n4. The accounting books and records that would ordinarily be kept;\n\n5. The accounting methods and policies;\n\n6. The overall composition of the tax return;\n\n7. The types of income reported;\n\n8. Mathematical computation of the tax due and its components;\n\n9. Applicability of deductions claimed by the taxpayer;\n\n10. Correct utilization of Tax Credit Certificates which shall be duly supported by approved Tax Debit Memo;\n\n11. The reasonableness of expenses vis-\u00e0-vis the thresholds set by existing revenue issuances (e.g., representation & entertainment, charitable contributions, etc.);\n\n12. Unusual or unfamiliar items;\n\n13. Apparent questionable or unallowable items;\n\n14. Gross profit and selling expense percentage as well as significant variations between prior and current years;\n\n15. Inconsistencies in the treatment of bad debts, inventory valuation methods, depreciation rates and methods, etc.;\n\n16. Correctness of the reconciliation of net income per books against taxable income; cDHAES\n\n17. Applicability of Minimum Corporate Income Tax (MCIT) and Net Operating Loss Carry Over (NOLCO) applied in the current year;\n\n18. Prior year's entries in the reconciliation schedules of retained earnings in a corporate return and of a partner's capital account in a partnership return which affect the year under examination;\n\n19. The status of the retained earnings account as well as carrying value of assets; and\n\n20. The report of the tax liabilities of the taxpayer for the immediately preceding period in order to be aware of the deficiencies that were reported. Review of prior year's examination records will clarify some doubts or questions in the RO's mind regarding certain items.\n\nB. Work Planning\n\nWorks that are properly planned achieve good results.\n\nIn order to avoid any situation where the RO will be faced with a situation of a cramped audit workload and schedule, he should prioritize the audit of the assigned cases in the following manner:\n\n1. Mandatory cases as prescribed under the Audit Program for the taxable year covered\n\n2. Returns or cases where the statute of limitations is about to prescribe. (Prescriptive period is three (3) years counted from the date prescribed by law for the filing of the return, provided that in case a return is filed beyond the prescribed period, the three-year period shall be counted from the day the return was filed.)\n\n3. Cases assigned for reinvestigation\n\n4. Returns which would be more productive in terms of revenues should be given precedence over the less productive ones\n\nIn work planning, an Audit Plan should be prepared for every case. An Audit Plan contains relevant and significant information about the case and the taxpayer under audit. It also contains a checklist of the various auditing procedures to be undertaken, from preparation/planning to reporting, and the various books of accounts, records, documents and business forms to be verified in order to assess the correct tax due from a taxpayer. This checklist would serve as a guide for the RO to conduct a \"quality audit\" within the time frame allowed to conclude a tax audit. It is also a tool of the tax administrators to check on the progress of the tax audit and for proper evaluation of the performance of the RO.\n\nC. Contact with Taxpayer\n\n1. Serving of eLA\n\na. On the first opportunity of the RO to have a personal contact with the taxpayer, he should present the eLA together with the checklist of requirements. The eLA should only be served by the RO assigned to the case. He should have the proper identification card and should be in proper uniform. However, the service of eLA may likewise be done in other manners as prescribed in existing policies.\n\nb. An eLA authorizes or empowers a designated RO to examine, verify and scrutinize a taxpayer's books and records in relation to his internal revenue tax liabilities for a particular period.\n\n2. Request for Accounting Records\n\nThe initial request for accounting records shall be served with the eLA. In this request, the RO should clearly specify the records he desires to be assembled for his examination. Among the books and records that may be required are:\n\na. receipts (official receipts, warehouse receipts, delivery receipts, etc.);\n\nb. invoices (sales and purchases invoices);\n\nc. vouchers;\n\nd. cancelled checks;\n\ne. bills and statements of accounts (utility bills, payment notices, etc.); ASEcHI\n\nf. contracts (sales/purchase contracts, loan contracts);\n\ng. journals (regular and subsidiary journals); and\n\nh. ledgers (regular and subsidiary ledgers).\n\nIn case of failure of the taxpayer to comply with the initial request for accounting records within the prescribed period, a reminder letter shall be prepared by the RO assigned to the case. Further failure to comply with the reminder letter shall render the issuance of a Subpoena Duces Tecum (SDT).\n\n3. Initial Interview\n\nThe initial interview is an important part of the examination process and should be conducted in all audits. The interrogation should be conducted as to encourage the taxpayer to contribute willingly useful information which will assist in the proper determination of his tax liability. The information developed by this method may affect the eventual outcome of the case. The preliminary interview should, as far as practicable, cover the following:\n\na. Discussion of sources of income \u2014 this may uncover possible sources of income which have not been reported such as interests on investments and deposits, dividends, rents, sales of properties as well as information on the taxpayer's financial history and standard of living\n\nb. Records kept for each source of income\n\nc. Handling and recording of cash transactions\n\nd. Records of loans from banks and other creditors\n\ne. Real or personal properties bought or sold in the current year\n\nf. Other items that would be relevant in the examination, to wit:\n\nf.1 Responsible officers of the firm in order to facilitate acquisition of information/data;\n\nf.2 Place and time of audit;\n\nf.3 Ocular inspection of the factory, branches, outlets, etc.;\n\nf.4 Officers to whom the tax audit findings will be discussed; and\n\nf.5 Financial history and standard of living of the owner/s.\n\nD. Preliminary Evaluation of Relevant Records\n\nThe investigation on the taxpayer's books of accounts may begin with miscellaneous records other than accounting ledgers and journals. More often than not, scrutiny of these records may reveal items which the RO should take into consideration as the examination progresses. The records and information to be obtained are the following:\n\n1. Minute Book\n\nThe review of the minute book should not be confined to the taxable year under audit but should cover at least some period immediately before or after. As the RO scans the minute book, he should note appropriate transactions and items of significance, such as contracts entered into by the taxpayer, stock issuance, dividend declaration and compensation of officers. ITAaHc\n\n2. Stock Transfer Book\n\nThis book contains the name of stockholders, past and present, with the number of shares cancelled and issued. This book is also vital in computing documentary stamp tax liabilities. A general knowledge of the names of large shareholders is also of value when checking the salary expense and fringe benefits. When the stock and transfer book is not available, the record of dividend payment is an alternative source of similar information.\n\n3. Partnership Agreement\n\nA copy of the partnership agreement should be obtained and certain provisions affecting partner's salaries, profit and loss sharing, interest on capital, other allowances and other matters which may have tax consequences should be noted.\n\n4. Audit Report of Independent Auditors\n\nThe RO should read the auditor's report accompanying the financial statements. Sometimes, ROs fail to evaluate the auditor's report. However, there are cases when auditors do not issue an unqualified opinion. Any qualification or unusual comments in the auditor's report or certificate such as expression of opinion as to taxpayer's depreciation policy, inventory and cost valuation, adequacy of reserves, status of collectability of receivables and the like should be noted for consideration and should be related to the examination of accounts.\n\nIn cases where the auditor issues two reports, one for management and the other for attachment to the tax return, the former should be studied and compared with the latter. Income and net worth in both reports may vary from income and net worth per books due to the auditor's adjusting entries not reflected in the books. Thus, the adjusting entries and supporting documents should be examined. If needed, the auditor's working papers should be looked into to explain these entries.\n\n5. Auditor's Working Papers\n\nAudits, particularly of large companies, may frequently be simplified and facilitated, if the examining ROs are given access to the auditor's working papers. Where necessary, authorization from the taxpayer or requests for access to said working papers signed by duly authorized officials shall be secured to be able to scrutinize the working papers of auditors, particularly the year-end adjustments, intercompany transactions, nature of receivables and other peculiar accounts.\n\n6. Statements and Schedules Filed with Government Regulatory Agencies\n\nCertain taxpayers are required to file financial statements and other reports with government bodies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission for corporate taxpayers, the Garments and Textile Export Board for garments exporters, the Board of Investments for exporters and other similar government offices. The RO should compare the statements filed with the Bureau of Internal Revenue against those filed with other government offices. Any discrepancy should be inquired into and material differences should undergo an in-depth investigation.\n\n7. Appraisal Reports\n\nAppraisal reports, particularly real estate appraisals, are important in many cases such as for capital gains tax/withholding tax verification, as well as valuation of properties subject to estate/donor's tax.\n\nE. Initial Examination Techniques\n\n1. Understanding the Taxpayer's Books and Records\n\nTo have an understanding of the taxpayer's accounting system and records, one technique that should be commonly used is for the RO to interview the taxpayer or his representative and ask him to walk him through the accounting process of the taxpayer's business operation which includes journalizing different transactions and posting thereafter. CHTAIc\n\n2. Reconciliation of Books and Returns\n\nAnother step in understanding the records is to perform a reconciliation of the books with the tax return. The following procedures and actions are recommended to assist the RO in the reconciliation process:\n\na. Request for a chart of accounts and identify account numbers and account titles.\n\nb. Identify unusual accounts.\n\nc. Scan the general ledger to discover unusual account entries.\n\nd. Ask the taxpayer for the tax working papers or any other type of working papers that were used to prepare the tax return.\n\ne. If the working papers are in the hands of the external auditor, the taxpayer should be advised to secure a copy thereof from their external auditor.\n\nf. If no working papers are available, request the taxpayer to prepare the reconciliation and supporting schedules used to arrive at the reconciliation of data as reflected in the books and the tax returns.\n\ng. Evaluate the Statement of Cash Flow to identify sales and purchases of fixed assets, investments made and disposed, loan and debt payments, capital contributions and other transactions that might not be readily apparent on the balance sheet and income statement.\n\n3. Performance of Compliance Tests\n\nThe RO should establish the level of reliance that can be placed on the books and records and determine whether the books show all the transactions which occurred.\n\nTo accomplish this, a compliance test would be performed on some transactions through the backward and forward approaches in verification as follows:\n\na. In the backward approach, the figures per tax return are traced to the trial balance, then to the general ledger, the various journals, and ultimately to the source documents such as sales invoice or official receipts. This approach is most commonly known as vouching which usually addresses all financial statements assertions except completeness. It is because testing for completeness requires the RO to search for evidence of unrecorded items. The backward approach is effective in checking unsupported expenses.\n\nb. In the forward approach also known as tracing, the RO should select a supporting document, say a sales invoice; and trace it through the sales journal, general ledger, trial balance and finally to the tax return. Tracing is often used as a test of the completeness assertion. Other assertions that are tested by this are the valuation and allocation and the presentation and disclosure assertions. The forward approach is usually used in uncovering unreported income.\n\n4. Analysis of Adjusting Journal Entries\n\nIt is important that the RO understands adjusting journal entries because tax issues are frequently discovered in the adjusting journal entries. These adjusting journal entries are usually accruals, deferrals, corrections or reclassifications of accounts.\n\na. Accruals are normally entries to record certain known and fixed amount of obligations or liabilities. Accruals are also used to book uncertain, contingent liabilities. Contingent liabilities are not fixed in amount or date and are not deductible for tax purposes. EATCcI\n\nb. Deferrals are typically used to defer or postpone recognition of income or expenses. An inspection of the deferred income account may reflect amounts representing services already performed. It may also show goods already shipped and received by the customer. In both of these situations, a deferral of income is not proper.\n\nc. Corrections of prior year's earnings, other adjustments (e.g., recognition of allowance for bad debts and/or depreciation) and reclassifications are made through adjusting journal entries which are recorded in the general journal or in the journal vouchers. Usually, these entries are taken from the auditor's working papers. The examining RO should scrutinize these entries, especially those credited directly to retained earnings, analyze the tax issues involved and note down possible tax assessments.\n\nd. When scanning adjusting journal entries, the following should also be looked into closely:\n\nd.1 Unusual and-non-recurring entries;\n\nd.2 Entries reducing assets as there could possibly be unreported gain on sale, incorrectly computed gain on sale, incorrectly computed installment sale, non-taxable exchange, or withdrawal of goods by the owner; and\n\nd.3 Entries increasing liabilities as these could represent fictitious or contingent liabilities, fictitious expenses, invalid loans to shareholders, or undeclared income credited to liability accounts.\n\nF. Evaluation of Internal Control\n\nInternal Control is a system of procedures in place to ensure that all business transactions are properly recorded and assets are adequately safeguarded. It also consists of policies and procedures designed to provide management with reasonable assurance that the company achieves its objectives and goals including reliability of financial reporting, compliance with applicable laws and the effectiveness and efficiency of operations. ISHCcT\n\nIt is mandatory for the RO to evaluate internal control for him to decide up to what extent the system can be relied upon. This will also determine the nature, extent and timing of audit tests to be applied in the examination and to plan subsequent audit procedures.\n\nMany classes of transactions of the taxpayer are very routinary. Accordingly, the taxpayer may establish strong internal controls over those transactions to ensure that misstatements are prevented or detected in a timely fashion. If the internal controls over a class of transactions are strong, the auditor may rely upon those controls.\n\nHowever, in order to rely, the auditor must perform:\n\n\u2714 Tests of Design: Would the controls prevent/detect errors?\n\n\u2714 Tests of Operational Effectiveness: Are the controls functioning as designed?\n\n1. Principles of Internal Control\n\nGood internal control assures good record keeping and the liability of the employees and the owner from misappropriating the assets. Some broad principles of internal control are:\n\na. Responsibilities should be clearly established.\n\nb. Adequate records should be maintained.\n\nc. Assets should be insured and employees bonded.\n\nd. Record keeping and custody should be separate.\n\ne. Responsibility for related transactions should be divided.\n\nf. Personnel should be rotated.\n\ng. Automation should be used whenever practical.\n\nh. Employees should be informed of prescribed procedures.\n\ni. The system should be under constant review.\n\n2. Elements of Internal Control\n\nInternal Control can be divided into five elements:\n\na. Control Environment \u2014 This includes the entity's organizational structure, methods of assigning authority and responsibility, integrity and ethical values, commitment to competence, board of directors and audit committee participation in governance and oversight, management's philosophy and operating style and human resource policies and practices.\n\nb. Risk Assessment \u2014 Risk assessment is the process of identifying, evaluating, and determining how to manage risks. It is also the taxpayer's identification and analysis of risks relevant to the preparation of the tax returns in accordance with the Tax Code and all applicable regulations are important in the design of internal controls.\n\nc. Information and Communication \u2014 Methods used to initiate, record, process, and report an entity's transactions and to maintain accountability for related assets.\n\nd. Monitoring \u2014 Taxpayer's ongoing and periodic assessment of the quality of internal control performance to determine whether controls are operating as intended and modified when needed.\n\ne. Control Procedures \u2014 These include the adequate segregation of duties, proper authorization of transactions and activities, adequate documents and records, physical control over assets and records and independent checks on performance.\n\nThese consist of the methods and records established to capture financial transactions such as sales, purchases, investments and payment of expenses and liabilities. This element is important to the RO for him to understand how transactions are initiated and recorded and to determine the degree of reliability to be placed in the taxpayer's books and records.\n\n3. Standard Procedures in Evaluating Internal Control\n\nTo establish the scope of the audit and degree of compliance tests to be performed, internal control should first be evaluated. There are five (5) basic steps in performing the assessment of the effectiveness of internals control over financial reporting. They are the following:\n\na. Planning \u2014 ROs should construct a plan prior to the start of the assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial planning. This includes review of the processes and sub-processes created by the taxpayer, specifically how these processes interact and controls that were put in place to mitigate known risks;\n\nb. Evaluating internal control at the entity level;\n\nc. Evaluating internal control at the process level;\n\nd. Testing control design and operating effectiveness at the transactional level; and\n\ne. Conclusion and findings.\n\nThere is a variety of different techniques to evaluate and test internal controls. Below are just a few that may be considered in conducting tests of internal controls:\n\na. Identify the personnel responsible for record keeping and determine their responsibilities and authority in the business operation.\n\nb. Identify the separation of duties and responsibilities.\n\nc. Reconcile the return with the books and records. Difficulty in reconciling the return with the books and records may be an indication of inadequate internal control in either financial or tax accounting.\n\nd. Interview responsible company personnel and observe business operations. Interviews may be in-person or in the form of questionnaires but is best conducted with an element of surprise. cEaSHC\n\ne. Review the chart of accounts and identify unusual accounts or note those accounts which should be included but not indicated.\n\nf. Secure and study copies of operating manuals or instructional booklets that may lead to an easy understanding of the taxpayer's business operations. There may also be a physical examination of documents deemed necessary for the evaluation.\n\ng. Determine if the taxpayer's personal transactions are segregated from business operations or if separate bank accounts are maintained by the owner and the business.\n\nh. Determine if bank accounts are reconciled monthly.\n\ni. Determine the books and records maintained and the frequency of recording transactions.\n\nj. Determine if pre-numbered documents are being used and check if said pre-numbered documents are properly accounted for through constant monitoring.\n\nk. Determine the extent of involvement of auditors and other third parties in the business.\n\nl. Determine if certified audits for any reason were conducted. If so, copies of documents in relation thereto should be secured.\n\nm. Determine if the income reported by the taxpayer reflects his lifestyle.\n\nn. Obtain confirmations of inventories at locations outside the entity.\n\nThe effective evaluation of internal control is dependent upon a very good interview, inspection, observation of the business operation, and testing of the system. Internal controls that appear to be high-risk may lead to the conclusion that lower reliance be placed in its financial reporting and declarations as well.\n\nG. Sampling Techniques\n\nSampling is a large and important part of the examination of a tax return. It is the application of examination procedures to less than 100% of the items in an account to evaluate its accuracy.\n\n1. Two Basic Types of Sampling\n\na. Statistical Sampling\n\nStatistical Sampling is the formal mathematical selection and examination of transactions, amounts or accounts based on the probability that moderately large number of items taken as samples will produce results, from which conclusion may be made. Statistical sampling techniques may include the following:\n\na.1 Convenience sampling \u2014 is a non-probability sampling technique where subjects are selected for convenience such as accessibility and proximity to the researcher.\n\na.2 Random sampling \u2014 is a popular probability sampling technique where each member of the population has an equal opportunity of being selected as subject. Subjects can be selected randomly with methods like lottery or computer-aided random selection.\n\na.3 Systematic sampling \u2014 is a technique where the RO first randomly picks the first item or subject from the population, then, he will select each nth subject from the list. CTIEac\n\na.4 Stratified sampling \u2014 is a probability sampling technique wherein the RO divides the population into different subgroups or strata; then he randomly selects the final subjects proportionally from the different subgroups or strata.\n\nb. Judgmental Sampling\n\nIn selecting accounts and transactions to be tested, judgmental sampling should be applied as it involves the use of professional judgment in planning and performing the sampling and analyzing the results.\n\nJudgmental Sampling may include any or both of the following methods:\n\nb.1 Block sampling \u2014 uses groups of continuous items selected from an account balance or class of transactions. An example is an RO's decision to sample one month of travel expense to reach a conclusion for the year.\n\nb.2 Peso limitation sampling or cut-off sampling \u2014 selects a minimum peso amount and transactions in excess of the said amount are verified.\n\n2. Factors to be considered in determining the sample size\n\na. Internal Control \u2014 The extent of sampling to be done is dependent on the degree of internal control. Thus, a small sample size is required if internal control can be greatly relied upon\n\nb. Accounting System \u2014 Large errors or high frequency of errors in the accounting system may require a large sample size\n\nc. Materiality \u2014 In choosing appropriate materiality thresholds, the absolute size of an item, the relative size and the nature of the business, and industry/business practice should be considered. Materiality of an item should be related to its tax consequence\n\nd. Analytical Review \u2014 In analytical review, the following consideration should be studied:\n\nd.1 Taxpayer's standard of living;\n\nd.2 Interest in closely held companies;\n\nd.3 Transactions between related parties;\n\nd.4 Transactions involving questions of fraud;\n\nd.5 Significant increases or decreases in taxable income from year to year; and\n\nd.6 Significant adjustments on previous RO's reports.\n\n3. Sampling Techniques to be applied in testing accounts and transactions\n\nThere are many types of sampling techniques. The RO is not precluded from discovering and applying new techniques as may be necessary in each particular case.\n\nListed below are the suggested sampling techniques in testing income statement and balance sheet items:\n\na. Select the first and last months of sales to ensure that income was not deferred incorrectly to a different year.\n\nb. The last month of the period under examination should be tested because of the likelihood of errors and unallowable adjustments made before the end of the year.\n\nc. Selection of the largest three months' incurrence of an expense account may reveal expenses that should be capitalized, personal expenses or padded expenses. SaCIDT\n\nd. Scan the cash disbursements journal and general ledger for unusual or very large entries. This step also familiarizes the RO with the accounts payees, suppliers and clients of the taxpayer.\n\ne. Select at least one month's file of paid checks. Thoroughly analyze each check together with the endorsement at the back. This could lead to the discovery of fictitious payees, unusual transactions, personal items charged to expense and other possible disallowances.\n\nf. Inspection of the corporate minutes and the articles of incorporation could lead to an RO's determination to sample a particular account.\n\ng. Examine certain accounts in the income statement in relation to the balance sheet accounts. Thus, Accounts Receivable should be analyzed together with Sales. Bad Debts Expense should be verified together with the Allowance for Bad Debts. Likewise, Accounts Payable should be examined together with Purchases and other related expenses.\n\nh. Test check source documents and related transactions by considering the persons involved, nature of the contract, mode of payment and other important aspects.\n\ni. Rounded figures should be checked as they may be estimates.\n\nj. Utilize results of analytical review in selecting the sample.\n\nk. Limit the scope of the sample if the majority of the samples are so completed and there are still no discrepancies.\n\n4. Examining the sample items\n\nThe sample items, as selected, should be verified as follows:\n\na. Analyze and determine the validity of the source documents.\n\nb. Examine all corroborating documents.\n\nc. Check with third parties.\n\nd. Inspect and observe inventory flow, fixed assets acquired, sales transaction and other transactions which may require ocular inspection.\n\n5. Analyzing the Results\n\nAnalyzing the result of a sample is an important yet commonly missed step. The sample taken should be evaluated and considered in relation to any peculiar situation, such as related-party transactions or economically unsound transactions. One example would be purchases made at unusually high or low prices. If the results of the sampling indicate potential tax assessment, an in-depth analysis should be conducted as follows:\n\na. Verify the account showing the discrepancy or possible source of tax deficiency.\n\nb. Trace the audit trail involving the transaction.\n\nc. Perform a 100% verification of such account.\n\nd. Consider performing third-party checks to substantiate transactions.\n\ne. Take a close look at how the taxpayer handled the entire transaction.\n\nf. Consider the adjustments associated to other accounts.\n\ng. Discuss the problems or discrepancies with the taxpayer or his authorized representative.\n\n6. Concluding the Sampling Results\n\nThe audit samples should be clearly documented in working papers from which a conclusion shall be drawn. If a quality sample analysis has been performed, it will be easy to form a conclusion from the sample results. The conclusion reached should be clear, concise and final. cHECAS\n\nIX. BALANCE SHEET APPROACH TO EXAMINATION\n\nA series of suggestions on the procedures for commencing the examination of tax returns, as well as financial statements and appropriate accounting records, have already been presented. The initial phase includes a verification of the net income per books with the reconciling items reflected in the tax return.\n\nAfter the foregoing process, the RO should turn his attention primarily to the books and records, bearing in mind that there are some reconciling items which affect the net income per books.\n\nThe following discussion offers guides and techniques in examining asset, liability and net worth accounts. The RO, however, is not precluded from applying other techniques which are deemed necessary in a particular case.\n\nA. Cash on Hand and in Bank\n\n1. Compare deposits shown in the bank statement against entries in the cash receipts book and official receipts. Note down any unrecorded deposit and investigate the source. Also, review the bank reconciliation done by the company.\n\n2. Test check cash sales with the cash receipts book if they have been correctly recorded. Also check cash sales made at the beginning and end of the period under examination to determine if year-end sales have been recorded in the proper accounting period.\n\n3. Investigate other forms of sale using installment method and the like to check the accuracy of the tax treatment made by the company for such transactions.\n\n4. Investigate entries in the general ledger cash account. Look for unusual items which do not originate from cash receipts or disbursements journals. These entries may indicate unauthorized withdrawals or expenditures, sales of capital assets, omitted sales, undisclosed bank accounts, etc.\n\n5. Review cash receipts journal for items not identified with ordinary business sales, being alert to such items as sale of assets, miscellaneous income, sale of scrap, income received in advance, proceeds from issuance of capital stock and other taxable transactions.\n\n6. Review cash on hand and cash in bank accounts to determine if there are any credit balances during the period under examination. The credit balances may indicate unrecorded receipts.\n\n7. Review cash disbursements journal for a representative period. Note any missing check numbers, checks payable to cash, large or unusual items and determine propriety thereof through a comparison with vouchers, journal entries and other related accounting records.\n\n8. If the taxpayer is on cash basis, ascertain if checks were written and recorded at the close of the period thereafter. Verify checks issued during the latter part of the year to check the authenticity of expenses claimed.\n\n9. Give particular attention to checks issued for cashier's checks, sight drafts and other similar bank instruments where the payees and nature of the disbursement are already shown.\n\n10. Obtain bank statements and paid checks for each bank account for one or more months, including the last month of the period under examination.\n\n11. Note year-end bank overdrafts. These may indicate expenses which are fictitious or unallowable since funds were not available for payment.\n\n12. Determine if there are checks which have remained outstanding for an unreasonable period of time. These may indicate improper, fictitious or duplication of disbursements. Old outstanding checks that are proven to be stale could possibly be restored to income. AHDacC\n\n13. Determine whether voided checks have been properly adjusted in the books and credited to the appropriate expense accounts, if applicable.\n\n14. For a test period, verify check endorsements to determine if they are the same as that of the payees' and if not, or in doubt, investigate further.\n\n15. If records appear unreliable or have not been subjected to a competent independent audit, test of footings and postings should be made for a representative period.\n\n16. Test check disbursements from petty cash to determine if there are any unallowable items included.\n\n17. Scrutinize cash overages and shortages, being alert to occurrence of irregularities.\n\n18. Tally debits and credits to the cash accounts per month against sales credit, debits to purchases and expense accounts and other sources and application of cash based on the worksheet of real and nominal accounts submitted by the taxpayer. Note down discrepancies and substantial accumulation of cash without reasonable credits.\n\nB. Notes and Accounts Receivable\n\n1. Secure a breakdown of the receivables by class, whether notes or accounts and by debtors, such as customers, affiliated companies, officers, stockholders, employees and others.\n\n2. Check entries in the general ledger control accounts. Look for unusual items, especially those which do not originate from the sales or cash receipts journals.\n\n3. Determine if subsidiary ledgers are in agreement with control accounts, and if not, ascertain the reasons for any differences.\n\n4. Compare the total of the period-end accounts receivable aging report to the total in the accounts receivable account in the general ledger. Investigate any discrepancies.\n\n5. Note any credit balances in the general ledger or subsidiary accounts. These may indicate deposits or overpayments which could be considered as additional income or unrecorded sales. Also, credit balances may indicate a misapplied bad debt recovery or deposits received for so long a time that there is little likelihood that they will ever be refunded. Whatever the cause, the credits, if material, should be isolated for consideration.\n\n6. Some credit sale invoices and postings should be test checked from the sales journal to the subsidiary and control account.\n\n7. Compare balances of accounts receivable and sales for the current year with that of the preceding year. Investigate significant changes.\n\n8. Investigate reconciling items and review justifications for the large and/or unusual balances and/or amounts classified as other accounts receivable. If justified, this should be fully documented.\n\n9. In case of notes receivable, determine whether accrued income on interest bearing notes or accounts has been included in income.\n\n10. Investigate the sources of notes receivable as there may be instances when the taxpayer has other sources of income other than his regular business.\n\n11. Determine whether accrued income on interest bearing notes or accounts has been included in the income. IDSEAH\n\n12. If needed, check the detailed listing of beginning receivables to cash collected as reflected in the cash receipts book. This may disclose diversion of funds and other irregularities.\n\n13. If the company is using the direct write-off method in recording bad debts, there will be no account for \"Allowance for Bad Debts.\" Thus, ascertain the reasonableness of the accounts written off in accordance with the Tax Code, as amended. Also, ensure its worthlessness by examining supporting documents.\n\nC. Allowance for Bad Debts\n\n1. Ascertain the company's policy of providing allowance for bad debts by examining minutes of meetings and other documents.\n\n2. Compare balances in the allowance account with that of the preceding years. Investigate significant changes.\n\n3. Evaluate the reasonableness of the allowance by computing the ratio of the balance of allowance for bad debts to the trade accounts receivable balance.\n\n4. Compute the ratio of bad debts expense over sales. Analyze if such is reasonable.\n\n5. Compare prior estimates for bad debts with actual bad debt write-offs. For an accounting period, the ratio between the bad debt expenses to actual write-offs should be very close to one (1). Investigate if there is significant difference.\n\n6. Analyze also the business exhaustion rate which is how long the beginning-of-year allowance will cover actual write-offs in order to know the sufficiency of the estimated allowance. If necessary, get the historical trend line of the exhaustion rate for the last three (3) years and investigate for any extraordinary rapid increase based on the said trend.\n\n7. Review the aging schedule of accounts receivable to determine whether the allowance appears reasonable.\n\n8. For accounts written off which were charged to expense, examine minute book for authorization to write off accounts.\n\n9. Ascertain that accounts written off are worthless by examining supporting documents such as reports of collection agencies, correspondence with said customers, documents filed in court, and court decisions on collection cases.\n\n10. If possible and necessary, check the financial status of the customers for which allowance for bad debts was provided.\n\n11. Check entries to the allowance account for possible bad debts recoveries and trace if the same were declared as income at the time of recovery.\n\nD. Inventories\n\n1. Determine the correct cost components to be included in the inventory. The costs used in determining inventory depend on whether the business is of a service, merchandising or manufacturing nature. Consigned goods should be segregated.\n\n2. Test for lower of cost or net realizable value.\n\n3. Review taxpayer's plan for performing inventory count.\n\n4. Verify the inventory valuation method being applied if such is acceptable for tax purposes and consistently applied from year to year.\n\n5. Compare inventory balances in the return under examination with the balances on the prior and subsequent year's returns and financial statement; then verify these with the taxpayer's records.\n\n6. Check BIR authorization for changes in inventory valuation method and verify taxpayer's compliance with the requirements set forth under existing rules and regulations.\n\n7. If necessary and possible, obtain the inventory count and reconcile the value to the general ledger balance. aCIHcD\n\n8. If applicable, verify the shipment policies for receiving and delivering goods and supplies and test the last few receiving and shipping transactions prior to the physical count, as well as transactions immediately following it, to ascertain proper accounting for such transactions. Moreover, determine if year-end purchases were included in the closing inventory.\n\n9. Check gross profit percentage variations. Conduct in-depth verification of items with substantial variations.\n\n10. Determine the significance of any notes or qualifying statements on financial reports prepared by independent accounting firms.\n\n11. Determine the taxpayer's computation of standard rates, if standard rates are applied.\n\n12. Verify cost of production reports and test check certain costs reflected therein to supporting documents.\n\n13. Analyze unusual entries to cost of sales account such as materials, labor and overhead charges not directly related to sales or transfers of finished goods, if applicable.\n\n14. Determine if there have been write-downs for \"excess\" inventory to below cost. Verify authorization and supporting document/report for such write-downs.\n\n15. Check the treatment for reversal of any write-down of inventories.\n\n16. When items have been removed from inventory for the owners' or shareholders' use, check if these are properly recorded as part of sales.\n\n17. These required minimum audit procedures, however, should not deter the RO from making a more detailed examination of the inventory account, when necessary.\n\n18. Review freight costs. Ascertain that there should be a consistent treatment for freight in the books.\n\n19. Ascertain if inventory losses claimed as tax deduction meets any of the following: AHCETa\n\na. Losses from the sale of excess or obsolete raw materials;\n\nb. Losses from production of initial batches of new products; or\n\nc. Production losses from reprocessing of stocks returned for reconditioning.\n\n20. All write-offs of inventories must be supported by a BIR Certificate of Destruction in order to be tax deductible.\n\nE. Advances to Stockholders/Officers\n\nThis receivable account may represent an outright advance of money by the corporation to officers and/or stockholders. Usually, these advances vary in amounts over a period of time, consequently, building up the current amount. The following verification procedures on this account should be conducted, if warranted:\n\n1. Verify authorization from Board of Directors for advances and loans to stockholders and officers by checking duly approved minutes of meetings.\n\n2. Identify company officers and stockholders who are granted advances regularly.\n\n3. Determine authenticity of advances and/or loans by verifying documents of the agreement or contract.\n\n4. Check payments of advances to the company if such loan repayments earned interest for which no withholding tax was deducted.\n\n5. Verify entries and supporting documents on cancellation of advances if the same do not originate from cash receipts.\n\nF. Investment\n\nThe investments most commonly found on the books are stocks and bonds and, in some cases, real estate not used in actual business operations. The following procedures should be conducted in the examination of investments, if such are material assets of the taxpayer:\n\n1. Familiarize with the nature of investments, utilizing any records maintained by the taxpayers such as the investment ledgers, worksheets showing the breakdown of investments and other investment records.\n\n2. Analyze sales and other credit entries to the account. If stocks sold are listed in the stock market, test check selling price of stocks sold at the prevailing \"close\" price at the Philippine Stock Exchange during the date of the sale. Real properties sold should not fall below fair market value and/or zonal value where the zonal value has been established. The application of the \"whichever is higher\" rule shall be observed.\n\n3. Verify cost and fair market value of the investment transactions from the monthly broker's statement, if there is any.\n\n4. Verify journal entries to ascertain the selling price and gain on sale of investments. Vouch supporting documents such as deeds of sale, proof of remittance of taxes withheld, payment of documentary stamp tax and other relevant records.\n\n5. Investigate sales to related parties and/or officers or stockholders below fair market value.\n\n6. Cross-check all investments during the year to the interest, dividend or rental income accounts.\n\n7. If investments or bonds were acquired at a premium or at a discount, determine whether the premium/discount is amortized over the life of the bond.\n\n8. Ascertain if unrealized and realized gains and/or losses are recorded properly in the books.\n\n9. Determine if investments are properly recognized and classified in their right accounts.\n\nG. Depreciable Assets\n\nThis group includes tangible properties of relatively long life which are used in the operation of the business. However, natural resources such as oil or mineral lands are not included in this group of asset account. The following verification procedures should be undertaken on these accounts:\n\n1. Check the appropriateness of the costs recognized in the initial measurement of the asset. Validate if there are costs included in the initial recognition which should not be allowed.\n\n2. Compare the asset and related reserve amounts as they appear on the tax return, balance sheet, depreciation schedule, and taxpayer's books and other schedules. Compare the beginning and ending figures for the taxable year and reconcile differences or ask the taxpayer to make the necessary reconciliation. Verify the correctness of such reconciliation.\n\n3. Review depreciation schedule of fixed assets and ascertain propriety of depreciation expense claimed. Watch out for depreciation that may have been taken on assets which are already fully depreciated or charged off to expense.\n\n4. Review asset additions during the year by reference to invoices, contracts and other documents and determine if the proper cost basis was used.\n\na. Note items which appear to have originated from unusual sources such as appraisal increases, transfers and exchanges, and determine propriety thereof. Ascertain if prior earnings were adequate to cover acquisitions. DACcIH\n\nb. Determine if acquisition and installation costs of fixed costs of fixed assets and leasehold improvements have been capitalized.\n\nc. Ascertain if assets include items of a personal nature. If the assets are used by the officers for their personal use, the depreciation should be disallowed.\n\nd. Where construction or any other work of a capital nature is performed with the taxpayer's own labor, equipment and other assets for its own use, be certain that the basis of such asset includes materials, labor and overhead including depreciation.\n\ne. With regard to the basis of recognition of costs of assets, consider such items as trade-ins, acquisitions from related taxpayers, allocation of cost between land and building and other basis.\n\nf. Determine if increases in assets used in operation resulted to increased production and/or revenue.\n\n5. Note decrease in the asset accounts during the year. The accuracy of the gains or losses resulting therefrom should be verified and ascertained that the appropriate tax on the transaction such as value-added tax, if applicable, has been paid.\n\n6. On sale of real properties and/or other material disposition of asset, verify the actual amount of consideration received and determine any undeclared proceeds of sale and any tax (e.g., CGT, EWT) shouldered by the buyer which should form part of the selling price.\n\n7. Ascertain if the taxpayer has transferred assets to the owner, officers and stockholders or to a controlled domestic or foreign corporation for less than fair or adequate consideration.\n\n8. Check the terms of the lease agreement particularly on who shall shoulder the repairs and maintenance costs as well as leasehold improvements.\n\n9. Investigate if there are other affiliated companies who share in the usage of the leased property and estimate the allocable rent expense should have been charged to the affiliated companies.\n\nH. Allowances for Depreciation, Amortization and Other Valuation Reserves\n\n1. Review the nature and source of all accounts and ascertain if they are being used to claim unallowable deductions.\n\n2. With regard to depreciation, determine the correctness of the amount of asset being depreciated. No depreciation is allowable on the appraisal increase of fixed assets. Any foreseeable salvage value is to be deducted from the cost of the asset in determining the basis of depreciation.\n\na. No depreciation is allowable on a building until it is completed or on a machine until it is installed. Expenditures which are properly includible as an element of cost are freight-in, installation cost, title cost, and legal or brokerage fees in connection with acquisition.\n\nb. Where land and building are acquired on lump sum, the following formula should be used in computing the building cost for depreciation computation: HSCATc\n\nFMV or Zonal Value of land\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\nFMV or Zonal Value of Land and Building\n\nx\n\nTotal acquisition cost\n\n= COST OF LAND\n\nTotal acquisition cost (land and building)\n\nXXX\n\nLess: Cost of land per above computation\n\nXXX\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\n\nCOST OF BUILDING\n\nXXX\n\n=====\n\n3. Ascertain the taxpayer's depreciation and amortization policies and consider the following:\n\na. Whether the methods applied by the taxpayer are in compliance with the Tax Code, as amended, and existing revenue regulations;\n\nb. Whether the depreciation rates used by the taxpayer are fair and reasonable; and\n\nc. Whether the taxpayer has applied the same method consistently from period to period.\n\n4. Check authorization from minutes of meetings, fixed asset reports, or other supporting documents on credits for allowance for obsolescence and/or asset write-offs. If necessary, inspect assets claimed as obsolete and/or written off.\n\n5. If revaluation method is used for subsequent measurement, ascertain the accuracy of the revaluation made and cross-check to the revaluation surplus in the equity account or expense, whichever is applicable.\n\nI. Intangible Assets\n\n1. Investigate the nature of the intangible assets whether leases, patents, licenses, trademarks, goodwill, copyright, franchise and others.\n\n2. Cost of acquiring the intangible should be capitalized when useful lives can be estimated. If not, no amortization is allowable for tax purposes.\n\n3. Determine if the recorded cost and cost of current additions includes proper elements such as legal fees, application fees and other costs of acquisition. Examine contracts and other legal documents.\n\n4. Verify correctness of deductions claimed as amortization of intangible assets as follows:\n\na. Leasehold costs are subject to amortization over the term of the lease.\n\nb. Goodwill cannot be amortized if it is for an indefinite period of time.\n\nc. Research and Development expenditures may either be capitalized or treated as outright deductible expense.\n\nd. Patents sold with the exclusive right to make, use and sell an article constitute ordinary income.\n\ne. Organization expenses are subject to amortization and are not deductible in full on the year incurred. Check the reasonableness of the taxpayer's amortization policy on organization expense.\n\n5. Determine if there have been transactions with related taxpayers. If so, verify if these are made at arms-length.\n\n6. Determine if income applicable to intangibles has been included as income (e.g., subleases, overriding royalties, franchise and other sources).\n\n7. Analyze any transaction involving transfer of foreign rights to any foreign entity for an equity interest or for nominal consideration.\n\n8. Be alert to transactions which could have given rise to intangibles classifiable as asset account which may have been recorded as expense. IDTSEH\n\n9. Test the details associated with valuation and impairment of intangible asset.\n\nJ. Prepaid Expenses and Deferred Charges\n\n1. Verify the nature and source of these assets and the manner in which they are charge off to expense.\n\n2. When prepaid expenses are not reflected in the balance sheet, verify charges to expenses which entail advance payments such as insurance, rent, supplies, repairs and maintenance that are covered by contracts.\n\nK. Other Assets\n\n1. Obtain a schedule of other assets account when material in amount.\n\n2. Investigate sources of charges to the account. Verify entries and supporting documents to check if the other assets are results of income-generating activities not reported in the financial statements.\n\nL. Exchange, Clearing or Suspense Account\n\n1. Obtain a schedule to determine the nature and purpose of the account if significant in amount.\n\n2. Test check debit and credit entries, being aware of the possibility that such account may be used as a means for diverting sales, padding expenses, and concealing other irregularities.\n\nM. Current and Accrued Liabilities including Notes Payable\n\nThese liabilities are found on business records under various titles such as accounts payable, vouchers payable, notes payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities. The audit procedures are as follows:\n\n1. Reconcile subsidiary ledgers with the control accounts. Request the taxpayer for explanation of any discrepancies noted.\n\n2. Note existence of debit balances in the general ledger or subsidiary accounts. This may indicate diversion of funds and other underdeclaration of income. DaIAcC\n\n3. Note accounts which have long overdue balances. These may indicate contested liabilities or accounts that no longer exist such as unclaimed wages or unclaimed deposits which should be reverted to income.\n\n4. Review computation of year-end accruals with respect to their deductibility as expenses or purchases.\n\n5. Examine legitimacy of accounts payable to affiliates or related taxpayers. Test check payments made by tracing the same to supporting documents.\n\n6. Investigate entries in the general ledger control accounts. Check unusual items such as those that do not originate from the voucher register or disbursement book. This may disclose unreported income, improper claim or overstated expense.\n\n7. Be aware of any contingent liability by reviewing minutes of meetings and annual reports. Although this is not reflected in the tax return, an accrual may have been made for the item. Any claim for an expense or deduction arising from a contingent transaction shall not be considered as a deductible expense. A deductible expense must be reasonably determinable in amount and the liability must be fixed.\n\n8. If payables include liability on security deposits, secure a copy of the lease contract/agreement to determine provision on the application of lease deposits. These security deposits are taxable when received.\n\n9. For payroll, perform the following:\n\na. Observe payroll distributions;\n\nb. Examine payroll disbursements subsequent to year-end and compare with accrued payroll at the balance sheet date;\n\nc. Scrutinize the payroll registers for unusual items such as names of former employees, duplicate names and addresses, unusual pay rates, unusual number of hours and unusual bonuses and allowances; and\n\nd. Observe benefits that may be treated as \"Fringe benefits expense.\"\n\nN. Fixed Liabilities\n\n1. Review the Board of Directors' Minutes of the Meeting regarding whether new loan agreements or bond issuances are authorized.\n\n2. Acquaint with the pertinent provisions of loan contracts, mortgage agreements, certificates of indebtedness, financing arrangements and consider possible adjustment areas as follows:\n\na. Determination of expenses (e.g., interest and bank charges);\n\nb. Refunding of debt; and\n\nc. Legal, professional and other expense of issuance.\n\nAlso, note the principal, rate and length for loans to make sure the balance sheet shows the correct outstanding balance for each loan.\n\n3. Scrutinize any long term outstanding liability to the owner, shareholders and officers or to a related taxpayer as this may constitute accumulated unreported income.\n\n4. Examine and trace any large cash disbursements made.\n\n5. When the liability is secured by property pledged or mortgaged as collateral for the loan, determine if the property pledged/mortgaged is income producing. Review the terms and conditions stipulated on the loan agreement to determine if income derived therefrom remains to be reported by the taxpayer as the borrower.\n\n6. Verify if funds were borrowed for use of affiliates as the interest expenses thereon shall not be deductible on the part of the borrowing taxpayer. There should be a reallocation of profits and the tax burden must be shifted to the affiliate in accordance with existing rules and regulations.\n\n7. Determine whether the indebtedness will give rise to interest expense that is subject to limitations on deductibility under Section 34 (B) of the Tax Code, as amended. Determine if the loans were borrowed to finance acquisition of tax-exempt securities. If so, interest expense is not considered deductible for income tax purposes. TAacHE\n\nO. Deferred Credits\n\n1. Check all payments received as recorded in the cash receipts books (i.e., date of receipt, source of collection and other entries)\n\n2. Check if collections were included in the gross income during the year when the payments were actually received. Amounts are generally includible in gross income for tax purposes not later than the time of receipt if they are subject to free and unrestricted use by the taxpayer. Under this theory, collections, advance rentals, legal retainer and the like, advance sales of transportations tokens or communications tickets and other advances are income when received.\n\n3. Look for credit balance of accounts which fall under deferred credits. They may be clearly labeled as advanced rentals, deferred service income or may be shown as a reserve account that is mixed with true liability accounts, or as a contra-balance in the receivables.\n\n4. If the taxpayer used the completed contract method of accounting for contracts entered into and construction work that actually commenced prior to January 1, 1998, income and expenses attributable to a particular job or project are properly deferred until completion of the project. The contracts and progress reports should be inspected to determine whether the reporting of income has been delayed beyond the completion of the project.\n\n5. When a taxpayer uses the installment method of reporting income, the unrecognized gain for tax purposes should be recorded as a deferred credit. This particular account should be checked to determine if the year-end balance remaining in the account reconciles with gross profit to be reported on the subsequent payments. Any difference would indicate erroneous computations of income from payments.\n\n6. Obtain an understanding of the nature of the deferred income and other deferred credits' account, if material to overall financial statements, by conducting the following procedures:\n\na. Test computations of the current year activity by examining supporting documents;\n\nb. Determine if the method of amortization is consistent with the prior year; and\n\nc. Determine if the deferred credit balance at the balance sheet date is reasonable.\n\nP. Loans from Shareholders/Officers/Owners\n\n1. Determine whether there is a true debtor-creditor relationship. Excessively large liabilities in relation to capital stock (especially in the case of a new company) may indicate a thin capitalization situation.\n\n2. Check the financial statements of the corporation as well as that of the shareholders. If there is an interest expense account on the part of the corporation from such loan, there should also be a corresponding interest income account on the part of the shareholder.\n\nThere are certain tax advantages to the corporation or shareholder for an equity investment to be treated as a loan. Be sure that the taxpayer gets these benefits only when the facts of the case show that a \"true loan\" exists.\n\nIf \"loans\" are found to be equity capital, the following procedures may be applied:\n\na. Disallow claim for interest expense and treat payments during the year as dividends.\n\nb. Treat loan repayments as dividends.\n\nc. Disallow bad debts deductions by the shareholders.\n\n3. Check supporting loan documents issued in favor of the shareholders, officers or owners. If unsupported or if support is doubtful, the unreported income may have been lodged in this account.\n\n4. Verify certain payments of loans against check vouchers and cancelled checks. HDICSa\n\n5. Verify the debit and credit entries in the general ledger account and watch out for unusual sources other than the cash receipts and disbursement book.\n\n6. Examine adjustments, especially increases in the account, at the end of the year as this may constitute shifting of taxable income to this liability account. Verify journal entries, journal vouchers and related documents supporting the entries.\n\nQ. Capital Accounts\n\n1. Capital or Owner's Equity for sole proprietorship\n\na. Reconcile amount appearing on the books, tax return and financial statements. Verify discrepancies, if any.\n\nb. Review debits and credits to the account during the period under audit and check supporting entries to the account. Increases which originate from sources other than profit and loss may indicate omitted income.\n\nc. Relate the account balance and withdrawals with the owner's standard of living. Where owners report no other sources of income, and withdrawals appear insufficient to maintain personal living expenses, there may be underreporting or diversion of income.\n\n2. Partners' Capital for Partnerships\n\na. Review debits and credits to the account during the period under audit. Verify increases and decreases and check for unusual sources other than profit and loss.\n\nb. Reconcile amount appearing on the tax return, books and financial statements. Verify any differences noted.\n\nc. Examine pertinent provisions of partnership contract and check correctness of distribution of partnership income and expenses.\n\nd. Ascertain that the correct tax has been withheld on distribution of partnership profits.\n\ne. If the taxpayer claims that it is a general professional partnership, examine partnership contract and registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\n3. Stockholders' Equity for Corporations\n\na. Capital Stock\n\na.1 Review entries in the capital stock account and verify increases and decreases thereto. Also, examine by-laws, articles of incorporation or other documents, such as benefit plan documentation, stock register and stock certificate book, in support of other transactions affecting capital stock.\n\na.2 Examine stock register to gather information on the identity of shareholders, their contact information and the amount of shares each shareholder owns.\n\na.3 Verify correctness of all items appearing on the return, books and financial statements. Investigate discrepancies, if any. In the process of verification:\n\na.3.1 Make sure any unissued stock certificates per stock register are present and accounted for in the stock certificate book which should contain all unissued and cancelled stock certificates;\n\na.3.2 Trace shares of stock issued per stock register to the stock certificate book; and\n\na.3.3 Compare the number of shares issued to that reflected in the financial statements. IDaEHC\n\na.4 Reconcile control account balance with subsidiary information on shareholders' capital in the stock register and transfer book and other related records.\n\na.5 In case of additions to capital stock out of new issuance during the period under audit, ascertain that the correct amount of documentary stamp tax has been paid. Secure a photocopy of the proof of payment.\n\na.6 Compare data from minute book and other records mentioned above with items recorded on the books of accounts to determine if entries have been made.\n\na.7 Check the existence and valuation of treasury account by performing the following procedures:\n\na.7.1 Check the minutes of the Board of Directors meeting if there is authorization to purchase the company's own stock;\n\na.7.2 Check whether the company uses par-value method or cost method in accounting for purchase and resale of treasury stocks since it is significant in the valuation of the treasury stock as a reduction to stockholder's equity;\n\na.7.3 Examine if the company has recognized any gains and/or losses in treasury stock transactions since per generally accepted accounting principles, recording any gains and/or losses on the said transactions is not appropriate; and\n\na.7.4 To verify the existence of repurchased shares, check surrendered stock certificates which may be defaced by the company thru punched holes in the certificate, stamped \"cancelled\" or drawn with a big X across the certificate.\n\na.8 Determine if expenses relating to stock issuance (i.e., legal fees, registration fees, broker's commission and other expenses) have been properly handled, recorded and reflected in the financial statements as well as in the tax returns.\n\na.9 Determine during the examination of a recapitalization of the stock in a closely held company, if the fair market value of the stock or bond to be received by each exchanging stockholder is equal to the fair market value of the stock surrendered in the exchange. If there is a significant difference, consider the possibility of treating the difference as a donation subject to donor's tax to the corporation or to the stockholder, whoever received the lesser value.\n\na.10 If a reorganization has taken place, examine the following documents:\n\na.10.1 The reorganization plan;\n\na.10.2 Journal entries giving effect to direct reorganization; DTCSHA\n\na.10.3 Notes of all minute book referring to the transaction; and\n\na.10.4 Notes of pertinent information from the correspondence file with other parties to the reorganization.\n\na.11 Determine if the increase in capital stock is the direct consequence of an exchange of property under Section 40 (C) (2) of the Tax Code, as amended. If so, confirm compliance with the conditions set for the non-recognition of gain or loss by performing the following audit procedures:\n\na.11.1 In case of merger or consolidation\n\ni. Verify if the plan of reorganization has been adopted by each of the parties to the reorganization.\n\nii. Check if the income tax return filed for the taxable year in which the exchange took place incorporated all facts pertinent to the non-recognition of gain or loss upon such exchange, such as:\n\no The historical cost or other basis of valuation of all properties, including all stocks or securities transferred incident to the plan; and\n\no The nature and amount of liability assumed upon the exchange and the amount and nature of any liabilities to which any of the property acquired in the exchange is subject.\n\niii. Verify Deed of Assignment of property for share of stocks; and\n\niv. Check if the required documentary stamp tax has been paid.\n\na.11.2 In case of transfer of property to a controlled corporation\n\ni. Verify if the transferor and the transferee filed an income tax return for the taxable year in which the exchange was consummated with a complete statement of all facts pertinent to the exchange.\n\nii. Verify Deed of Assignment of the property.\n\niii. Determine if transferor of the property gains control of said corporation, alone or together with others, not exceeding four (4) persons, pursuant to Section 40 (C) (2) of the NIRC.\n\niv. Determine if the documentary stamp tax was paid.\n\na.11.3 In both cases, ascertain if the following information have been annotated at the back of the Transfer Certificates of Title or certificates of stock: CScTED\n\ni. Date of execution of the deed of exchange;\n\nii. The original or historical cost of property; and\n\niii. The fact that no gain or loss was recognized as a result of such exchange.\n\na.11.4 Retained Earnings\n\nThe investigation of the retained earnings (or deficit, in case of accumulated losses) is a very important part of the audit process as this is related to the net worth method of investigation. It is the account to which the net income or net loss from operations is transferred and accumulated into. The minimum audit procedures that should be undertaken in analyzing this account are as follows:\n\ni. Compare the amount of earnings retained in the business as shown on the return, financial statements, books of accounts and the schedule of reconciliation of net income per books and per return. Verify differences, if any.\n\nii. Verify correctness of all items, both increases and decreases, appearing on the books, financial statements or return. Trace beginning balance of retained earnings to the ending balance appearing in the balance sheet of the prior period. If possible, get a schedule or a reconciliation showing the changes from the beginning to ending retained earnings for the year under audit.\n\niii. Check increases which do not originate from net income. Verify entries from the general journal/journal vouchers, especially those recorded other than as year-end adjustments as these may indicate sales or income directly posted to the retained earnings account.\n\niv. Determine if declared and unpaid dividends are properly recorded. Compare paid dividends to the minutes of the Board of Directors meeting(s).\n\nv. Verify cash or stock dividends as well as any other type of dividends as to its existence as well as its proper recording in the books and imposition of withholding tax.\n\nvi. For taxpayer incurring continuous losses and deficit balance, investigate the real status of the business. Tour company premises, evaluate the volume of business, and compare the information gathered from external sources with the financial data reported. There may be underreporting of sales as there is very little reason for a business to exist if it is continuously incurring losses.\n\nvii. Examine supporting documents and authorization for all other debit and credit transactions in retained earnings to determine conformity with existing laws and regulations.\n\nviii. Examine documents relating to appropriations of retained earnings. Trace it to retained earnings account.\n\nix. Investigate and confirm if prior-period adjustments are indeed errors that can be corrected by making an adjustment to retained earnings. Compute any effect of taxable income and corresponding taxes.\n\nx. Investigate a possible imposition of Improperly Accumulated Earnings Tax (IAET) by performing the following audit procedures:\n\no Make sure that the company is not one of the following:\n\n\u2022 Publicly-held corporations;\n\n\u2022 Banks and other non-bank financial intermediaries;\n\n\u2022 Insurance companies;\n\n\u2022 Taxable partnerships;\n\n\u2022 General professional partnerships;\n\n\u2022 Tax-exempt joint ventures;\n\n\u2022 Economic zones under special tax rate; and ISHaCD\n\n\u2022 Philippine branch of a multinational company.\n\nThe above mentioned corporations and/or partnerships are exempted from the imposition of 10% IAET.\n\no Examine if the Retained Earnings account is more than 100% of its paid-up capitalization. However, do not include the additional paid-in capital as part of the paid-up capitalization in determining what is considered as unjustifiable accumulation of earnings beyond the reasonable needs of the business.\n\no Inspect Board of Directors Minute Book to prove appropriations for future use in retained earnings account.\n\nX. AUDIT OF INCOME AND EXPENSES\n\nThis chapter discusses the books of accounts, accounting records and documents used to record income and expense transactions. It enumerates the audit procedures and techniques for income and expenses.\n\nThe audit of income or revenues is applicable to resident and non-resident individuals engaged in business and the practice of profession, estates and trusts engaged in trade or business, general professional and business partnerships and corporations.\n\nExpenses chargeable against income are allowable in their entirety only for business partnerships and corporations. Self-employed resident citizens and aliens engaged in business or the practice of profession, non-resident aliens engaged in business, estates and trusts engaged in trade or business and general professional partnerships as defined under Section 22 (B) of the Tax Code and their individual partners can claim expenses subject to the provisions of Section 34 of the Tax Code.\n\nThe subsequent discussions on the procedures and techniques in the investigation of income and expense accounts are general audit guidelines. The RO should not be hindered in applying additional procedures and techniques, which he deems necessary, based on his initial findings, evaluation of internal control, reliability of accounting records, and analytical review of operations.\n\nA. Audit of Income Accounts\n\n1. Sales\n\na. Review the taxpayer's accounting method of revenue recognition if the same is acceptable and consistent with prior years.\n\nb. Determine if sales are properly recorded by checking the Cash Deposit Report (CDR). Check the date; compare the gross total of CDR against the gross total generated by the Point-of-Sale (POS) system. Verify footings.\n\nc. Determine if cash sales are deposited the next banking day based on deposit slip's validation and compare against the entries made per CDR.\n\nd. Ascertain that all sales were reported as of the cut-off date. Cut-off refers to the point at which entries from one accounting period stops and entries for the next period begin. This is usually the last day of a taxable year. If the last day of the taxable year is not used, the cut-off date must be the last day of the taxpayer's fiscal period. cDTACE\n\ne. Verify revenues/sales recorded and deposited near the end of the taxable year and immediately during the subsequent month to determine if these pertain to income earned for the taxable year under examination.\n\nf. Account for all sales invoices/official receipts issued. Check if there is any gap in the series used for the period. It is to be noted that cancelled invoices must also be presented to be proven cancelled. Match delivery receipts, gate passes, if any, against sales invoices issued.\n\ng. Review purchase orders, customer orders or bill of ladings to reconcile them with the sales invoices issued. Investigate discrepancies to uncover fraud and theft.\n\nh. Trace from shipping document entries to sales journal to reveal shipped items without sales recorded.\n\ni. Compute totals of sales invoices/official receipts, sales summary, entries in subsidiary sales journals and general ledger accounts. Inquire and investigate discrepancies between book entries and returns filed.\n\nj. Reconcile credits to sales with debits to accounts receivable and debit to cash receipts book. Test and check monthly entries.\n\nk. Research unusual and unfamiliar issuances of goods or goods which are not normally sold by the taxpayer.\n\nl. Conduct interviews to secure information regarding the taxpayer's business, financial history, number of employees and other information which may lead to sales information.\n\nm. Determine inventory method applied if acceptable and consistently followed.\n\nn. Determine if merchandise is being withdrawn for personal use or for any other purpose not in relation to normal sales process.\n\no. Scan credit memo issued to customers and test check entries to Sales Returns & Allowances and Sales Discounts to ensure proper recording of credits.\n\np. Verify, cancelled sales invoices by test checking deposits made and withdrawal of goods on the day of cancellation.\n\nq. Tour the business premises to obtain information on:\n\nq.1 sales volume;\n\nq.2 volume of sales return and method of handling sales returns;\n\nq.3 major products;\n\nq.4 other by-products and scrap sales, if any;\n\nq.5 equipment used in operation; cCHITA\n\nq.6 nature, quality and size of facilities; and\n\nq.7 inventory level.\n\nIn touring the premises, be observant and ask questions that will disclose significant facts and information relative to the taxpayer's business operations.\n\nr. Review sales contracts, consignment agreements and other documents relative to sales.\n\ns. On installment sales, ascertain that collections have been properly segregated as to the year of sales and that the proper gross profit ratios have been applied. Review unearned or deferred income accounts for any uncollected balances which have been outstanding for an unreasonable period of time.\n\nt. Determine whether sales on consigned goods are taken up at the time of shipment or after sixty (60) days from the date goods were consigned.\n\nu. Where the internal control is weak and records are unreliable or inadequate, apply other approaches to audit revenue such as cash analysis, net worth analysis, third party verification, and other indirect approaches investigation.\n\n2. Rent Income\n\na. Obtain and review copies of lease contracts/agreements.\n\nb. Conduct ocular inspection of the premises under lease. Identify tenants and monthly or annual rentals. Conduct interview, if necessary.\n\nc. Relate real properties under lease agreement to assets declared in the balance sheet. Note inconsistencies between asset values and income generated. DETACa\n\nd. Where the rental income is based on a percentage of sales of the lessee, the sales of the lessee should be tested for a representative period, say one month, to get a proper approximation of the lessee's sales during the taxable year under audit and the rental income received by the lessor. In such cases, proper authorization from the lessee should be obtained before conducting the test verification.\n\ne. Obtain information on rental of neighboring properties and compare with rent income reported.\n\nf. Examine official receipts issued. Compare total collections per official receipts with entries in the cash receipts book and general ledger. Investigate discrepancies.\n\ng. Ascertain acceptability and consistency of accounting methods used. For cash-basis taxpayers, prepaid rent and rental deposits constitute income during the year of receipt.\n\nh. Take note of lease contracts which are actually conditional sales.\n\ni. When necessary, obtain copies of Transfer Certificates of Title, tax declarations, mayor's or municipal permits, and real property tax receipts to determine properties which may be undisclosed/unrecorded by the taxpayer.\n\n3. Professional Fees\n\na. Determine the taxpayer's accounting method of recognizing income, whether cash or accrual. Most professionals, however, adopt the cash basis of accounting.\n\nb. Examine contracts with clients and other correspondence/documents (logbooks, etc.) in relation to professional services rendered.\n\nc. Compare income reported on the tax return with the books of accounts, creditable withholding tax forms, financial statements and official receipts issued. Verify discrepancies, noted, if any.\n\nd. Account for official receipts issued. Note any missing receipt or break in the series and investigate the reasons therefore. If taxpayer claims it to be cancelled, request for the physical document.\n\ne. Analyze the reasonableness of expenses claimed in relation to income declared.\n\nf. Analyze the increase/decrease ratio of the sales for the year from previous year.\n\ng. Conduct interviews and third party verification, if necessary.\n\nh. Relate the income reported per tax return to the lifestyle and assets of the taxpayer. If the taxpayer's assets and estimated costs of living expenses are beyond the income earned, verify and compute for possible underdeclaration of income by using the net worth method of investigation.\n\n4. Income from Sale of Asset\n\na. Identify in the tax returns and financial statements any sale, exchange or disposal of assets other than inventories or stocks in trade. Sale or disposal can usually be assumed when there is a \"Gain/loss on sale of property\" or \"Proceeds from sale of property\" in the Statement of Cash Flows or in the Notes to Financial Statement. TaDCEc\n\nb. Obtain copies of deeds of sale and other documents relating to the sale, if there is any.\n\nc. Determine zonal values, fair market values or appraisal values and compare with the actual selling price.\n\nd. Compute any underdeclaration of sales by comparing the selling price with the existing fair market value, zonal value or value of similar properties sold.\n\ne. In case of disposal of capital assets, ascertain compliance with the provision of the Tax Code, as amended, on capital gains and losses.\n\nf. Verify sales of property reported on the installment basis and determine if all requirements pertaining thereto have been complied with.\n\ng. Determine if proper accounting for depreciation, book value and salvage value was correctly taken up.\n\nh. Inquire from certain company personnel on possible sales of assets which may not have been recorded in the books of accounts.\n\ni. If possible, tour the premises where properties and equipment are kept and inspect if there are properties still recognized as asset but are not physically in the location, which could signify disposal.\n\n5. Other Income\n\na. If not enumerated in the Notes to Financial Statements, request for a breakdown of the \"Other Income.\"\n\nb. Scrutinize the entries in the general ledger and general journal for any other income or other receivables recorded thereto.\n\nc. Test check entries in inter-company accounts to determine whether shifting of income or management fees may have been made and charged to affiliates.\n\nd. Investigate suspense accounts and unusual liability accounts, such as due to affiliates/due to stockholders and other payables to uncover possible income not recorded in the income accounts.\n\ne. Clarify the nature of unusual items reported as Other Income.\n\nf. If there are investments, obtain a list of investments made by the company and test-check if the income on the said investments are verified and accrued on a timely basis.\n\ng. Test accrued interest and interests earned during the period on receivables and determine whether interest should be imputed on long-term receivables arising during the period.\n\nB. Audit of Expense Accounts\n\n1. Purchases\n\nFor taxpayers engaged in trading and manufacturing businesses, the purchase account is one of the largest accounts in the income statement. Thus, there is a possibility that taxpayers may hide a number of non-deductible expenditures in this account due to the volume of transactions posted to it. cDEHIC\n\nThe following audit procedures should be followed in examining purchases:\n\na. Account for all purchase invoices and receiving reports as of the cut-off date. Determine if year-end purchases have been recorded in the proper accounting period.\n\nb. Review purchase orders and match it to the invoices. Reconcile any discrepancies.\n\nc. Compare totals or purchases in the return, income statement, purchase book, subsidiary purchases book, if any, and general ledger. Determine any discrepancy and investigate its nature as well as the nature of year-end adjustments.\n\nd. Determine that the purchases declared are neither overstated nor understated by vouching the supporting documents, and test checking the footings of invoices, purchase books and ledger accounts. Understatement of purchases may also mean under declared sales.\n\ne. Upon vouching, check for purchases of items not related to the product manufactured as it may only be lodged in the purchase account.\n\nf. Tour the premises where inventory items are kept and correlate actual inventory level against purchases reported. Test check stock cards of major inventory items to evaluate accuracy of inventory reports.\n\ng. Scan the purchases book for possible unusual payees or unusual amount of purchases. Take note of suppliers not generally associated with the products or services handled by the taxpayer.\n\nh. Verify entries in the general ledger account which originate from unusual sources such as journal entries, debit and credit memoranda and other accounting records.\n\ni. Test check recorded purchases for a representative period with suppliers' invoices and cancelled checks. For efficiency, it may be best to vouch big ticket suppliers for it can represent the bulk purchase. Note if there are personal expenditures, withdrawals of merchandise by the owners, fictitious or duplicate invoices, cancelled purchase invoices, excessive rebates, discounts and allowances and purchases not received.\n\nj. Where there are only a few major suppliers, conduct third party verification to ascertain the correctness of purchases declared, if there is suspicion of fraud or if the RO believes that this is necessary. ISCDEA\n\nk. Obtain pre-processed data, such as the Summary Lists of Purchases and Importations by the taxpayer under audit and the Summary of Sales by the taxpayer's supplier and verify if the reported purchases of the taxpayer under audit match with those declared in the summary lists. In case of discrepancies, investigate secondary evidence such as paid checks, check vouchers or bank debit advice to prove payment for purchases.\n\nl. If purchases are from suppliers related to the owners or from affiliates, conduct a review of a number of transactions to uncover prices in excess of market value, excessive rebates and allowances, and other similar schemes.\n\nm. Identify variations in rates of items purchased over a period of time. Any rate variation must be properly justified.\n\n2. Cost of Goods Sold\n\na. Verify the inventory valuation method applied by the taxpayer whether first-in, first-out (FIFO), specific identification, weighted average or simple average. Last-in, first-out is not acceptable for income tax purposes. Determine consistency of application of the acceptable valuation method from year to year.\n\nb. Obtain an understanding of the production process thru familiarization with the taxpayer's business, tour of the premises, conducting interviews, and analyzing cost of production reports.\n\nc. Compare inventory balances in the return under examination with the balances for the prior and subsequent years' returns, and reconcile these with the general ledger and the physical inventory summary.\n\nd. Check unauthorized changes in inventory valuation method from period to period. Conduct test checking of inventory valuation of sample inventory items from the summary inventory sheets and determine if the taxpayer has not improperly valued any inventory item.\n\ne. Check gross profit variations. Any significant variation should be discussed with the taxpayer and a reasonable explanation in writing should be obtained. A material decrease in gross profit from one year to the next could be due to understated ending inventory.\n\nf. Determine the significance of notes or qualifying statements on financial reports prepared by external auditors. Any unusual comments or qualifying statements about the inventories or cost of sales that have a material tax effect should be discussed with the taxpayer and, if necessary, with a representative of the external auditor.\n\ng. If the taxpayer applies standard or predetermined cost in costing goods manufactured, inspect the working papers and production report used to calculate the cost per unit and ensure that expenses included are allowable.\n\nh. Analyze unusual entries to cost of sales. Account for labor, materials and overhead charges not directly related to sales or transfers of finished goods. Be alert on the possibility that the taxpayer may be trying to include a non-deductible item in the cost of sales account.\n\ni. Determine whether year-end purchases are included in closing inventory. Review purchase invoices at the last month of the taxable year under audit. Compare quantities on the inventory summary for classes of goods purchased with the quantity in the ending inventory list and quantity of sales recorded at year-end for such goods. Thus, if a specific item or a certain quantity of goods were purchased on the last day of the year, it should be included in the ending inventory unless sold that same day. EDCTIa\n\nj. Determine reductions in ending inventory values by reviewing authorization for write-downs and provision for obsolescence or decline in market values as well as theft and/or spoilage. Check minutes of meetings for such authorization. Analyze journal entries for the write-down or provision of allowance for obsolescence/decline in value. Check itemized inventory summary sheet and test-check the list with actual physical inventory.\n\nk. Review for gross profit variations. Compare and apply analytics to see if there are any significant variations \u2014 either overall or by product line with prior and subsequent years.\n\n3. Salaries, Wages and Other Employees' Benefits\n\na. Evaluate the expense initially by comparing the ratio of salaries and wages to sales and the percentage of taxes withheld to total salaries, allowances, bonuses and other compensation. Low ratios might indicate that the company hires sub-contractors or an understatement of expenses which may be a lead to underdeclared sales. High ratios may also mean an understatement of sales or padded payroll with fictitious or terminated employees.\n\nb. Review payroll sheets. All expenses claimed having the semblance of a compensation payment should be verified together.\n\nc. Interview personnel assigned to prepare payroll and inquire if family members are included in the payroll. If so, check legitimacy of the work assignment and reasonableness of compensation paid.\n\nd. Compare payroll costs with industry standards and other independent data. Require explanations for significant deviations.\n\ne. Observe the actual number of employees and relate this to the declared sales. Inquire if independent contractors are hired in lieu of regular employees.\n\nf. To make sure no terminated employees are being paid, select a sample of taxpayer's terminated employees and trace them back to the payroll register.\n\ng. Check if there are proper cutoffs by testing accruals.\n\nh. Perform a comparative analysis of salaries, wages and other employee benefits with prior and subsequent years. Material changes may indicate a change in the volume of business or in the policy of classifying manpower employed.\n\ni. Determine if the taxpayer is properly withholding the correct amount of taxes on compensation by test checking actual pay slips against employee records and BIR Form 1604 CF (Annual Information Return of Taxes Withheld on Compensation and Withholding Taxes). ADCIca\n\nj. Reconcile totals of wages paid which were subjected to withholding tax and totals of compensation paid which were not subjected to withholding tax with payroll expense claimed. Consider the possibility of disallowing any noted discrepancy.\n\nk. Verify Social Security System Premium Remittance List to cross check the list of employees to whom compensation was paid.\n\nl. Verify if the 13th month pay, as well as all the benefits and bonuses paid or accrued exceeding the exempt threshold, were properly taxed.\n\n4. Fringe Benefits\n\nFringe benefits tax is a final withholding tax imposed on the grossed-up monetary value of fringe benefits furnished, granted or paid by the employer to the employee, except rank and file employees as defined in RR No. 11-2018.\n\na. Obtain a list of managerial and supervisory employees from the Human Resource or Personnel Department of the company being audited with the following information per personnel:\n\na.1 nationality;\n\na.2 citizenship;\n\na.3 number of years with the company;\n\na.4 position/job designation;\n\na.5 basic salary and allowances; and\n\na.6 other compensation and benefits.\n\nb. Secure copies of employment contracts and/or appointment papers and examine these documents to verify the nature and amount of other compensation, allowances and benefits which may be subject to fringe benefits tax. ScaCEH\n\nc. Analyze expenses and other pertinent accounts where fringe benefits may have been lodged or recorded. Determine the amounts of benefits subject to tax.\n\nd. Include the value of the following items/services as taxable fringe benefits:\n\nd.1 Housing;\n\nd.2 Expense account;\n\nd.3 Vehicle of any kind;\n\nd.4 Household personnel, such as maid, driver and others;\n\nd.5 Interest on loan at less than market rate to the extent of the difference between the market rate and actual rate granted;\n\nd.6 Membership fees, dues and other expenses borne by the employer for the employee in social and athletic clubs or other similar organizations;\n\nd.7 Expenses for foreign travel;\n\nd.8 Holiday and vacation expenses;\n\nd.9 Educational assistance to the employee or his dependents; and\n\nd.10 Life or health insurance and other non-life insurance premiums or similar amounts in excess of allowable amount under the law.\n\ne. Exclude the following fringe benefits from the fringe benefits subject to Fringe Benefits Tax:\n\ne.1 Fringe benefits which are authorized and exempted from tax under the Tax Code, as amended, or under any special law;\n\ne.2 Contributions of the employer for the benefit of the employee to retirement, insurance and hospitalization benefit plans;\n\ne.3 Benefits given to the rank and file employees, whether or not granted under a collective bargaining agreement;\n\ne.4 If the grant of the fringe benefits is for the convenience of the employer; and\n\ne.5 De Minimis benefits, subject to prescribed thresholds, such as:\n\ne.5.1 Monetized unused vacation leave credits of private employees not exceeding ten (10) days during the year; TIEHDC\n\ne.5.2 Monetized value of vacation and sick leave credits paid to government officials and employees;\n\ne.5.3 Medical cash allowance to dependents of employees, not exceeding threshold provided in the existing regulations;\n\ne.5.4 Rice subsidy provided in the existing regulations;\n\ne.5.5 Uniform and clothing allowance not exceeding threshold provided in the existing regulations;\n\ne.5.6 Actual medical assistance, e.g., medical allowance to cover medical and healthcare needs, annual medical/executive check-up, maternity assistance, and routine consultations allowed under existing regulations;\n\ne.5.7 Laundry allowance per month allowed under existing regulations;\n\ne.5.8 Employee achievement awards (e.g., for the length of service or safety achievement) which must be in the form of a tangible personal property other than cash or gift certificate, with an annual monetary value allowed under existing regulations;\n\ne.5.9 Gifts given during Christmas and major anniversary celebrations allowed under existing regulations;\n\ne.5.10 Daily meal allowance for overtime work and night/graveyard shift allowed under existing regulations; and\n\ne.5.11 Benefits received by an employee by virtue of a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) and productivity incentive schemes provided that the total monetary value received from both CBA and productivity incentive schemes combined do not exceed the threshold allowed under existing regulations.\n\nf. Determine the correct valuation of fringe benefits based on the provisions on valuation prescribed and illustrated in existing revenue issuances.\n\ng. Compute for the amount of taxable fringe benefits by dividing the monetary value of the fringe benefit by 68%.\n\nh. Compute for the correct final withholding tax on fringe benefits by multiplying the grossed up monetary value of the benefits with 35%. However, for a non-resident alien individual not engaged in trade or business within the Philippines, the grossed up monetary value shall be multiplied by 25%.\n\ni. Examine monthly final withholding tax returns with corresponding official receipts of payment to check if the correct final withholding tax on fringe benefits was paid. In case of non-withholding, non-remittance or late payment, compute the deficiency tax dues and/or penalties, where applicable.\n\nj. Compare the amount of fringe benefits per income tax return, audited financial statements and per books against withholding tax returns and official receipts. If the taxpayer is on accrual basis, examine the journal entry made in accruing expense at the end of the year. Verify if the tax has been paid on or before the due date on the first month of the following year.\n\nk. Disallow claims for fringe benefits in excess of supported amounts or where the payees are determined to be fictitious, or when the prescribed fringe benefits tax has not been paid. ACcaET\n\n2. [n]Rents\n\na. Check for the official receipts pertaining to the leased property.\n\nb. Verify pertinent provisions of the lease contract with the lessor and check if the terms are being properly followed.\n\nc. Verify the reasonableness of rentals paid by the lessee, particularly if the lessor is related directly to the taxpayer.\n\nd. Verify whether the taxpayer is renting property for which it has no actual business use. Any rentals in that case would be unreasonable and unnecessary; hence, the expense should be disallowed.\n\ne. Determine the terms of the lease. If the lessee may take or acquire title to the property, the claim for rental expense should be disallowed.\n\nf. Determine if there are any capital expenditures included in the accounts.\n\ng. Determine whether the proper amount of expanded withholding tax on rental payments has been withheld and remitted by verifying BIR Form 1604E and all the paid BIR Forms 1601E.\n\nh. In case the lessor is a non-resident foreign corporation or owner, the VAT on sale of services and use or lease of properties in the Philippines shall be based on the contract price agreed upon by the lessor and the lessee. The lessee shall be responsible for the payment of VAT on the said rental on behalf of the non-resident foreign corporation or owner.\n\n3. Royalties\n\na. Verify minute book and pertinent provisions of the contract stipulating the basis and the terms of royalty payments.\n\nb. Check correctness of the amount of the expense by computing the percentage of royalty or terms specified in the contract in relation to the reported sales. Disallow excess claim.\n\nc. Determine whether the proper amount of final withholding tax has been withheld and remitted.\n\nd. In case the licensor is a non-resident foreign corporation or owner, the VAT on sale of services and use or lease of properties in the Philippines shall be based on the contract price agreed upon by the licensor and the licensee. The licensee shall be responsible for the payment of VAT on the said royalties on behalf of the non-resident foreign corporation or owner.\n\ne. If the recipient is a non-resident alien or foreign entity, determine whether the proper amount of tax has been withheld and remitted.\n\ne.1 Check whether the recipient is a treaty country resident. If so, ask for a copy of a ruling issued for the use of the preferential tax rate.\n\ne.2 If a copy of a ruling has been produced, verify from the issuing BIR office the authenticity of such ruling.\n\ne.3 If the recipient is a non-treaty country resident, verify if the appropriate tax rate provided for in the Tax Code, as amended, is properly applied. SaIEcA\n\n4. Interest\n\na. Verify sources of interest expenses such as actual notes, loans, and mortgage or bonds instruments. Check whether the indebtedness is business related.\n\nb. Determine the accounting method used by the taxpayer for if it uses accrual basis, only the interest accruing during the taxable year is deductible.\n\nc. Perform vouching to bank advices by tracing the amount of interest reflected on bank advices to the amount stated in the General Ledger account.\n\nd. Determine if interest paid or accrued applies to obligations due to related taxpayers. Consider such items as:\n\nd.1 Arm's length features\n\nd.1.1 Bona fide obligations; and\n\nd.1.2 Interest in excess of the prevailing rates in unrelated transactions.\n\nd.2 Accrual of items payable to related taxpayers which are not paid within the prescribed time limit. IaHDcT\n\ne. Determine if deductions claimed relate to interest incurred in carrying tax free obligations. If so, then the interest claimed is not deductible.\n\nf. Disallow interest claimed in excess of interest income subject to final tax.\n\ng. Determine if the interest deduction includes any principal amount.\n\nh. If the recipient is a non-resident alien or other foreign entity, determine if the proper amount of tax has been withheld. (Follow procedures in item e.3 under item number 3 of royalties).\n\ni. Ascertain if the loans acquired were not utilized but were loaned out to affiliates. If so, disallow interest expense claimed.\n\n5. Taxes\n\na. Verify whether only the taxes properly paid or accrued during the year have been claimed.\n\nb. Determine that no protested taxes or reserves for deficiency taxes upon audit are claimed.\n\nc. Determine existence of claims for taxes not allowable as deduction such as:\n\nc.1 Income tax provided for under the Tax Code, as amended;\n\nc.2 Income, war profits and excess profits taxes imposed by authority of any foreign country;\n\nc.3 Estate and gift taxes; and\n\nc.4 Taxes assessed against local benefits of a kind tending to increase the value of the property assessed.\n\nd. Determine if the taxpayer is the owner of the real and personal property being taxed.\n\ne. Determine if there are any taxes on the purchase of capital assets that were already capitalized but also charged to expense account, which should be disallowed.\n\n6. Repairs\n\na. Determine depreciation policy of the taxpayer. A conservative depreciation policy often contemplates a high degree of current repair expenditures.\n\nb. Verify nature of expenditures. If the expenditure prolongs the life or enhances the value of the existing assets, then it is not deductible but should be capitalized and depreciated over the years of their estimated usefulness.\n\nc. Check repair accounts for the possibility that personal expenses of owners or other company officers and employees are included. Look for repair/maintenance tickets as issued by the company's division handling the repairs.\n\n7. Bad debts\n\na. Obtain and review list of charged-off or written-off accounts.\n\nb. Bad debts prior to being written off require approval must be sought and compared to actual written off accounts. DEIHAa\n\nc. Determine with a reasonable degree of certainty the uncollectibility of the debt.\n\nd. Determine if the charge-off or written-off is based on worthlessness of the debt within the year.\n\ne. Determine if there are repossessed merchandise. If so, verify if the value of the repossessed merchandise has been correctly assigned and deducted from the claimed amount of bad debts.\n\nf. Verify losses on installment receivable if consideration on any repossessed merchandise has been taken into account and if portion of the losses had been charged to the unrealized gross profit account. SDTIaE\n\ng. Determine if the method of deducting bad debts is acceptable and consistent with the method applied in the preceding year.\n\nh. Verify bad debts expense in relation to the examination of the allowance for doubtful accounts.\n\ni. Determine the reasonableness of the allowance for bad debts taking the allowance set for the previous years into consideration.\n\n8. Losses\n\na. Abandonment and Demolition Losses\n\na.1 Verify if the amount of the abandonment loss is the adjusted basis of the abandoned asset.\n\na.2 Determine if the loss really occurred within the taxable year.\n\na.3 Determine if the retirement or abandonment loss is specifically allowable under the taxpayer's method of accounting for depreciable property.\n\na.4 Determine the reason for the demolition of a building. If it was the taxpayer's intention to demolish the building when the property was first acquired, abandonment loss is not allowable. It should form part of the cost of the new building.\n\nb. Losses from Casualty or Theft\n\nCasualty loss refers to loss of property connected with trade or business. In the verification of casualty or theft losses, the following pointers should be observed:\n\nb.1 Ascertain that a loss has actually been incurred by examining supporting documents such as police report or report of the fire department.\n\nb.2 Ascertain that the loss is claimed in the proper year. Generally, casualty loss is claimed in the year incurred while losses from theft or embezzlement are claimed in the year discovered.\n\nb.3 Ascertain that insurance proceeds or claims, salvage proceeds, or salvage value have been properly taken into account.\n\nb.4 Ascertain that the adjusted basis of lost property has been properly computed. Consider reasonableness of values used in the computation and ascertain that the loss claimed does not exceed the adjusted basis.\n\nb.5 Ascertain that the rule as to the manner of deductibility have been complied with (type of asset, whether insured or not, time or period held, and other relevant factors.)\n\nb.6 In cases involving loss of cash, be alert on the possibility that the cash stolen may not have been previously included as income.\n\nb.7 Trace handling of losses involving inventory or stock in trade to preclude double claim of deduction. AacCIT\n\nb.8 Analyze any loss claimed for assets located in a foreign country.\n\nb.9 Verify police blotters, fire department records and other independent documents in support of the claim.\n\nc. Net Operating Loss Carry-Over (NOLCO)\n\nPursuant to Section 34 (D) (3) of the Tax Code, as amended, \"net operating loss\" means the excess of allowable deduction over the gross income of the business in a taxable year.\n\nThe validity of the claim for NOLCO may be determined through the following procedures:\n\nc.1 Secure copies of income tax returns and the applicable audited financial statements for the three (3) consecutive taxable years immediately preceding the year of claim.\n\nc.2 Verify audit reports, if any, covering the taxable years with net operating loss to ascertain correctness of amount claimed after audit. If the results of audit for prior years show a net income instead of a loss, disallow claim for NOLCO.\n\nc.3 Determine if the net loss was incurred during the taxable year in which the taxpayer was exempt from income tax. If so, the NOLCO should not be allowed as a deduction for the succeeding period.\n\nc.4 Examine the taxpayer's stock and transfer book and report submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission to ascertain that there is no substantial change in the ownership of the business or enterprise in that:\n\ni. Not less than seventy-five percent (75%) in nominal value of outstanding issued shares, if the business is in the name of a corporation, is held by or on behalf of the same persons; or\n\nii. Not less than seventy-five percent (75%) of the paid up capital of the corporation, if the business, is in the name of a corporation, is held by or on behalf of the same persons.\n\nc.5 For operators of mines, other than oil and gas wells, which did not avail of the Investments under E.O. 226, otherwise known as the Omnibus Investments [n] Code of 1987, as amended, verify correctness of claim for net operating loss as follows:\n\ni. Refer to audited financial statements and audit reports to check if the net loss was incurred during the first ten (10) years of operation;\n\nii. Check if the period/taxable year when loss is claimed is within five (5) taxable years following the loss; and TIEHSA\n\niii. Ensure that there is no substantial change in the ownership of the business or enterprise.\n\n9. Depreciation\n\na. Compare total depreciation as shown by the depreciation schedule with the deduction claimed on the return. Reconcile any differences. Be alert for duplication of claimed deductions.\n\nb. Review the rates of depreciation used to determine if they are reasonable.\n\nc. Test check a representative number of items listed on the depreciation schedule to determine if the accumulated depreciation at the end of the accounting period exceeds the depreciable basis of the asset.\n\nd. Test check extensions and footings to determine if current depreciation has been correctly computed.\n\ne. Determine if there is any personal use of cars and other depreciable assets.\n\nf. Ascertain if proper cost allocation has been made on bulk purchases of depreciable and non-depreciable assets.\n\ng. Observe and determine if the taxpayer's depreciation policy and computation conforms with the guidelines in Revenue Memorandum Circular (RMC) No. 70-2010 \u2014 Circularizes the Revocation of BIR Ruling Nos. DA-413-04 and DA-436-04 and Clarifies the Basis in Computing Depreciation of Property, Plant and Equipment.\n\n12. [n]Depletion\n\na. Determine if the taxpayer has an economic interest in the property.\n\nb. Determine if the taxpayer has acquired, at least by investment, any control in oil, gas or mineral in a place, and secures, by any form of legal relationship, any income derived from the extraction of oil, gas or mineral.\n\nc. The following additional guidelines should be followed in the verification of the deduction for depletion:\n\nc.1 Ascertain that the sales reported in relation to a property do not include sales applicable to another property, sales of purchased minerals, non-minerals sales or other income items. TDAcCa\n\nc.2 Ascertain, where applicable, if mineral sales have been adjusted to \"gross income from the property\" by reduction of such factors as unallowable treatment cost, unallowable transportation costs, rents, royalties, including a proportionate part of lease bonuses, amounts paid to others in contract mining or similar operations where the other party has acquired an economic interest and is entitled to depletion, certain excise taxes, trade discounts allowed and other deductions.\n\nc.3 In situations where the basis for percentage of depletion is not the actual sales price of a finished product but a value of the mineral at the point at which has passed through the last allowable treatment process applicable thereto, determine if the value used is correct representative market or field price.\n\nc.4 Ascertain that mineral sales made to a business controlled by the taxpayer are not inflated to gain a tax advantage through depletion.\n\nc.5 Ascertain that all expenses applicable to a property have been charged including a proper allocation of general, administrative and overhead expenses. SDHacT\n\nc.6 Be alert on possible reduction of expenses by improper offsets such as income from scrap sales, cash discounts earned, sales of assets, and other income.\n\n13. Contributions\n\na. Determine if the done or recipient is the government or an accredited relief organization.\n\nb. Determine if the contribution is to be utilized for the rehabilitation of calamity stricken areas declared by the President.\n\nc. Verify if the claim is actually paid within the taxable year. Ascertain if the contribution can be deducted in full. If not, the amount should be within the threshold prescribed under existing regulations.\n\n14. Transportation and Travel, Representation and Entertainment\n\na. Determine if the expenditures have been incurred in relation to the business or practice of profession, not for personal use.\n\nb. For transportation and travel expenses, the following information are necessary to properly determine deductibility:\n\nb.1 Date of Travel\n\nb.2 Purpose of the travel and written authority for the travel\n\nb.3 The person or persons who incurred the expenditure\n\nb.4 Place or places travelled\n\nb.5 Amount of expenditure\n\nb.6 Means of transportation or travel\n\nc. Determine if taxpayer's travel and transportation and representation and entertainment expenses are recorded in a daily diary. If such expenses appear to be disproportionate to the taxpayer's income and business activities, the taxpayer should be required to support the book entries by furnishing documentary proofs and to establish the relevance of the expenses to the taxpayer's business.\n\nd. Determine the policy with respect to reimbursement or giving grants of allowances to employees.\n\ne. Ascertain the specific amounts recorded for these items.\n\nf. Prepare a summary of the total expenses posted to the accounts and compare the same with the deductions claimed per tax return.\n\ng. Select a representative test period or periods and test check entries in the ledger against supporting receipts and documents.\n\nh. Determine from the analysis and verification of supporting documents the reliability of the records.\n\ni. Determine company-owned vehicles and the expenses incurred in connection with these vehicles. ACETID\n\nj. Determine if entertainment facilities are used by the taxpayer primarily for the entertainment, amusement, or recreation of guests or employees. Facilities must be owned or form part of the taxpayer's trade, business or profession, or rented by such taxpayer, for which the taxpayer claims a depreciation or rental expense.\n\nk. Determine if representation expenses incurred by the taxpayer are not fixed representation allowances that are subject to withholding tax on wages pursuant to appropriate revenue regulations.\n\nl. For purposes of proving representation expense, the following information are necessary to properly determine deductibility:\n\nl.1 Amount of expense;\n\nl.2 Date and place of expense;\n\nl.3 Purpose of expense;\n\nl.4 Professional or business relationship of expense; and\n\nl.5 Name of person and company entertained with contact details.\n\nm. Look-out for possible double claim of expense, where supporting documents were used to support \"transportation and travel\" expense, as well as fringe benefit provided to managerial employees.\n\nn. Ascertain that representation and entertainment expenses are within the limitations allowed under existing regulations.\n\n15. Stationery and Office Supplies\n\na. Determine if the expenses claimed are not capitalizable office assets. TaDSCA\n\nb. Verify if personal purchases by the taxpayer/owner are included in the account.\n\nc. Determine the reasonableness of the expenditures.\n\nd. Compare receipts with the amounts claimed and investigate significant discrepancies.\n\n16. Professional Fees\n\na. Determine if the charges include amounts incurred for legal, accounting, engineering, appraisal, surveying and other similar services.\n\nb. Verify if the amounts are material and examine contracts to check the detailed description of the exact professional services rendered.\n\nc. Ascertain if the expenses do not constitute political contributions, bribes or kickbacks, which should be disallowed.\n\nd. Determine charges for research and experimental expenses which are lodged in professional fees. These items should form part of the cost of patents, trademarks and copyrights and other intangible assets subject to amortization.\n\ne. Verify if the corresponding taxes on the gross professional fees paid were withheld and remitted to the BIR. Otherwise, the expense should be disallowed.\n\n17. Insurance Expenses\n\na. Verify insurance policies. Premiums paid by employers on individual life insurance policies of their employees are not deductible if the employer is a direct or indirect beneficiary of such proceeds.\n\nb. Determine if the employee is the beneficiary of the insurance. Otherwise, the premiums paid shall be treated as an additional salary provided that it is reasonable.\n\nc. Check the account if it includes fire insurance, burglary insurance and other policies on officer's/stockholder's personal and real properties, which should be disallowed.\n\n18. Light, Power, Telephone and Telecommunication Expenses\n\na. Determine material amounts claimed as they may include capitalizable electrical equipment or purchases of capital items from utility companies.\n\nb. Examine the receipts issued by the utility companies. Compare the same with the amounts claimed per return. Investigate material discrepancies.\n\nc. Determine if there are personal expenses included in the expense account.\n\nd. Relate the expense consumption against sales and production to determine any possible under-declaration of sales.\n\n19. Miscellaneous expenses\n\na. Check the validity of the individual charges to the account.\n\nb. Determine if deductions claimed are adequately substantiated.\n\nc. Ascertain if the miscellaneous expenses claimed do not contain any personal items. EADSIa\n\nd. Scrutinize and vouch the supporting documents for material charges to this account since this is the spillover account of expenses.\n\nXI. AUDIT PROCEDURES ON WITHHOLDING TAXES\n\nThe following audit procedures outline the steps to be performed by an RO in the determination of the correct amount of withholding taxes due from withholding agents by ascertaining the following:\n\n1. The classification of the income payment and if the said income payments were subjected to withholding taxes.\n\n2. The rate of tax and the amount of tax withheld is correct; and\n\n3. The tax withheld is remitted within the prescribed dates mandated by regulations.\n\n4. Compliance with the submission of necessary annual information returns on withholding taxes and issuance of corresponding certificates of tax withheld to payees.\n\nThe audit procedures are classified according to the classification of withholding taxes, to wit:\n\n1. Withholding Tax on Compensation\n\n2. Expanded Withholding Tax\n\n3. Final Withholding Tax\n\n4. Withholding Tax on Government Money Payments\n\nAudit procedures for the different kinds of withholding taxes:\n\nA. Withholding Tax on Compensation\n\n1. Verify the number and list of employees per payroll records and the list of employees submitted to the Social Security System and the Department of Labor and Employment as against the alpha list of employees from whom taxes have been withheld which is attached to the annual information return (BIR Form 1604CF). SETAcC\n\n2. Examine payroll records, including confidential payroll, if any, employment contracts, supporting vouchers, receipts for advances/reimbursements of transportation and representation expenses, receipts for payment of compensation and reconcile amount of supported expenses with the figures per financial statements and withholding tax remittance returns.\n\n3. Check the computation of the correct withholding tax per payroll period. Take note to segregate the taxable compensation income into regular and supplementary.\n\n4. Examine monthly withholding tax remittance returns (BIR Form 1601C) and compare amounts remitted against the computed withholding tax on compensation per audit.\n\n5. Reconcile the aggregate gross compensation income stated in the withholding certificate (BIR Form 2316) with the total amount indicated in the gross compensation income column of the alpha list.\n\n6. Examine the salary expenses account and match it with basis of the withholding tax remitted per BIR Form No. 1604CF. Those expenses lodged in the salary expense without withholding shall not be deducted as expense.\n\nB. Expanded Withholding Tax (EWT)\n\n1. Verify if the taxpayer is classified as \"Top Withholding Agent\" to determine which income payments are subject to EWT.\n\n2. Check amount payable or paid per income statement and income tax returns against those declared in the monthly and annual returns.\n\n3. Ascertain validity of payments by and to prime contractors, and subcontractors, professionals, brokers, sub-brokers, agents of entertainers, etc. by examining contracts, subcontracts, vouchers, receipts and billings.\n\n4. Ascertain whether the correct percentage of tax is withheld for the income payments in accordance with existing regulations.\n\n5. Determine the correctness of the amounts subject to withholding tax by comparing the total payments per supporting documents against the amount per withholding tax returns.\n\n6. Verify the correctness of the payee classification and withholding tax rate applied.\n\n7. Determine the dates of payment or the period when the obligation to pay the amount subject to the withholding tax is due. The time to withhold is fixed at the time the obligation is due irrespective of the actual payment.\n\n8. Apply non-deductibility of related expense for those payments which were inadvertently not subjected to expanded withholding tax, unless the basic withholding tax plus penalties are remitted.\n\n9. If necessary, gather third party information and documents for verification.\n\n10. Reconcile the expenses accounts in comparison to those declared in the BIR Form No. 1604E.\n\nC. Final Withholding Taxes\n\n1. Review the contracts for payment of certain items of income to resident and non-resident payees of interest and rent, Central Bank approval papers, employment contracts, contract for payment of royalties, records of prizes or winnings and financial statements. ITCcAD\n\n2. Ascertain if the income payment was subjected to withholding tax in the year it was accrued, irrespective of whether the taxes withheld were remitted within ten (10) days following the month in which the payment was accrued. In the case of withholding tax on interest on bank deposits, the remittance shall be made quarterly within twenty (20) days after the end of each quarter.\n\n3. Check the correctness of the basis and rate of withholding tax applied. If a preferential tax rate is being availed of, verify the correctness of the rate used from the ruling issued by the Bureau.\n\n4. Ascertain the date of accrual of the income payment, to fix the time to withhold, irrespective of the actual remittance or non-remittance of the tax withheld by reason of official restriction.\n\n5. Verify correctness of remittance against monthly remittance returns and annual information return.\n\nD. Withholding Tax on Government Money Payments\n\n1. Examine government contracts with suppliers, purchase records, payment orders, billing records, receipts, vouchers, cash book and reports of Commission on Audit (COA) auditors.\n\n2. Check money payments from vouchers, billing records, records of purchases, COA audit reports, etc. against monthly remittance returns (BIR Form 1600), books of accounts and other accounting records maintained.\n\n3. Determine the correctness of bases and rates of tax applied.\n\n4. Check whether the correct amount of tax has been withheld and remitted within the prescribed period. Otherwise, impose appropriate penalties for non-withholding or non-remittance of the tax, as the case may be.\n\nXII. AUDIT OF MINIMUM CORPORATE INCOME TAX AND IMPROPERLY ACCUMULATED EARNINGS TAX\n\nA. Minimum Corporate Income Tax\n\nPursuant to Section 27 (E) (1) of the Tax Code, a minimum corporate income tax (MCIT) of two percent (2%) of the gross income as of the end of the taxable year is imposed on a corporation taxable under Title II of the Tax Code, beginning on the fourth taxable year immediately following the year in which such corporation commenced its business operations, when the minimum income tax is greater than the tax computed under Section 27 (A) of the Tax Code, as amended. Any excess of the MCIT over the normal income tax shall be carried forward and credited against the normal income tax for the three (3) immediately succeeding years.\n\nThe verification of the MCIT may be conducted as follows:\n\n1. Determine the taxability of the taxpayer to the MCIT. The MCIT shall apply to domestic and resident foreign corporations subject to the normal corporate income tax and shall not be imposed upon any of the following:\n\na. Domestic corporations operating as proprietary educational institutions;\n\nb. Domestic corporations engaged in non-profit hospital operations;\n\nc. Domestic corporations engaged in business as depository banks under the expanded foreign currency deposit system, otherwise known as Foreign Currency Deposit Units (FCDUs), on their income from foreign currency transactions with local commercial banks, including branches of foreign banks, authorized by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) to transact business with foreign currency deposit system units and other depository banks under the foreign currency deposit system, including their interest income from foreign currency loans granted to residents of the Philippines under the expanded foreign currency deposit system; aHECST\n\nd. Resident foreign corporations engaged in business as international carrier;\n\ne. Resident foreign corporations engaged in business as Offshore Banking Units (OBUs) on their income from foreign currency transactions with local commercial banks, including branches of foreign banks, authorized by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas to transact business with Offshore Banking Units, including interest income from foreign currency loans granted to residents of the Philippines;\n\nf. Resident Foreign corporations engaged in business as regional operating headquarters; and\n\ng. Firms that are taxed under a special income tax regime such as those in accordance with Republic Act (RA) Nos. 7916 and 7227.\n\n2. Determine the gross income subject to MCIT\n\na. Check the accuracy of the declaration of gross sales/receipts contributing to income taxable under Section 27 (A) of the Code.\n\na.1 Ascertain the accounting method employed by the taxpayer and verify consistency in its application. In case of sales of services by taxpayers employing the accrual basis of accounting, the term \"gross receipts\" shall mean amounts earned as gross income and these shall include amounts actually or constructively received during the taxable year.\n\na.2 Exclude items of sale specifically exempt from income tax and those passive incomes subject to special income tax rates.\n\na.3 Ascertain legitimacy of deductions from gross sales such as sales returns, discounts and allowances.\n\nb. Verify correctness of the claim for cost of goods sold. Ensure that only business expenses directly incurred to produce the merchandise to bring them to their present location and use or to provide the contracted services are included in this account.\n\nb.1 For trading or merchandising concern, \"cost of goods sold\" means the invoice cost of the goods sold, plus import duties, freight in transporting the goods to the place where the goods are actually sold, including insurance while the goods are in transit.\n\nb.2 For manufacturing concern, \"cost of goods manufactured and sold\" means all costs of production of finished goods, such as raw materials used, direct labor and manufacturing overhead, freight cost, insurance premiums and other costs incurred to bring the raw materials to the factory or warehouse.\n\nb.3 For sales of services, \"cost of services\" means all direct costs and expenses necessarily incurred to provide the services required by the customers and client including (1) salaries and employee benefits of personnel, consultants and specialists directly rendering the service; and (2) cost of facilities directly utilized in providing the service such as depreciation or rental of equipment used and cost of supplies.\n\nExcept for banks and other financial institutions, cost of sales/services shall not include interest expense. EHACcT\n\n3. Determine the period when the taxpayer becomes subject to the MCIT.\n\na. Verify from the BIR's Information System the year of taxpayer's registration with the BIR to ascertain whether or not it is subject to MCIT:\n\na.1 Firms registered with BIR in 1994 and earlier years are covered by MCIT beginning January 1, 1998.\n\na.2 Firms registered with BIR in any month in 1998 are covered three calendar years thereafter.\n\nFor fiscal period taxpayer, taxable year 1998 shall mean any fiscal period ending any day from July 1, 1997 up to June 30, 1998.\n\nb. Ascertain whether the first taxable period under the MCIT of the taxpayer using fiscal year accounting covers month/s in 1997 prior to the imposition of MCIT. Be sure that the computed MCIT due for 1998 using the apportionment formula is correct.\n\n4. Verify if the taxpayer is entitled to the relief from the imposition of the MCIT and secure documentary proof for the suspension of its imposition as approved by the Secretary of Finance.\n\n5. Check accuracy of the amount of excess MCIT carried over and credited against the normal tax within three (3) years immediately succeeding years from payment thereof, if any. See to it that any excess MCIT are not claimed against MCIT itself or against any other losses.\n\nB. Improperly Accumulated Earnings Tax\n\nIn accordance with the Section 29 (A) of the Tax Code, as amended, an Improperly Accumulated Earnings Tax (IAET) equal to ten percent (10%) of the improperly accumulated taxable income is imposed for each taxable year of each corporation identified under Section 27 (B) of the Tax Code.\n\nThe IAET shall be determined as follows:\n\n1. Ascertain the classification of the corporation and the business it is engaged in, to determine whether the imposition of the IAET shall apply. For this purpose, the fact that the corporation is a mere holding company or investment company is considered prima facie evidence of a purpose to avoid the tax upon its shareholders or members; hence, the 10% tax will automatically apply. However, the following corporations are not subject to the IAET:\n\na. Publicly held corporations;\n\nb. Banks and other non-bank financial intermediaries; and\n\nc. Insurance companies.\n\n2. Determine the reasonableness of the accumulation of profits or earnings and if the same is required for the purposes of the business, considering all the circumstances of the case.\n\na. Look into the following factors to ascertain if the accumulated profits are reasonably needed in the business:\n\na.1 Nature of the company's business;\n\na.2 Financial condition of the corporation at the close of the taxable year;\n\na.3 The dividend distribution history of the corporation;\n\na.4 The stock of the corporation is widely held in small blocks;\n\na.5 The use of the undistributed profits or earnings;\n\na.6 Retention of cash, securities and other assets unrelated to the business operations;\n\na.7 Advances or loss to stockholders, whether or not interest shall be paid; EacHCD\n\na.8 Dealings between the corporation and its stockholders, such as withdrawals by the shareholders as personal loans or the expenditure of funds by the corporation for the personal benefit of the shareholders;\n\na.9 The investment by the corporation of undistributed earnings in assets having no reasonable connection with the business;\n\na.10 The need for business expansion;\n\na.11 The earnings and expansion history of the taxpayer;\n\na.12 Past savings effected by non-distribution of profits to stockholders;\n\na.13 Past tax avoidance history of the corporation;\n\na.14 Portion of shareholder's assets transferred to the corporation;\n\na.15 Sudden shift in corporate or dividend policy of the company;\n\na.16 The percentage of income distributed to shareholders during the taxable year; and\n\na.17 Retirement of stocks, this being a capital transaction and should result in reduction of capital instead of reduction of earnings and profits.\n\nb. Secure copies of the board resolutions and verify therefrom any existence of undue accumulation of profits, correlating the findings with the plans per resolution as against the business activities and dealings made by the corporation.\n\nc. Require the taxpayer to submit documentary proof negating the clear preponderance of evidence that the profits were permitted to accumulate beyond the reasonable needs of the company's business. The accumulation of surplus for the reasonable needs of the business is not prevented if the purpose is not to prevent the imposition of the tax upon the shareholders. Undistributed income may be considered as properly accumulated in the following cases:\n\nc.1 The profit is retained for working capital needed by the business;\n\nc.2 The profit is invested in addition to plants, facilities and activities reasonably required by the business provided that the plans for expansion or improvement must be definite, concrete and capable of fulfillment and not what may be characterized as nebulous plans for future action.\n\nc.3 The accumulation of earnings is in accordance with contract obligations placed to the credit of a sinking fund for the purpose of retiring bonds.\n\nc.4 The profit is intended as reserves to meet competition, for anticipated losses or reverses in business and to meet business hazards and emergencies.\n\nd. Verify whether the company's increase in capitalization, if any, is necessary in the light of the existing circumstances surrounding the business. Ascertain whether declaration of stock dividends is from increased corporate capital since stock dividends are not taxable unless there is a change in interest, or unless they are disposed of by the holders. cIECaS\n\n3. Determine the amount of improperly accumulated taxable income subject to tax and penalties as follows:\n\na. Account for all the company's income during the year.\n\nb. Determine all the appropriate adjustments to the improperly accumulated taxable income. For purposes of imposing the tax, the taxable income shall be adjusted by the following items:\n\nb.1 Income exempt from tax;\n\nb.2 Income excluded from gross income;\n\nb.3 Income subject to final tax; and\n\nb.4 Amount of net operating loss carry-over deducted.\n\nc. Deduct dividends actually or constructively paid and income tax paid for the taxable year from the adjusted taxable income.\n\nd. Exclude the improperly accumulated income.\n\ne. Compute the 10% surtax based on the adjusted improperly accumulated taxable income. The computation of the surtax shall be made on a year-to-year basis depending on the thorough evaluation of the circumstances proving that the company has indeed permitted itself to accumulate earnings or profits beyond the reasonable needs of the business.\n\nXIII. INDIRECT APPROACH TO INVESTIGATION\n\nReconstruction of income is generally employed where the taxpayer keeps no record or inadequate records, or where there is strong suspicion that the taxpayer has received income from undisclosed sources.\n\nOver the years, the Bureau has developed the following general methods for reconstructing a taxpayer's income.\n\n\u2714 Benchmarking\n\n\u2714 Percentage method\n\n\u2714 Net worth method\n\n\u2714 Bank deposits method\n\n\u2714 Cash expenditure method\n\n\u2714 Unit and value method\n\n\u2714 Third party information or access to records method\n\nA. Benchmarking\n\nBenchmark is a point of reference for measurement or a set of standard to be used to measure the performance/compliance of taxpayers in a particular industry.\n\nBenchmarking of taxpayers refers to the process of setting a standard to determine the performance level of taxpayers in a given line of industry or sector. In this case, the ratios of Net VAT Due and Income Tax Due in relation to gross sales/receipt, vis-\u00e0-vis profit margin rate is to be used for the purpose of setting the industry standard for taxpayers' compliance.\n\nIn this connection, performance benchmarking of taxpayers by line of industry where the best performers, among taxpayers within the same line of industry or business, will be identified using profit margin rate, Net VAT Due and Income Tax Due in relation to gross sales/receipts, could be an excellent tool in increasing taxpayers' voluntary compliance. SAHITC\n\nMonitoring and evaluation of tax payments through the use of performance benchmarking will determine/identify taxpayers within industry groups who are paying below the minimum amount or set benchmarks for tax compliance purposes.\n\nB. Percentage Method\n\nThis method is the equivalent of a ratio analysis of percentages considered typical of the business under investigation to indicate potential areas of revenue adjustment in examination where revenue records do not exist. The computed amount of revenues based on the percentage computation is compared to the amount of revenues reflected on the return. The percentages used may be obtained from the taxpayer, industry publication, prior year's audit results, or third parties. The comparison will provide an indication on the possibility of revenue being understated. The extent of investigation required should be based on the degree of variance.\n\nIt must, however, be emphasized that in comparing transactions of similarly situated business, the name of the particular taxpayer used as the model must not be divulged to the taxpayer under investigation or in the report as this would constitute a violation by an internal RO of the provisions of Section 270, National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) on unlawful divulgence of trade secrets.\n\nSignificant ratios and trends to be analyzed are as follows:\n\n1. Percentage Mark-up\n\nThis is effective on businesses whose purchases can be readily broken down in groups with approximately the same percentage of mark-up.\n\nThe purchases should be grouped in items with the same percentage of mark-up. The appropriate percentage of mark-up would then be applied to each group of items to arrive at the gross receipts.\n\nThe percentage of mark-up can be determined from selling prices obtained from the taxpayer. However, if cooperation from the taxpayer is lacking, the information should be obtained from competitive business establishments in the same industry.\n\nOnce the gross receipts are determined, the taxpayer should be given the opportunity to explain the discrepancy noted between the reconstructed gross receipts and the amounts reflected in the books and in the tax returns. The taxpayer may argue that the percentage mark-up should not be applied to purchases which were stolen, broken or spoiled. cDCSET\n\nWhen reconstructing income using the mark-up method, possible unrecorded purchases should be considered.\n\n2. Gross Profit Ratio or Gross Margin Percentage\n\nThe gross profit is expressed as a percentage of sales.\n\nGross Profit Ratio\n\n=\n\n(Net Sales \u2013 Cost of Goods Sold)\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\nNet Sales\n\nNote: Net Sales should comprise of Zero-rated, Exempt and Vatable sales, net of sales discounts, returns and allowances.\n\nAnalysis of said ratios to evaluate the taxpayer's performance during current in previous years should be done, or with other firms in the same industry to determine the normal gross profit ratio within the same industry.\n\n3. Profit Margin\n\nProfit Margin\n\n=\n\nNet Income\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\nNet Sales\n\nIf the profit margin is low, this will indicate that the firm's sales prices are relatively low or that its costs are relatively high or both.\n\n4. Total Assets Turnover\n\nTotal Assets Turnover\n\n=\n\nSales\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\nTotal Assets\n\nA high rate compared to the industry would signify sufficient volume of business and if a net loss is declared, questions must be raised or further investigation and analysis should be performed. Take note on the date the assets were increased, for they may not have been put into use due to limited time.\n\n5. Inventory Turnover\n\nThe inventory turnover is computed as follows:\n\nInventory Turnover\n\n=\n\nSales\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\nAverage Inventory\n\nor\n\nCost of Sales\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\n(Beginning Inventory + Ending Inventory)/2\n\nIf the turnover is low, the company could be holding damaged or obsolete materials not actually worth their stated volume.\n\nAverage inventory at a given point x turnover rate = total estimated purchases during the year.\n\nC. Net Worth Method\n\nThe fact that the taxpayer's books and records accurately reflect the figures on the income and business tax returns does not prevent the use of the net worth method of proof. The RO can still look beyond the taxpayer's books and records and use any evidences available to contravene their accuracy. However, this net worth method is most often used when one or more of the following conditions prevail:\n\n1. The taxpayer maintains no books and records.\n\n2. The taxpayer's books and records are not available.\n\n3. The taxpayer's books and records are inadequate.\n\n4. The taxpayer withholds books and records from investigation/verification by authorized RO(s).\n\n5. The taxpayer maintains books and records; however, based on the assets known to be purchased by the taxpayer within the taxable year, it is conclusive that there is undeclared income. IAcDET\n\nThis is a method of reconstructing income which is based on the theory that if the taxpayer's net worth has increased in a given year in an amount larger than his reported income, he had understated his income for that year.\n\nIn applying this method, it is important to establish the net worth on a fixed starting date. This is to erase doubts that the increase in net worth or the excess of expenditures over reported income did not originate from prior accumulated funds (i.e., hoarded cash or undisclosed assets which do not represent income during the tax year.)\n\nIn preparing a net worth statement or summary for use in a criminal investigation, the ROs should ensure that:\n\n1. The taxpayer's method of accounting is used.\n\n2. The cost of assets and actual amount of liabilities are used and that values other than cost, are not considered in the net worth computation.\n\n3. Estimated non-deductible expenditures are eliminated from the computation.\n\n4. Generally accepted accounting principles in conformity with the Tax Code, as amended, and regulations are followed.\n\nNet worth computation\n\nAssets\n\nxxx\n\nLess: Liabilities and Accumulated depreciation\n\nxxx\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\n\nNet Worth\n\nxxx\n\nLess: Prior Year's Net Worth\n\nxxx\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\n\nIncrease (Decrease) in Net Worth\n\nxxx\n\nAdd: Non-deductible items\n\nPersonal, living and family Expenses\n\nxxx\n\nIncome tax payments\n\nxxx\n\nInsurance premiums\n\nxxx\n\nGifts\n\nxxx\n\nNon-deductible contributions\n\nxxx\n\nNet capital loss\n\nxxx\n\nAmnesty tax payments\n\nxxx\n\nEstate and donor's taxes\n\nxxx\n\nOther non-deductible items\n\nxxx\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\n\nTotal Non-deductible items\n\nxxx\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\n\nNet Income before further adjustments\n\nxxx\n\nLess: Non-taxable items\n\nGifts, donations and inheritance Received\n\nxxx\n\nNon-taxable stock dividends\n(if reflected in assets)\n\nxxx\n\nRetirement pay from SSS\n\nxxx\n\nNon-recognized gains from exchange of property under Sec. 40 of the Tax Code\n\nxxx\n\nSocial Security benefits received from foreign government and institutions (PD220)\n\nxxx\n\nOther non-taxable items\n\nxxx\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\n\nTotal Non-taxable items\n\nxxx\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\n\nNET INCOME SUBJECT TO TAX\n\nxxx\n\n=====\n\nBurden of Proof\n\nThe \"Net Worth\" method to be acceptable must establish with reasonable certainty an opening net worth, to serve as a starting point from which to compute future increases in the taxpayer's assets. It must also introduce evidence to support the inference that the taxpayer's net increases are attributable to currently taxable income.\n\nIn computing the increase, the taxpayer's assets are totaled and net worth as determined at the close of the previous taxable year is subtracted from the total at the close of the taxable year in question. The remainder, if any, is the increase for the taxable year, and constitutes taxable income if no adjustments are required.\n\nHowever, where net worth increase is the income determinant the RO may, in making the final computation upon which to base the tax, add to the increase estimated living expenses incurred by the taxpayer since such expenditures are presumed to have come from income. The taxpayer, on the other hand, is entitled to reduce the reconstructed income by the amount of depreciation allowable on assets which are not considered in determining net worth.\n\nThe factors to be considered in reconstructing net worth are variable, like availability of evidence. Generally, net worth has been computed on the basis of some, all or combination of the following:\n\na. bank records;\n\nb. securities;\n\nc. financial statements;\n\nd. fixed assets;\n\ne. inventory; and\n\nf. all available records.\n\nD. Bank Deposit Method\n\nWhen the taxpayer's records are apparently inaccurate or manifestly incomplete, the RO may look at the bank deposits of the taxpayer as evidence income. Under the bank deposit method, the bank records of the taxpayer are analyzed and the RO estimates income on the basis of total bank deposits after eliminating non-income items. This method stands on the premise that deposits represent taxable income unless otherwise explained as being non-taxable items. This method can be used if the RO has been allowed access to the taxpayer's bank records or if the RO has obtained documented evidence from reliable sources as to the taxpayer's bank accounts.\n\nWhile the mere deposit of money does not prove the receipt of taxable income as alleged by the RO, the burden is on the taxpayer to prove that various deposits did not stem from the receipt of taxable income. The passage of time makes it difficult for the taxpayer to meet this burden but this does not relieve him from showing the non-taxable source to contradict the RO's determination. If the bank deposit method is used in support of findings of fraud, however, the burden of proof is on the RO. TSHEIc\n\nWhen computing taxable income under this method, it is appropriate to add to the amount of the bank deposit the amount of cash expenditures from undeposited funds for personal expenses which is non-deductible for tax purposes. Withdrawals which can be identified as deductible are allowed against the taxable income determined.\n\nIn using this method, it is proper to prove the existence of a business and the practice of making deposit of business income into one or more bank accounts and then to adjust the total deposits for transfers, redeposits, deposits otherwise explained and finally to allow for ascertainable expenses, deductions and exemptions.\n\n1. Analysis of Bank Deposits\n\nThe RO's careful analysis of the taxpayer's bank deposits constitutes the most important phase of his investigation. A review of the taxpayer's personal and business bank records for several months should be made. The following questions should be answered in analyzing the taxpayer's deposits:\n\na. Are deposits made on a basis consistent with the information secured during the initial interview?\n\nb. Are there any large or unusual deposits?\n\nc. Are there any deposits from sources not reflected on the tax return?\n\nd. Did the examination of the taxpayer's cancelled checks reveal additional bank accounts not previously disclosed by the taxpayer?\n\ne. Are there checks endorsed by the taxpayer and deposited into an account not previously disclosed?\n\nf. Are there checks for assets or personal expenses that affect the taxpayer's standard of living?\n\n2.

Deposits may also be shown to represent amounts on hand at the start of the year in which they are deposited rather than income in that year.\n\nThe bank deposit method, like the net worth method, encompasses an area of uncertainty. Though the taxpayer's records are inadequate for precise and complete verification of its return, a determination of income by the bank deposit method will be rejected if it is inconsistent with surrounding circumstances and gives an absurd result. aSIHcT\n\nE. Cash Expenditure Method\n\nAn outgrowth of the net worth method of determining income is the \"excess cash expenditure method.\" This method assumes that the excess of a taxpayer's expenditures during a tax period over his reported income for that period is taxable to the extent not approved otherwise. The taxpayer may show that this excess resulted from non-taxable items such as loans, gifts, inheritance or assets on hand at the beginning of the period.\n\nWhile it has been said that no opening worth is needed when the cash expenditure method is used, the more impressive authority is to the contrary. The two steps involved in the cash expenditure method are: a) valuation of the taxpayer's assets at the beginning of the taxable period in order to determine the taxpayer's funds available for expenditure during the ensuing taxable periods and b) determination of the amount by which expenditures exceed reported income for the taxable period.\n\nTo show a failure to report the full amount of income by the use of this method, it must be demonstrated that the expenditures made during the taxable year were in excess of the available funds during the year which were reported on the tax return.\n\nTotal expenditures may not include checks drawn to cash and items for which the taxpayer has paid in cash, unless the cash bank withdrawals were not used to pay for the cash expenditure. The burden is on the taxpayer to establish the relationship between cash withdrawal and individual items. Expenditures may not necessarily come from income, but very large expenditures for personal purposes each year may be interpreted as an indication that the income being reported was too small.\n\nProof in cash expenditure case may be difficult, for it is highly unusual for anyone to keep accurate records of personal living expenses. However, once the RO has made a determination as to the amount of cash expenditures, the burden of proof to establish a different amount is on the taxpayer.\n\nProvided hereunder is the formula for the expenditures method, to wit:\n\nExpenditures (money spent or applied)\n\nxxx\n\nLess: Non-taxable Sources of funds\n\nxxx\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\n\nCorrected Adjusted Gross Income\n\nxxx\n\nLess: Reported Taxable Income\n\nxxx\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\n\nAdditional Taxable Income (Unreported Income)\n\nxxx\n\n====\n\nF. Unit and Value Method\n\nThis is not considered as a primary proof. The determination or verification of gross receipts may be computed by applying price and profit figures to the known ascertainable quality of business of the taxpayer. In addition, there are existing regulatory bodies to which the taxpayer reports units of production or service, some of which are:\n\n1. Records of sugar milled by a sugar central\n\n2. Records of fish production to the Bureau of Fishery and Aquatic Resources\n\n3. Records of production by pioneer and non-pioneer industries to the Board of Investments\n\nTable 1.

Third Party Information (TPI) Access to Records Method\n\nROs must utilize the pre-processed data provided by the Audit Information, Tax Exemptions and Incentives Division for TPI. Moreover, ROs should determine when to make other third party inquiries. The decision to make a third party inquiry is shaped by the size of the peso amount involved and the volume of the transaction. Third party inquiry through access to records can be time consuming. ROs must weigh the benefits to be realized from work against the time required to make an access to records and the availability of the needed information through other methods. CSEHcT\n\nXIV. DISCUSSION OF DISCREPANCY\n\nEssential to an effective audit of internal revenue tax liabilities is the holding of a closing conference with a discussion of discrepancy with the taxpayer before the preparation of the final report of investigation by the RO assigned to the tax case. During this time, the RO and his supervisor explain to the taxpayer how the assessment of his tax liability was arrived at and the taxpayer is given an opportunity to present his side of the case.\n\nThe discussion of discrepancy shall in no case extend beyond thirty (30) days from receipt of the Notice of Discrepancy. If it is found that the taxpayer is still liable for deficiency tax or taxes after presenting his side, and the taxpayer is not amenable, the head of the investigating office shall endorse the case with the report within seven (7) days from the discussion to the concerned reviewing and approving office for issuance of a deficiency tax assessment.\n\nXV. REPORT MAKING\n\nThe RO is required to make a report after the investigation/audit has been conducted. Before starting to write a report, the Revenue Officer (RO) should have in mind a definite outline as to arrangement in which the facts and evidence may be presented in the most effective manner. A good general plan is to state the problem, present the results of the investigation and set forth the conclusions and recommendations.\n\nThe report to be prepared by the RO in the conduct of his investigation shall contain the following:\n\nA. Narrative Report\n\nThis is a memorandum report prepared and submitted by the RO. The narrative report shall contain the following:\n\n1. A preliminary statement stating:\n\na. the basis of the authority to investigate, specially the Letter of Authority or Tax Verification Notice, date issued/served and details of referrals or revalidations, if any;\n\nb. type of investigation/verification undertaken; and\n\nc. profile of the taxpayer, particularly the type of business organization, nature of business, product line, other sources of income, information of its registration with the SEC, BOI, PEZA, etc., identification of major owners/stockholders and subsidiaries/affiliates, if relevant, brief description of accounting system/method used, description of any extraordinary business activity and kinds and amounts of incentives availed of, if any.\n\n2. A brief description of the approach in investigating stating, among others:\n\na. the books of accounts; records and documents verified;\n\nb. the audit procedures adopted;\n\nc. access to records undertaken;\n\nd. the authorized representative of the taxpayer; and\n\ne. the dates and results of conferences.\n\n3. Results of investigation summarizing:\n\na. the audit findings;\n\nb. utilization of third party information;\n\nc. discrepancies discovered, disallowances made and other relevant facts uncovered during the examination;\n\nd. basis of computation of recommended deficiency taxes/tax credit or refund, if any; and\n\n4. A recommendation for:\n\na. the review/approval of the report of investigation and issuance of termination letter after collection of the deficiency tax;\n\nb. assessment of deficiency taxes indicating the prescription of the case; or AcSCaI\n\nc. such other recommendations as may be necessary under the circumstances.\n\nB. Duly Accomplished Revenue Officer's Audit Report\n\nThese forms are required to be accomplished properly and accurately by the RO in reporting the results of investigation/verification.\n\n1. BIR Form 0500 \u2014 This form shall be accomplished by all RO in reporting results of investigation/verification of income tax liabilities of taxpayers.\n\n2.

BIR Form 0514 \u2014 This form is to be used in reporting results of investigation/verification on Excise Tax Credit/Refund.\n\nC. Working Papers\n\nWorking papers form the most important portion of a report as they provide all the information on the investigation conducted. They are the best evidence of the scope of the investigation and the diligence with which it was completed. They further constitute the basis for the RO's determination of deficiency, liability and corresponding penalties.\n\nThe working papers should include all notes made before, during, and after a tax investigation, which relates to his findings on a particular tax return and shall include items raised during the analysis of the return as possible issues. They should also include explanations on the various observations and analysis of pertinent schedules and information.\n\nWorking papers prepared by the RO are used as sources of a more detailed information, which he may use later on as witness in court in case of litigation. The concluded examination should therefore be reflected by adequate working papers. Memory should not be relied upon in recounting the facts determined in the investigation. There is no better way to present the fact that an item or issue has been extensively explored on except by significant notes in working papers. Each of the working papers should be numbered and labeled clearly showing the name of the taxpayer, year of examination, date prepared and the signature of the RO should appear on each page. The pages should be numbered and prepared in the RO's own handwriting. SCEHaD\n\nThe requirement is that the working papers should document whatever transpired during the examination. These may include summaries or transcripts of accounts analyzed, schedule of specific items checked, reconciliation of accounts, analysis of reserves and all other pertinent notes of the work performed.\n\nThe basic working papers consist of, but are not limited to the following:\n\n1. Working papers showing real and nominal accounts;\n\n2. Working papers showing discrepancies, disallowances, adjustments and computation of deficiency taxes;\n\n3. Reconciliation of net income per financial statements with the net income per income tax return;\n\n4. Schedule of income producing property, if applicable;\n\n5. Schedule of taxes and licenses;\n\n6. Schedule of depreciation;\n\n7. Schedule of loans/notes/accounts payable and interest expenses/advances from officers/stockholders, if applicable;\n\n8.

                                    "Details": "I. OBJECTIVE\n\nThe Transfer Pricing Audit Guidelines is intended to supplement Revenue Audit Memorandum Order (RAMO) No. 1-2000 (Updated Handbook on Audit Procedures and Techniques Volume 1) and RAMO No. 1-2008 (Computer Assisted Audit Tools and Techniques), and to provide standardized audit procedures and techniques in the conduct of audit of taxpayers with related party and/or intra-firm transactions in order to ensure quality audit.\n\nII. PURPOSE\n\nThe Transfer Pricing Audit Guidelines provides a framework and guide for transfer pricing examinations. Every transfer pricing issue is unique, and teams should exercise their judgement on how to best apply this guide.\n\nIII. SCOPE\n\n1. The Guidelines are applicable on controlled transactions including sale, purchase, transfer and utilization of tangible and intangible assets, provision of intra-group services, interest payments and capitalization among others, between related/associated parties, where at least one party is assessable or chargeable to tax in the Philippines.\n\n2. The Guidelines are also applicable by analogy, in relation to transactions between permanent establishment (PE) and its head office or other related branches. For the purpose of the Guidelines, the PE will be treated as a separate and distinct enterprise from its head office or other related branches/subsidiaries for tax purposes.\n\nIV. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS\n\nRevenue Officers are required to make a report after the audit has been conducted.\n\nIV. [n] REPEALING CLAUSE\n\nThis order supersedes all revenue issuances or portions thereof inconsistent herewith.\n\nV. EFFECTIVITY\n\nAll revenue officers and other employees concerned are hereby directed to use the aforesaid Manual in the audit/investigation of tax returns immediately after the approval of this Order.\n\n(SGD.)

MANALO\n\nSecretariat\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nIntroduction\n\nGlobalization spears up multinational corporations in expanding out their business activities globally. The fast pacing progress in technology, communication and transportation make it accessible for them to determine their business options through investment and sale/purchase transactions between countries. High production costs and saturation of domestic markets lead them to look into other countries where they could have advantages in production costs (location saving) and in market share (market premium).\n\nThe rapid growth of multinational corporation entails an increase of related transactions globally. This special relation may evoke the possibility that income or profit may be reported smaller than the actual one or costs/expenses may be claimed excessively. These related transactions include sale, purchase, transfer and utilization of tangible and intangible assets, provision of intra-group services, interest payments and capitalization among others. Some of the reasons that drive the group of companies in setting up the transfer prices for related party transactions include minimizing tax, repatriation of capital, exchange rate difference risk, and window dressing of the parent company's financial statements.\n\nThe transfer price in a related party transaction must conform with the arm's length principle (ALP) as mandated in Section 5 of Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 2-2013 (Transfer Pricing Guidelines). This principle stipulates that if the conditions in the transaction between related parties are the same as or similar to the conditions in transaction between the independent parties that are used as comparable, the price or profit in the related transactions must be the same as or similar to the range of prices or profit in the transactions between the comparable independent parties.\n\nThe Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR), as stipulated in Section 50 of the National Internal Revenue Code and as implemented under RR No. 2-2013 has the authority to review, allocate and distribute the income and deductions of the related party transaction (cross-border and domestic) including intra-firm transactions [1] between related parties to determine the appropriate revenue and taxable income by using the Comparable Uncontrolled Price Method (CUP), the Resale Price Method (RPM), the Cost Plus Method (CPM), the Profit Split Method (PSM), the Transactional Net Margin Method (TNMM) or other method.\n\nAudit on transfer pricing on related transactions is a test of application of ALP to the related transactions, hence, these audit guidelines.\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nAudit Procedure on Transfer Pricing\n\nAudit is a series of activities of collecting and processing data, information, and or proofs objectively and professionally based on an audit standard to test compliance in fulfillment of tax obligations and/or for other purposes in the context of implementing the provisions of the existing tax laws and regulations.\n\nA transfer pricing audit is conducted to test the compliance in fulfillment of tax obligations of a taxpayer with related party transactions. Audit procedure on transfer pricing consists of Preparation, Implementation and Reporting.\n\nIn the preparation of audit, Revenue Officer should collect and learn taxpayer's data in respect of special relations with their related/associated parties.\n\nImplementation of audit on transfer pricing comprises of the following: (1) Determination of the characteristics of the taxpayer's business; (2) Selection of the transfer pricing method; and (3) Application of the ALP.\n\nLastly, Reporting of Audit on transfer pricing is carried out in accordance with the audit procedure.\n\nA. PREPARATION FOR TRANSFER PRICING AUDIT\n\nThis phase of the examination process determines the scope of the audit. Proper selection of issues and application of a transfer pricing method for transfer pricing examinations should have the broadest impact on achieving compliance regardless of the size or type of entity. The audit plan will be issue-focused and contain the following: issues identified, audit steps, timeline(s), and communication agreements. The Revenue Officer should coordinate with the taxpayer to establish a plan to complete the transfer pricing audit in a timely manner. The audit can be productive if the Revenue Officer and the taxpayer work together in a spirit of cooperation, responsiveness, and transparency. The audit plan may be adjusted throughout the process.\n\nThe steps in the audit preparation include the following:\n\n1. Review the available information relating to the taxpayer's related party transactions and its related parties such as Annual Income Tax Return and its attachments (Audited Financial Statements), Tax Treaty Relief Applications/Rulings and prior years audit reports, if any. Further research may be done about the taxpayer's background, history and core business operations through websites, commercial databases, or other sources of data to confirm the existence of a special relationship with the transaction counterparty.\n\n2. Set a schedule for initial meeting with the taxpayer covering the general background of the taxpayer's business operations, key functions, product/service flow, worldwide structure, transfer pricing policy, transfer pricing (TP) documentation and other relevant information. The Revenue Officers may request for information/evidence of related party transactions together with other attachments. (Please see templates in Annexes 1-8.)\n\n3. Evaluate the information and documents submitted.\n\n4. Set for a transfer pricing orientation meeting with the taxpayer to discuss the initial findings including but not limited to:\n\na. Taxpayer's background and history of intercompany transactions.\n\nb. Discuss all intercompany transactions in the year(s) under examination.\n\n\u2022 Gain understanding of the taxpayer's rationale for entering into the transactions.\n\n\u2022 Gain understanding of the taxpayer's value chain(s) associated with the intangible services, and/or tangible goods.\n\n\u2022 Gain understanding whether the intercompany transaction is associated with the transfer of an income stream, or contribution to the value, of any intangible.\n\nc. Discuss the functions performed, assets employed, and risks assumed by each controlled party of the respective intercompany transaction.\n\nd. Understand how the preparer of the transfer pricing study gained knowledge of each controlled party's functions performed, assets employed and risks assumed and request supporting documents (interview notes, minutes).\n\ne. Discuss whether to request background documentation.\n\nf. Identify persons responsible for structuring the transaction from the tax planning perspective.\n\ng. Discuss the need to request additional documentation including contracts and agreements not previously requested.\n\nh. Gain an understanding of the transfer pricing methods selected by the taxpayer for significant transactions.\n\ni. Discuss the process for requesting follow-up meetings and clarifications.\n\n5. If needed, require the taxpayer's explanation through a Supplemental Letter Request for Information on Related Party Transactions (Annex 9) for clarification purposes.\n\n6. The Revenue Officers shall analyze the risk of arm's length price in the related party transactions based on the results of the prior meetings and as set forth in the Annexes. Factors that need to be examined include the following:\n\na. Worldwide effective tax rate and whether the taxpayer's overall tax position is such that income shifting would be beneficial from a financial accounting/cash flow standpoint;\n\nb. Potential applicability of a tax treaty;\n\nc. Source of income and tax credit availability;\n\nd. Materiality of related party transactions, which may be measured from their proportion to sales or to net operating profit;\n\ne. Taxpayer's transactions with related parties domiciled/located in countries or economic zones with low or zero tax rates;\n\nf. Related party transactions of a special nature, such as transfer of intangible assets (license), royalty payment, intra-group services, and interest expense;\n\ng. Performance of the taxpayer's net operating profit is lower than that of other companies in the same industry;\n\nh. Significance of related party transactions not included in the components of the taxpayer's net operating profit such as interest expense, gain/loss on sale of assets, and exchange rate gain/loss;\n\ni. Non-routine types of related party transactions, such as business restructuring that involves or does not involve intangible assets and sales of intangible property; and\n\nj. The taxpayer suffered losses over several years.\n\nWhen the risks of related party transaction are present, the Revenue Officers shall include in the audit plan the appropriate method in determining arm's length price. If none, the Revenue Officers shall perform the testing in the implementation of the audit. Upon discovery of the risks, the audit plan shall be revised accordingly.\n\n7. Set a schedule for re-assessment meeting with the taxpayer based on the following:\n\na. Determine which transaction(s) need(s) further development, which transactions may be closed or which transaction(s) need(s) to be eliminated from further analysis;\n\nb. Determine the level and scope of TP involvement going forward;\n\nc. Discuss any new information and reassess/adjust working hypothesis(es);\n\nd. Assess level and scope of counsel involvement and begin to consider any discrete legal issues;\n\ne. Continue to document, organize and outline transactions determined to warrant further development and analysis based on information gathered to date; and\n\nf. Begin to formulate the best method analysis to include assessment of the taxpayer's selected method.\n\n\u2022 If there is doubt as to whether the taxpayer's selected method is the best method, assess the reliability and comparability of the taxpayer's assumptions and data.\n\n\u2022 Determine additional accounting data and records needed for this assessment for application of any methods being considered as a best method.\n\nB. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE TRANSFER PRICING AUDIT\n\nThe implementation of the transfer pricing audit involves stages of issue development by determining the facts, applying the law to those facts, and understanding the various tax implications of the issue. The Revenue Officer and the taxpayer shall conduct interactive discussions and every effort should be made to resolve any factual differences. Communication and continuous reassessments should remain throughout the implementation process.\n\nImplementation of audit on transfer pricing consists of the following steps:\n\n1) Determination of the Characteristics of the Taxpayer's Business.\n\nEvery taxpayer has different characteristics; even within the same industry, each company has different strategy, organizational structure, and objectives. This stage is needed to understand the reality of the taxpayer's business. The Revenue Officers may gain an overview of the industry in which the taxpayer operates, the business of the group of companies, and the main functions of each member of the company group based on the taxpayer's internal and external sources of information.\n\nBy determining the characteristics of the taxpayer's business and understanding the functions of its related parties, the Revenue Officers will gain an impression of the return expected by each of the parties in the transaction, as well as the risk/s of tax avoidance using transfer pricing transactions.\n\nThe accurate determination of the characteristics of the related transactions and the taxpayer's business will ease the selection of reliable comparable.\n\nMeasures in the determination of the characteristics of the taxpayer's business, among other things, are (a) identifying the characteristics of the related transactions of the taxpayer and by (b) conducting functional analysis.\n\na) Identify the Characteristics of the Related Transactions of the Taxpayer.\n\nThe Revenue Officers shall do an industry analysis by using external sources of information, including industry research reports, publicly available annual financial statements of the main players in the taxpayer's industry, data from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Transfer Pricing Documentation, and other information media available through the internet or in databases in order to gain a general understanding of the conditions of the taxpayer's industry. Analysis of the taxpayer's industry shall be done with consideration to several factors, including main characteristics of taxpayer's business and performance of the industry.\n\nUnderstand the condition of the related transactions for comparability analysis. For purposes of identifying the related transactions, the following factors shall be considered:\n\na.1) Conditions that influence industry\n\na.1.1) industry and market segment where the taxpayer carries on business, i.e., growth of industry, technology, size and growth of market;\n\na.1.2) competitive condition of the taxpayer and its competitors; and\n\na.1.3) economic factors and existing regulations that influence the taxpayer's business.\n\na.2) Conditions of the related transactions\n\na.2.1) type and value of related transactions;\n\na.2.2) the period and frequency/rate of the related transactions;\n\na.2.3) terms of the agreement, including the set-off arrangement between the related parties;\n\na.2.4) terms of contract, including term of delivery, discount;\n\na.2.5) parties involved in the related transactions, as well as the relation between the parties, for example: parent-subsidiary relationship, joint venture, franchise, cost contribution arrangement; and\n\na.2.6) chain of transaction in which the taxpayer's affiliated transactions become part of.\n\na.3) Functional role of the taxpayer in the Group\n\na.3.1) structure of the taxpayer's organization in its group including the decision making process;\n\na.3.2) shareholding structure of the taxpayer in the group;\n\na.3.3) strategies, policies, as well as targets of the taxpayer;\n\na.3.4) function performed by each member of the group (supply chain management); and\n\na.3.5) restructuring of taxpayer's business.\n\na.4) Financial ratio\n\nIn audit on transfer pricing, it is important to do early examination on financial performance of the taxpayer to identify the risk for tax avoidance by reason of the special relation. Prior examination can be done by getting the average ratio of the taxpayer's industry.\n\nIn applying the ALP, financial ratio (degree of gross/net profits) of the taxpayer will be compared to that of the financial ratio (degree of gross/net profits) of comparable companies to determine the ALP of the taxpayer's business.\n\nThe following are the financial ratios that can be used as basis/indicator for comparable:\n\na.4.1) Gross Margin to Sale Ratio\n\n=\n\nGross profit\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\nSale\n\na.4.2) Gross Profit to Basic Sale Price Ratio\n\n(Gross Mark-up)\n\n=\n\nGross profit\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\nBasic Sale Price\n\na.4.3) Rate of Return of Sale Ratio\n\n=\n\nNet Operating Income\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\nSale\n\na.4.4) Rate of Return of Total Costs Ratio\n\n=\n\nNet Operating Income\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\nHPP [2] + Total Operating Costs\n\na.4.5) Rate of Return of Assets (ROA) Ratio\n\n=\n\nNet Operating Income\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\nTotal Operating Assets [3]\n\na.4.6) Rate of Outcome of Capital Employed (ROCE) Ratio\n\n=\n\nNet Operating Income\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\nCurrent Assets-Liabilities\n\na.4.7) Berry Ratio\n\n=\n\nGross profit\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\nOperating Costs\n\na.4.8) Debts to Capital Ratio\n\n=\n\nDebts\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\nCapital\n\na.4.9) Research and Development (R&D) Costs to Sale Ratio\n\n=\n\nR&D Costs\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\nSale\n\na.4.10) Marketing Costs to Sale Ratio\n\n=\n\nMarketing Costs\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\nSale\n\nb) Make Functional Analysis.\n\nFunctional analysis is performed to obtain accurate identification on the characteristics of the taxpayer's business as well of their counterparts. By knowing them, the level of the risks borne and remuneration (profit) which are proportional with the risks borne by any of the parties can be predicted. For example, the characteristics of business of the parties who perform manufacturing function among others, are fully fledged manufacturing, contract manufacturing, and toll manufacturing. On the other hand, characteristics of the parties who perform distributor function, among other things, are fully fledged distributor, limited risk distributor, commissionaire, and commission agent.\n\nFAR analysis is a mapping of the economically relevant facts and characteristics of related party transactions with attention to the Functions, Assets, and Risks (FAR) and the allocation of the functions, assets, and risks between the parties involved in the affiliated transactions to accurately know the characteristics of each party.\n\nThe Revenue Officers need to study several sources of information, including:\n\n1) Organizational chart of the taxpayer under audit and structural chart of the group;\n\n2) List of all employees, job descriptions, and the authorities of the employees involved in the economically relevant functions;\n\n3) Audit financial statements;\n\n4) Segmented financial statements (segmented both by function and by independence of transactions);\n\n5) Global pricing policy document;\n\n6) Licensing contracts for intangible assets to recognize the parties that own intangible assets and identify payments/receipt of royalty to/from related parties; and\n\n7) Transfer Pricing Documentation.\n\nThe Revenue Officers should focus on the following activities in performing FAR analysis:\n\n1) Identify the significant/material economically relevant functions performed by the taxpayer, including design, processing, assembly, research and development, sale and distribution, purchase, provision of services, marketing, promotion, transportation, financing and management and other related activities.\n\n2) Identify the significant functions performed based on the following:\n\n\u2022 Transfer Pricing Documentation and/or FAR analysis form;\n\n\u2022 Taxpayer's financial statements; and\n\n\u2022 Organizational Chart.\n\n3) Prepare questionnaire needed for interviews with key personnel that are involved in significant functions.\n\n4) Conduct a review and analysis of accounting data, interviews, plant tours and site visitations.\n\n\u2022 Work with the taxpayer to identify key personnel for interviews/site tours.\n\n\u2022 Work with taxpayer to identify plan and site for tour(s).\n\n\u2022 Work with core members to prepare for interviews and tours.\n\n\u2022 Consider and evaluate for foreign travel.\n\n5) The Revenue Officers need to prepare Minutes of Provision of Information in connection with information relevant to the FAR analysis (Annex 10).\n\n6) During the interview, confirm the functions/contributions/participations performed by related parties regarding the related transactions, including:\n\na) Transactions with related parties that function as intermediaries in product sale/purchase transactions, the Revenue Officers need to do research on the organizational chart, number and qualifications of personnel, and financial statements of the related parties, in order to confirm that these related parties have functions in the taxpayer's related party transactions.\n\nb) Transactions of transfer of intangible assets, the Revenue Officers need to confirm the qualifications (economic/legal ownership) of the party that receives the transfer of the intangible assets, i.e., considering the ability of the transferee in developing, protecting, or maintaining the intangible assets. This can be done by studying the organizational chart, number and qualifications of personnel, and financial statements of the related parties.\n\nc) Transactions of provision of intra-group services, the Revenue Officers need to confirm the qualifications (beneficial) of the party that delivers the intra-group services. This can be done by studying the organizational chart and the number and qualifications of the personnel who provide the services.\n\n7) Identify and/or confirm the types of assets used by the taxpayer, including land, buildings and machinery, use of valuable intangible assets, financial assets; and the nature of the assets that are used, including useful life, market value, location, and legal protection available for the intangible assets.\n\nThe following should be considered in identifying the use or existence of intangible assets:\n\na) The company obtains a higher profitability level than the average for similar industries;\n\nb) The existence of the intangible assets is not determined by whether or not the intangible assets are recorded in the balance sheet;\n\nExample 1:\n\nCosts in connection with research, development and marketing of a product are often not capitalized but instead charged as expense at the time they occur. These costs may not be reflected in the balance sheet as assets.\n\nc) The existence of intangible assets is not determined by whether or not they have legal protection.\n\nExample 2:\n\nIntangible assets relating to the production process in the form of patents are commonly registered, while those in the form of know-how are commonly not registered, because the company owning the know-how takes the view that this information should be kept confidential.\n\nBelow are the types of intangible assets and the steps to identify their existence.\n\na) Manufacturing intangibles\n\nManufacturing intangibles are generally created through research and development activities, which are risky and entail expenses, so that the developer seeks to obtain compensation for the expenditure in connection with these activities and to seek profit through the sale of goods, license agreements, or service contracts. The developer of the intangible assets may engage in the research and development activities by itself, or in the name of one or more members of the company group, in these ways:\n\n(1) based on a service contract, in its own name or that of one or more members of the company group; and\n\n(2) based on an agreement whereby the members involved in the joint activity will be the economic owners of the manufacturing intangibles.\n\nThe Revenue Officers need to take the following steps to identify the existence of manufacturing intangibles:\n\n(1) Perform research on contracts, such as licensing contracts or sale contracts for the intangible assets.\n\n(2) Review the FAR analysis table relating to manufacturing functions and intangible assets used that has been filled in by the taxpayer (Annex 6).\n\n(3) Check the taxpayer's organizational chart regarding manufacturing functions, key personnel, and job descriptions of the key personnel.\n\n(4) Conduct site visits and interviews with factory managers and manufacturing engineers to confirm whether or not there is know-how or patents used in the factory, as well as its economic benefit.\n\n(5) Identify existence of unique production equipment or modifications made to the production equipment that boosts quality or reduces production costs.\n\n(6) Identify any changes in factory design that reduce production costs or increase in output.\n\n(7) Obtain a list of patents and conduct interviews with research and development personnel (or key persons related to patents) to determine whether the patents are used or not, and also to determine the value of the patents if any. The Revenue Officers may request the opinions of expert regarding the value of the patents for the taxpayer.\n\n(8) Conduct interviews with research and development personnel to determine the company's level of success in the market (market power) produced by each such patent.\n\nb) Marketing intangibles\n\nMarketing intangibles include but are not limited to trademarks or trade names that help increase the marketing of goods and services, customers list, distribution channels, a unique name, symbol or picture that has important promotional value for the products.\n\nThe value of marketing intangibles depends on several factors, including the reputation and credibility of the brand or trade name, level of quality control and continuing research, distribution and availability of the goods and services that are marketed, success of promotion costs, and so on.\n\nThe Revenue Officers should do the following steps to identify the existence of marketing intangibles:\n\n(1) Conduct research on contracts relating to licenses (substance over form).\n\n(2) Review the FAR analysis table regarding marketing functions and intangible assets used that has been filled in by the taxpayer (Annex 6).\n\n(3) Check the taxpayer's organizational chart with regard to marketing function, key personnel and their job descriptions.\n\n(4) Conduct interviews with marketing/sales personnel to identify reasons for the products' success in the market.\n\n(5) Identify the existence of a series of activities that add value to the transaction.\n\nExample 3:\n\nStrategic planning activities in the field of marketing, advertising activities that have a long-term impact on a product, and so on.\n\n(6) Identify the existence of successful distribution channels that make it easy for consumers to purchase the products and/or services. If necessary, the Revenue Officers may request the opinions of experts regarding the reasons for the success of the taxpayer's product in the market.\n\n7. Map and/or confirm the risks borne by the taxpayer in connection with the affiliated transactions. This can be done by, for example, studying sale/purchase contracts, identifying write-off transactions, including those for uncollectible receivables, operating expenses in the form of loss from exchange rate differences, warranty expense, and inventory obsolescence. The Revenue Officers need to observe consistency between the party that bears the risk as stated in the contract and the facts and conditions in the field.\n\nIn performing FAR analysis, the Revenue Officers need to identify the taxpayer's contribution to the creation, development, protection and/or maintenance of the intangible assets. Factors that need to be considered in identifying the taxpayer's contribution include the following:\n\na) Existence of research and development costs or marketing costs;\n\nb) Existence of a function relating to research and development performed by the taxpayer;\n\nc) Existence of a function of marketing performed by the taxpayer;\n\nd) Existence of risks of research and development and/or marketing risks that are borne by the taxpayer;\n\ne) Existence of personnel with special qualifications who are employed in the functions of marketing, manufacturing, or research and development or other functions that determine the success of the taxpayer's products. These personnel can be identified from several factors, such as experience, educational background, income, performance evaluation, and duties of the personnel; and\n\nf) Existence of distribution channels and customers lists.\n\nThe contributions made by the taxpayer in connection with the success of its products should receive remuneration over and above the routine functions that are performed. Therefore, the reasonable range of the taxpayer's financial performance should be higher than the average for similar companies that do not have a contribution to intangible assets.\n\nAfter performing the FAR analysis, the Revenue Officers should be able to draw conclusions about the characteristics of the taxpayer's business and the functions performed by its related parties, and to examine the appropriateness of the remuneration received by the taxpayer and its related parties to the functions performed, assets used, and risks borne by each party.\n\nThe conclusion about the characteristics of the taxpayer's business may be in the form of toll manufacturing, contract manufacturing, fully fledged manufacturing, fully fledged distributor, limited risk distributor, commissionaire, commission agent, service provider or others.\n\nIn cases where there are some changes or developments in the business activities that may re-characterize the taxpayer's business, the Revenue Officers shall determine the adjustments based on the functions performed, assets used, and risk borne.\n\n2.) Selection of Transfer Pricing Method\n\nIn choosing the transfer pricing method (TPM), identifying the availability of comparables and determining the most appropriate transfer pricing method based on facts and condition are necessary.\n\na) Identify available comparables.\n\nOne of the important things in choosing TPM is the availability of reliable independent comparables. The purpose of this is to ensure availability and reliability of independent comparables to be applied. Comparables to be identified can be in the form of prices data (for example market prices for commodities), data on margin of gross profit, or data on margin of net profits. Comparables used to test transaction of the taxpayers with their related parties can be grouped into internal comparable and external comparable.\n\n1) Internal comparables\n\nInternal comparables are obtained when the tested party [4] engages in sale transactions or purchases of goods/services with unrelated parties, licensing of Intangible property to unrelated parties, imposition of interest rates/interest payments on loans to unrelated parties, etc. Factors that need to be confirmed in identifying reliable internal comparables include the following:\n\na) Ensure that the internal comparables are not transactions that were performed solely to justify that the related party transactions are at arm's length.\n\nExample 4:\n\nTMD Corp., a manufacturer of agricultural machinery, sells part of its product 3WG through LAC, Inc., its subsidiary in country X. In addition, TMD Corp., also sells a small amount of its product 3WG to FEL Ltd., an independent distributor in country Y. The economic conditions in country X and country Y are relatively similar. To use the sale transactions to FEL Ltd. as internal comparables, it must first be confirmed that these independent transactions are not performed solely to justify that the affiliated transactions are at arm's length.\n\n\"Performed solely\" means that FEL Ltd. is not economically dependent from its transaction with TMD Corp.\n\nb) Ensure that internal comparables are independent transactions performed in the normal course of business.\n\nExample 5:\n\nAt the start of the year, TMD Corp., a manufacturer of agricultural machinery, sells product 3WG to LAC, Inc., its subsidiary in country X. However, at the end of that year, TMD Corp. goes bankrupt and has to liquidate its inventory by selling all its product 3WG at a liquidation price. Because this liquidation sale is not conducted under normal business conditions, the sales of TMD Corp. at the time of the liquidation cannot be used as an independent comparable in determining the fair price of TMD Corp.'s products to LAC, Inc.\n\nc) Ensure comparability between the related party transactions and the internal comparables by considering the five (5) comparability factors as enumerated in RR No. 2-2013:\n\n1. Characteristics of goods and services;\n\n2. FAR analysis;\n\n3. Contractual forms;\n\n4. Economic circumstances; and\n\n5. Business strategies.\n\n2) External comparables\n\nThe external comparables that can be used to test the arm's length nature of related party transactions may be in the form of the following but not limited to:\n\na) market price of commodity products or price of similar goods/services traded by unrelated parties, such as gold, silver, crude palm oil (CPO), coal, and other commodity products;\n\nb) Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas Offered Rate (BSP);\n\nc) Philippine Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) database; and\n\nd) Commercial databases (i.e., orbis, oreana, onesource, speeda).\n\nb) Choose the TPM that is Most Appropriate to the Facts and Conditions\n\nFactors that need to be considered in selecting the TPM that is most appropriate to the facts and conditions include the following:\n\n1) advantages and disadvantages of each method;\n\n2) appropriateness of the TPM to the basic nature of the transaction, determined based on FAR analysis;\n\n3) availability of reliable information (in connection with independent comparables) to apply the method that is chosen and/or other methods; and\n\n4) level of comparability between the related party transaction and the transactions between independent parties, including reliability of adjustments made to eliminate the material influence of any differences.\n\nTo choose the most appropriate method in a transfer pricing case, it needs information in respect of factors of comparability on related transactions in examination process, especially information on FAR of all related parties entering into transaction with taxpayer, including related party existing abroad.\n\nSelection of tested party is carried on based on functional analysis already prepared and reliability of data/proofs/information as well as facts obtained in audit. The Revenue Officer can choose taxpayer which is being audited as tested party. The Revenue Officer can also choose counterpart of audited taxpayer as tested party.\n\nFactors that require attention in choosing the tested party include the following:\n\n\u2022 The tested party is generally the party that has the less complex functions, for example, the party that does not have unique/valuable intangible property;\n\n\u2022 If the tested party is located abroad, the Revenue Officers should confirm the reliability of the information regarding the tested party, for example by requesting data/information on financial statements or other data from the taxpayer and/or performing an exchange of information with the competent authority in the country concerned; and\n\n\u2022 If the Revenue Officers cannot confirm the reliability and adequacy of information of a related party located abroad that was to be tested, the Revenue Officers can select the taxpayer or another related party as the tested party.\n\n3.) Application of the Arm's Length Principle [5] (ALP)\n\nApplying the ALP is conducted after choosing the most appropriate TPM and should consider the following:\n\na. Performing Comparability Analysis\n\nAudit on transfer pricing is made by comparing condition of related transactions and condition of independent transaction. Related transaction is deemed comparable with independent transaction in the event that:\n\na.1 Difference (if any) between condition of affiliated transactions and condition of independent transaction has no material influence to prices or profits;\n\na.2 Accurate reliable adjustment can be conducted to eliminate material influence.\n\nb. Increasing Scope of Comparability\n\nTo compare condition in related transactions to condition of independent transaction, economically relevant characteristics of condition compared must be comparable adequately so that the comparison is more accurate. In the event that condition of related transactions is not comparable with condition of independent transaction, expansion of scope of comparability can be conducted by ways, among other things:\n\nb.1 Criteria of Manual Searching and Selection\n\nTo generate reliable comparable, date searching in commercial database must use right searching strategy/searching criteria, among other things:\n\nb.1.1 Code of industry in accordance with the audited taxpayer;\n\nb.1.2 Region;\n\nb.1.3 Availability of data; and\n\nb.1.4 Indicator of financial statement.\n\nFollowing the data searching through the searching strategy, one or more data of company to be made as comparable will be obtained. However, data obtained from commercial database only constitute candidate comparable. The candidate comparable chosen must undergo manual selection process (manual review/manual screening) that can be decided whether the candidate comparable is used (reliable) or rejected.\n\nManual selection is made by learning profile of every company becoming candidate comparable, seeing in its website, searching information relating to the candidate comparable in printed media or online or other methods.\n\nThe criteria to reject candidate comparable, among other things, are as follows:\n\n1) General Review\n\nThe purpose of the general review is to select companies that have data or information available to further testing and those that meet basic comparability requirements such as independence, product and business activity similarities. The Table below summarizes the general review.\n\nRejection Criteria\n\nDescription\n\nNumber of companies remaining after applying the criterion\n\nActive\n\nReject companies that are no longer active or are dormant since they do not have economic activity\n\nCorporate Structure\n\nReject companies that are not listed as a stock corporation, i.e., the companies' legal form is either a limited or general partnership.\n\nAvailable information\n\nReject companies that do not have financial information for at least 2 of the 3 years of the tested period. Reject companies that do not have sufficient information based on internet research.\n\nProduct and business activity\n\nReview the main business activity of the companies and the products that they deal with.\n\nIndependence\n\nReject companies that have the following:\n\n(a) Companies which are owned by another by more than 25% of its total shareholding; or\n\n(b) Companies which have related party transactions that are more than 20% of the relevant threshold.\n\nConsecutive losses\n\nReject companies that are not comparable due to the volatility of their profitability as evidenced or shown by consecutive years of losses incurred.\n\nOther rejection reason\n\nReject companies that declared affidavit of non-operation and discontinued commercial operations, newly registered companies, companies that have no business description or have insufficient data.\n\n2) Financial Review\n\nThe financial information of the remaining companies is placed under further scrutiny to ensure that the companies perform the same FAR. The table below summarizes the steps below.\n\nRejection Criteria\n\nDescription\n\nNumber of companies remaining after applying the criterion\n\nLevel of revenue\n\nReject companies whose revenue level exceeds 10 times higher or lower than the tested revenue level, indicating the company's scale of operations may be different from the tested party.\n\nLevel of research and development expenses\n\nReject companies whose ratio of research and development expenses to sales exceed 3%\n\nLevel of intangible assets to total assets\n\nReject companies whose ratio of intangible assets to total assets exceed 3%.\n\nb.2 Use of Multiple Year Data\n\nTo obtain a complete understanding of the facts and circumstances surrounding a controlled transaction, [6] it is useful to examine from both the years after the year under examination and prior years. The use of data from past years will show whether a taxpayer's reported loss on a transaction is part of a history of losses on similar transactions, a result of a particular economic condition in a prior year that caused an increase in cost in the subsequent year, or a reflection of the fact that a product is at the end of its life cycle.\n\nb.3 Use of an Interquartile Range [7]\n\nIn some case it will be possible to apply the arm's length principle to arrive at a single figure (e.g., price of margin) that is the most reliable to establish whether the conditions of a transaction are at arm's length. However, because transfer pricing is not an exact science, there will be many occasions when the application of the most appropriate method or methods produces a range of figures all of which are relatively equally reliable. This is often the case in practice where the comparables are extracted from a database. In such cases, if the range includes a sizeable number of observations, statistical tools that take account of central tendency to narrow the range (e.g., the interquartile range or other percentiles) might help to enhance the reliability of the analysis.\n\nThe end result of the financial data analysis after performing FAR of the selected comparables are summarized in an interquartile range. The median is the midpoint of the interquartile range. The median will generally produce a different result to the average of the range being considered.\n\nIn these cases, differences in the figures that comprise the range may be caused by the fact that in general the application of the arm's length principle only produces an approximation of conditions that would have been established between independent enterprises. It is also possible that the different points in a range represent the fact that independent enterprises engaged in comparable transactions under comparable circumstances may not establish exactly the same price for the transaction.\n\nIt may also be the case that, while every effort has been made to exclude points that have a lesser degree of comparability, what is arrived at is a range of figures for which is considered, given the process used for selecting comparables and limitations in information available on comparables, that some comparability defects remain that cannot be identified and/or quantified, and are therefore not adjusted.\n\nIf the relevant conditions of the controlled transactions (e.g., price or margin) are within the arm's length range, no adjustment should be made.\n\nIf the relevant conditions of the controlled transaction (e.g., price or margin) fall outside the arm's length range asserted by the BIR, the taxpayer should have the opportunity to present arguments that the conditions of the controlled transaction satisfy the arm's length principle, and that the result falls within the arm's length range (i.e., that the arm's length range is different from the one asserted by the BIR). If the taxpayer is unable to establish this fact, the BIR must determine the point within the arm's length range to which it will adjust the conditions of the controlled transaction.\n\nb.4 Comparability Adjustment\n\nMeasures on comparability adjustment are taken if there is difference of conditions that influence condition (prices or profits) materially between related transactions and independent transaction. Comparability adjustment can be in the form of adjustment of difference of contractual terms, etc.\n\nIf reasonably accurate adjustment cannot be done, then test of ALP at related transactions should be conducted by using other TPM that is most appropriate with facts and conditions.\n\nWhere the Revenue Officer has found that a price in a controlled transaction is not at arm's length, he may make an adjustment to reflect the arm's length price or interest rate for the transaction by substituting or imputing the price, or interest, as the case may be. In such instances, the adjustment will also be reflected by a corresponding adjustment upon request of the other party of the controlled transactions. Adjustments will be made where:\n\n1) For the supply of property/goods or services, the consideration is less than the consideration that would have been received or receivable in an arm's length arrangement;\n\n2) For the acquisition of property/goods or services, the consideration is more than the consideration that would have been given or agreed to be given in an arm's length arrangement; or\n\n3) No consideration has been charged to the related/associated party for the supply or services.\n\nb.5 Losses\n\nCompanies incur losses for variety of economic and business reasons such as startup losses, market penetration strategies, and research and development failure. However, an independent company would not endure continuous losses without taking appropriate measures to correct the situation within reasonable time, as it would contradict fundamental business objectives of making profits. The fact that related/associated company continuously suffers losses may be an indication that is not being compensated fairly.\n\nIn determining whether the losses are acceptable, it is important to ensure that the controlled transaction entered into is commercially realistic and make economic sense. A taxpayer needs to establish that the losses are commercial in nature within the context of its characterization. In this regard, a taxpayer is expected to maintain contemporaneous documentation which outlines the non-transfer pricing factors that have contributed to the losses.\n\nA contract or toll manufacturer that only carries out production as ordered by a related party, without performing functions such as operational strategy setting, product R&D and sales, is expected to maintain a consistent level of profitability. Should the manufacturer suffer from losses, it must prove that these losses are not a result of its transactions with a related party.\n\nb.6 Separate and Combined Transactions Approach\n\nTo obtain the most precise approximation of arm's length price or profit allocation, the ALP should ideally be applied on a transaction-by-transaction basis. However, depending on the circumstances of the case, transfer pricing may sometimes need to be dealt with at the level of a product or business unit rather than at the level of each particular transaction.\n\nIn establishing transfer prices, taxpayers should set prices separately for each transaction they enter into with a related/associated person. However, where transactions are so closely linked (or continuous) that they cannot be evaluated adequately on a separate basis, determination of transfer price based on bundled transactions may be considered. This is provided if it can be demonstrated that it is the normal industry practice to set one price for a combination of transactions (e.g., goods and the associated intangible property) or where it may be reasonable to expect to find quality data available to set the price for separate transactions. Lack of reliable data on comparable transactions may be due to the complexity of the dealings or the relationships between the parties. Therefore, the total amount may be on an aggregate basis.\n\nIt is generally accepted to group intangible associated with the product or service provided if comparable independent transactions also have these various transactions which cannot be disaggregated and are bundled into a package deal with all the associated costs being included in the price of the product.\n\nExample 6:\n\nAggregation of transaction involving tangible and intangible products that are highly integrated.\n\nA company that licenses a manufacturing know-how and supplies vital components that are highly integrated to a related/associated party may find it more reasonable to assess the arm's length price for these two activities as an item instead of separately.\n\nExample 7:\n\nAggregation of transactions where one product complements the other.\n\nAggregation of transactions may also be appropriate in situations where a taxpayer is required to carry an unprofitable product or line of products which are auxiliary to the profitable items and where there is sufficient profit available to provide an adequate return from the complete product range to reward the FAR of the company. Common types of bundled products that fall under this category include printers with cartridges, and razors with blade.\n\nExample 8:\n\nDisaggregation of transactions where the nature of transactions is substantially different.\n\nCompany LAC was established in the Philippines to handle distribution, sales, after-sales service, repair, and maintenance services of the TMD group vehicles consisting of trucks, buses and coaches which are 100% imported from its parent company in the US. Company LAC is also the regional hub for TMD in South East Asia, covering markets such as Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam and Malaysia. This regional office also houses the regional training center where mechanics, technicians, driver trainers and managers from Asia Pacific region are trained to provide TMD's group customers in the region.\n\nOrdinarily, in this situation, the various kinds of activities should not be aggregated and Company LAC is required to prepare segmental accounts as follows, in order to enable the evaluation of the arm's length nature of the controlled transactions on a transactional basis:\n\n\u2022 Sales and distribution\n\n\u2022 Repair and maintenance services\n\n\u2022 Regional service\n\nb.7 Re-characterization of Transactions\n\nExamination of a controlled transaction ordinarily should be based on the transaction actually undertaken by the taxpayer insofar as they are consistent with the methods described in the Guidelines. However, when reviewing an agreement between related/associated parties, consideration is not only on the terms of the agreement but also the actual conduct of the parties.\n\nTherefore, in determining an arm's length price, the Revenue Officer may disregard and re-characterize a controlled transaction under the following circumstances:\n\n(a) Where the economic substance of a transaction differs from its form; or\n\n(b) Where the form and substance of a transaction are the same, the arrangements made in relation to the transaction when viewed in their totality, differ from those which would have been adopted by independent persons behaving in commercially rational manner and this actual structure practically impedes the BIR from determining an appropriate transfer price.\n\nThe need to re-characterize a transaction is based on the rationale that the character of the transactions is derived from the relationship between the parties and is not determined by normal conditions. The controlled transaction may have been structured by the taxpayer to avoid or minimize tax. This is supported by the fact that \u2014\n\n(a) Related/associated parties are able to enter into a greater variety of contracts and agreements compared to independent persons because the normal conflict of interest which exist between independent parties is often absent;\n\n(b) Associated persons often conclude arrangements of a specific nature that are not, or very rarely, encountered between independent persons; and\n\n(c) Contracts under a controlled transaction are quite easily altered, suspended, extended, or terminated according to the overall strategies of the multinational group as a whole and such alteration may even be made retroactively.\n\nExample 9:\n\nAn investment in a related/associated company in the form of interest-bearing debt would not be expected to be structured in the same way had it been conducted at arm's length, given the economic circumstances of the borrowing company. In this case, it might be appropriate for a tax administration to characterize the investment in accordance with its economic substance where the loan may be treated as subscription of capital.\n\nExample 10:\n\nA sale under a long term contract, for a lump sum payment, gives unlimited entitlement to the intellectual property rights arising as a result of future research for the term of the contract. While it may be proper to respect the transaction as a transfer of commercial property, it would nevertheless be appropriate for a tax administration to conform the terms of that transfer in its entirety to that which might reasonably have been expected between independent persons. Thus, in the case described above, it might be appropriate for the tax administration, for example, to adjust the conditions of the agreement in a commercially rationale manner as a continuing research agreement.\n\nC. REPORTING OF AUDIT ON TRANSFER PRICING\n\nThe report should include the following:\n\n\u2022 Executive Summary\n\n\u2022 Factual Background and Functional Analysis of the Taxpayer and the Transaction(s) at Issue\n\n\u2022 Summary of Taxpayer's Proposed Economic Analysis for the Transaction at Issue\n\n\u2022 Critique Taxpayer's Methodology and Analysis for the Transaction at Issue\n\n\u2022 Revenue Officer's Determination of Arm's Length Price based Upon Economic Analysis\n\n\u2022 Summary and Conclusion\n\nThe Revenue Officers shall meet with the taxpayer to discuss the audit findings of all issues prior to finalizing the report. Discussions are to focus on:\n\n\u2022 Understanding the taxpayer's position\n\n\u2022 Determining whether the taxpayer agrees with the facts\n\n\u2022 Determining whether the taxpayer would agree to any issues\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nTransfer Pricing Audit Method\n\nAudit of transfer pricing on taxpayer's transaction with their related/associated parties can be conducted by performing test of prices or profits whether at level of gross profit or at level of net operating income. After making comparability analysis, test of application of ALP is performed by applying TPM.\n\nTransactions of Sale or Purchase of Goods/Services\n\nTo test sales or purchases of goods/service, the Revenue Officers can use the TPM that is most appropriate to the facts and conditions. Below is a description of the steps to apply the arm's length principle in accordance with the method that was chosen.\n\n1) Comparable Uncontrolled Price (CUP) Method\n\nThe CUP Method evaluates whether the amount charged in a controlled transaction is at arm's length by reference to the amount charged in a comparable uncontrolled transaction in comparable circumstances. Any difference between the two prices may indicate that the conditions of the commercial and financial relations of the associated enterprises [8] are not arm's length, and that the price in the uncontrolled transaction may need to be substituted for the price in the controlled transaction.\n\nThe CUP method is applied by comparing the prices of goods or services in related party transactions with the prices of goods or services in independent transactions. Application of the CUP method to transactions of sale or purchase of goods/services is done using the following steps:\n\n(a) Perform Comparability Analysis\n\nBefore price comparison is done, the Revenue Officers must first confirm the comparability between the related party transactions and independent transactions. Below is an explanation of the comparability factors that must be noted in testing related party transactions using the CUP method.\n\n(i) Characteristics of the Goods and Services\n\nIn performing the comparability analysis, it must be understood that minor differences in the characteristics of goods and services can have a material influence on the price of the goods and services. Therefore, the comparability of the goods or services is an important factor that needs to be considered in the CUP method compared with the application of other TPMs.\n\n(ii) FAR Analysis\n\nIn addition to the characteristics of the goods and services, comparability of the functions performed, assets used and risks involved between the related transactions and the independent transactions has also material influence on the price of goods and services. Generally, significant differences in function, assets, and risks will reflect a difference in the expected return.\n\nAside from the characteristics of the products and the FAR analysis, differences in contractual terms, business strategy, and economic conditions are also important comparability factors that need to be considered when applying the CUP method.\n\nAfter performing comparability analysis, comparison of the prices of goods or services in related party transactions and the prices of goods or services in independent transactions can be done. There are two ways to compare prices of goods or services which are direct and indirect comparison:\n\n(a) Direct comparison is done if there are no differences in conditions between the related party transactions and independent transactions that materially influence the prices of the goods and services, so adjustments can be made directly for any differences in the prices of the goods and services.\n\n(b) Indirect comparison is done if there are differences in conditions between the related party transactions and the independent transactions that materially influence the price of the goods and services, and reasonably accurate adjustments can be made to eliminate this material influence.\n\n(b) Increase Comparability\n\nIncreasing comparability is done when there are differences in conditions between related party transactions and independent transactions that materially influence the prices of the goods and services. The purpose of increasing comparability is to eliminate that material influence.\n\nIncreasing comparability in the CUP method is done by making reasonably accurate adjustments for the differences in conditions between the related party transactions and the independent transactions.\n\nExample 11:\n\nTaxpayer TMD, a MNE, sells 60% of its product to an associated company WSR, at a price of P100 per unit. At the same time, the remaining 40% is sold to an independent enterprise ASG at P150 per unit.\n\nThe products sold to WSR and ASG are the same, and the transaction between TMD and ASG may be considered as a comparable uncontrolled transaction. However, FAR of WSR and ASG must first be carried out to determine any differences. If there are differences, adjustments must be made to account for these differences. Adjustments must also be made to account for product quantity discounts since volume of sales to WSR and ASG are different. Assuming there are no material differences that require adjustments to be made, the CUP may be applied using the unit price of P150 as a comparable arm's length price.\n\nExample 12:\n\nControlled transaction\n\nManufacturer TMD exports its product to associate company WSR. Manufacturer FEL exports the same product, in similar quantities and under similar terms to company LAC, an independent party operating in similar markets as WSR. The uncontrolled sales price is a delivered price whereas the controlled sales are made FOB factory. These differences in terms of transportation and duties have an effect on price. Therefore, adjustments should be made on the uncontrolled transaction to eliminate the differences.\n\nSelling Price FEL to LAC\n\nP150\n\nLess:\n\nAdjustment for freight\n\nP10\n\nAdjustment for duties\n\n5\n\nTotal adjustments\n\n(15)\n\nArm's length price TMD to WSR\n\nP135\n\n2) Resale Price Method (RPM)\n\nRPM is applied where a product that has been purchased from a related party is resold to an independent party. Essentially, it seeks to value the functions performed by the reseller of a product. The resale price method evaluates whether the amount charged in a controlled transaction is at arm's length by reference to the gross profit margin realized in comparable uncontrolled transactions.\n\nThe usefulness of the method largely depends on how much added value or alteration the reseller has done on the product before it is resold, or the time lapse between purchase and onward sale. Thus, RPM is most appropriate in a situation where the reseller adds relatively little value to the properties.\n\nThe resale price method is a transfer pricing method that determines the purchase price of goods from related parties by deducting the gross profit of comparable independent parties from the resale price of the goods to the independent parties. Application of the Resale Price Method in transactions of purchase of goods is done through the following steps:\n\na) Perform Comparability Analysis\n\nIn applying the Resale Price Method, attention must be given to the comparability factors between the related party transactions and the independent transactions, including the following:\n\n(i) Characteristics of Goods\n\nIn applying the resale price method, differences in the characteristics of goods generally do not have a material influence on the gross margin.\n\nExample 13:\n\nA company that distributes toasters and a company that distributes blenders have comparable FAR, so these two distributor companies should have comparable levels of gross margin for their sales of toasters and blenders.\n\nIn applying the resale price method, although differences in the goods can be tolerated, the comparability of the characteristics of goods must still be considered. Extreme differences in the characteristics of goods tend to indicate the existence of differences in FAR which have a material influence on the gross margin.\n\n(ii) FAR Analysis\n\nIn the resale price method, comparability of the FAR between the related party transactions and the independent transactions receives a greater emphasis than the comparability of the characteristics of goods. Related party transactions and independent transactions can be considered non-comparable when there are significant differences in FAR. Generally, significant differences in FAR reflect differences in the expected return.\n\n(iii) Consistency of Accounting Standards\n\nAnother important matter in applying the resale price method is consistency of the accounting standards between the related party transactions and the independent transactions. Among the aspects of consistency of accounting standards that need to be noted is uniformity in classification of expenses.\n\n(iv) No Significant Added Value to the Product\n\nGenerally, this method will be more appropriate to use if the reseller does not add any significant value to the products that are sold.\n\n(v) Intangible Assets That May be Generated\n\nIf a distributor performs extensive marketing activities (for example, creation of distribution channels or very high promotion/advertising expenses), it can be said that the distributor may have become the economic owner of intangible assets (economic ownership) in connection with the extensive marketing activities. Generally, this method will be more appropriate to use if the distributor does not engage in extensive marketing activities.\n\n(vi) Existence of Exclusive Rights\n\nIf a distributor obtains exclusive rights for selling the goods, this can influence the gross margin. These exclusive rights are influenced by several factors, such as size of the territory and existence of competitors. Generally, this method will be more appropriate to use if the distributor does not have exclusive rights.\n\n(vii) Other Comparability Factors\n\nDifferences in contractual terms, business strategy, and economic conditions are also important comparability factors in applying the resale price method. After performing the comparability analysis, the Revenue Officers compare the gross margin of the related party transactions with the gross margin of the independent transactions. There are two ways to compare gross margin:\n\n(a) Direct comparison: if, based on the comparability analysis, there are no differences in conditions between the related party transactions and the independent transactions that materially influence the gross margin, the arm's length purchase price can be determined from the difference in gross margin. Adjustments are then made for the difference between the fair purchase price and the purchase price with related parties.\n\n(b) Indirect comparison is done when, based on the comparability analysis, there are differences in conditions between the related party transactions and the independent transactions that materially influence gross margin, so reasonably accurate adjustments are made to eliminate this material influence in conditions in order to derive the reasonable purchase price.\n\nb) Increase Comparability\n\nIncreasing comparability is done when there are differences in conditions between related party transactions and independent transactions that materially influence the gross margin. The purpose of increasing comparability is to eliminate this material influence on the gross margin. Comparability can be increased by making reasonably accurate adjustments, using multiple-year data, aggregating transactions, and using manual search and selection criteria.\n\nIf it is difficult to make reasonably accurate adjustments, the Revenue Officers need to consider using another transfer pricing method that is more appropriate to the facts and conditions.\n\nExample 14:\n\nTaxpayer TMD, a distributor, is a Philippine subsidiary of multinational WSR, which is located overseas. WSR distributes high quality product manufactured by WSR. WSR also sells similar product of a lower quality to an independent distributor FEL in Philippines. The cost of product purchased from WSR by TMD is P7.60 per unit. TMD resells the product to independent party for P8.00. A functional analysis shows that TMD and FEL perform similar function. The gross profit ratio of FEL was found to be 10%.\n\nIn this example, it is noted that there are product (quality) differences when comparing the controlled and uncontrolled transactions. However, since the focus of comparison is on margins, the differences are not as material as they would have been if the basis of the comparison were on the prices. Furthermore, TMD and FEL carry out similar functions (FEL being another reseller in the same market), thus the resale price margin of 10% will be used as basis to determine the arm's length price for the original purchase by TMD from WSR.\n\nArm's length price of product purchased (in Php) = 8 \u2013 (8 x 10%) = P7.20.\n\nExample 15:\n\nPhilCo distributed laptop computers in the Philippines for its overseas parent company, PCo. Company C, a Philippine company unrelated to PCo, has also been appointed by PCo to distribute desktop computers in the Philippines. In this example, it is assumed that the laptop and desktop markets are similar in the Philippines. The main difference between the two distributorship agreements is that PhilCo performs promotional and marketing functions for PCo whereas Company C does not.\n\nThe gross profit margin of Company C from the resale of desktops to consumers was found to be 10%.\n\nThe arm's length price for the related party transaction is computed as follows:\n\nPhilCo's sales of laptop to unrelated parties\n\nP3,500\n\nLess: Arm's length resale price margin based on Company C's transactions (10% x 3,500)\n\n(P350)\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\n\nP3,150\n\nLess: Adjustment for marketing costs\n\n(P80)\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\n\nTransfer price (based on resale price method)\n\nP3,070\n\n======\n\nThe above example is based on an internal comparable i.e., PCo's transactions with Company C (an independent party) is used to benchmark the transactions with PhilCo (a related party). The same analysis could be undertaken using external comparables i.e., benchmarking the related party transactions between PCo and PhilCo against comparable transactions between an independent manufacturer and distributor.\n\n3) Cost Plus Method (CPM)\n\nCPM focuses on the gross mark-up obtained by a supplier who transfers property or provides services to a related purchaser. Essentially, the method attempts to value the functions performed by the supplier of the property or services. CPM is most useful where semi-finished goods are sold between associated enterprises or where the controlled transaction involves the provision of services.\n\nThis method is often useful in cases involving the manufacture, assembly, or other production of goods that are sold to related parties or where controlled transaction involves the provision of intra-group services.\n\nThe starting point in CPM is the cost incurred by the supplier of property or services in a controlled transaction for property transferred or services provided to a related purchaser. An appropriate mark-up is added to this cost to find the price that the supplier should be charging the buyer.\n\nThe Cost Plus Method is a transfer pricing method that adds the gross profit from comparable independent transactions to the costs borne in related party transactions. Application of the cost plus Method to transactions of sales of goods/services is done using the following steps:\n\na) Perform Comparability Analysis\n\nIn applying the cost plus method, attention must be given to the comparability factors between related party transactions and independent transactions, including the following:\n\n(i) Characteristics of Goods and services\n\nIn the cost plus method, differences in the characteristics of goods and services generally do not have a material influence on the gross mark-up.\n\nExample 16:\n\nA company manufacturing toasters and a company manufacturing irons have comparable FAR, so these two manufacturing companies should have comparable levels of gross mark-up. Comparison of the toaster manufacturer and the iron manufacturer is done on the assumption that there is no reliable toaster manufacturer. Although differences in goods or services can be tolerated, the comparability of the characteristics of goods and services between the related party transactions and the independent transactions still requires attention. Excessive differences in the characteristics of goods and services tend to indicate the existence of differences in FAR that have a material influence on the mark-up.\n\n(ii) FAR Analysis\n\nIn the Cost Plus Method, comparability of FAR between related party transactions and independent transactions is emphasized more than comparability of the characteristics of goods and services. Related party transactions and independent transactions can be considered non-comparable if there are significant differences in FAR. Generally, significant differences in risks reflect differences in the expected return.\n\nExample 17:\n\nAfter performing FAR analysis, when engaging in transactions with its parent company that owns intangible assets, TMD Corp. functions as a manufacturer with limited functions and risks (contract manufacturing) that does not bear market risk, while when engaging in transactions with unrelated parties, TMD Corp. functions as a fully-fledged manufacturer that bears market risk. In this case, there are differences in FAR and expected return between the affiliated transactions and the independent transactions that have a material influence on the gross markup.\n\nIn this scenario, independent transaction of TMD Corp. cannot be used as internal comparable because of the material differences in its functions and risks.\n\n(iii) Consistency of Accounting Standards\n\nAnother important aspect in the use of the cost plus method is that the gross mark-ups that are compared have a connection with the cost base, so when testing related party transactions using the cost plus method, the Revenue Officers need to confirm the comparability of the cost bases. With regard to the cost base, consistency of cost structure is an important aspect. There may be differences in accounting treatment between countries, and even between companies in the same country.\n\n(iv) Other Comparability Factors\n\nDifferences in contractual terms, business strategy, and economic conditions are also important comparability factors in applying the cost plus method. The Revenue Officers compare the gross mark-up of related party transactions and the gross mark-up of independent transactions after performing comparability analysis. There are two ways to compare gross mark-up:\n\n(1) Direct comparison: if the comparability analysis does not find differences in conditions between the related party transactions and the independent transactions that materially influence the gross mark-up, the reasonable price can be determined from the difference in gross mark-up and adjustments can be made on the difference between the reasonable selling price and the selling price from related parties.\n\n(2) Indirect comparison is used when, based on the comparability analysis, there are differences in the conditions between the related party transactions and the independent transactions that materially influence the gross mark-up, and so reasonably accurate adjustments are made to eliminate this material influence in order to obtain the reasonable selling price.\n\nb) Increasing comparability\n\nIncreasing comparability is done when there are differences in the conditions between related party transactions and independent transactions that materially influence the gross mark-up. The purpose of increasing comparability is to eliminate this material influence on the gross mark-up. Increasing comparability in the cost plus method is generally done by making reasonably accurate adjustments, using multiple-year data, aggregating transactions, and using manual search and selection criteria.\n\n4) Transactional Net Margin Method (TNMM)\n\nTNMM operates in a manner similar to the cost plus and resale price methods in the sense that it uses the margin approach. This method examines the net profit margin relative to an appropriate base such as costs, sales or assets attained by the member of a group of controlled taxpayers from a controlled transaction.\n\nThe primary difference between TNMM and RPM or CPM is that the former focuses on the net margin instead of the gross margin of a transaction. However, one of the weaknesses of using net margin as the basis for comparison is that it can be influenced by many factors that either do not have an effect, or have a less substantial or direct effect, on price or gross margins. Examples of such factors include the efficiency of plant and machinery used, management and personal capabilities, competitive position, etc. Unless reliable and accurate adjustments can be made to account for these differences, TNMM may not produce reliable measures of the arm's length net margins.\n\nTNMM is usually appropriate to use when the gross profit of the business is not easy to determine such that either CPM, in case of a manufacturer/service-provider, or RPM, in case of a distributor, cannot be used. Since the net margin figure is always available, TNMM may be used instead, applying the same formula as those for CPM (for manufacturer/service provider) or RPM (for distributor) but rather using net margin in lieu of the gross margin/profit.\n\nThe Transactional Net Margin Method is a transfer pricing method that uses the indicator of profit level in comparable independent transactions to determine the net operating profit of related party transactions. Application of the Transactional Net Margin Method in transactions of purchase/sale of tangible goods and services are done using the following steps:\n\na) Select the Profit Level Indicator (PLI) that is most appropriate to the facts and conditions.\n\nThe PLI is shown in the form of a ratio between net operating profit and sales, total costs, assets, etc.\n\nDetermination of the denominator used in the TNMM is done by considering the company's profit drivers and their independence from the denominator that is used. Other factors that need to be considered in selecting the PLI are the type of business and the availability of data. Service provider companies, manufacturers and the like generally use net operating profit compared with total cost as the PLI. In contrast, distribution activities generally use net operating profit compared with sales.\n\nThe ratios generally used as PLI are net margin, net markup, and return on assets (ROA).\n\n(1) Ratio of Level of Return on Sales (Net Margin)\n\nNet Margin is calculated using the following formula:\n\nNet Margin\n\n=\n\nNet Operating Profit\n\nx 100%\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\n\nSales\n\n(2) Ratio of Level of Return on Total Costs (Net Mark-up)\n\nNet Mark-up is calculated using the following formula:\n\nNet Mark-up\n\n=\n\nNet Operating Profit\n\nx 100%\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\n\nCOGS + Operating Costs\n\n(3) Ratio of Return on Assets (ROA)\n\nROA is calculated using the following formulas:\n\nROA\n\n=\n\nNet Operating Profit\n\nx 100%\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\n\nTotal Operating Assets\n\nROA\n\n=\n\nNet Operating Profit\n\nx 100%\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\n\nTotal Assets \u2013 Non-Operating Assets Including Cash\n\nTotal operating assets include operating fixed assets (including land, buildings, plant and equipment), intangible assets used in the business (such as patents or know-how), and working capital assets (such as inventory and trade receivables less trade payables). Investments and cash are not included in operating assets unless the company operates in the financial services industry.\n\na) Increase Comparability\n\nIncreasing comparability in the TNMM includes:\n\n(1) Manual Search and Selection Criteria\n\nWhen the comparable companies used are external comparables, the search for comparables can be done using publicly available data, such as commercial databases. Searching using a commercial database can be done through a search using certain specific criteria (a searching strategy), such as an industry code in accordance with the Taxpayer being audited, region, availability of data, and financial statement indicators.\n\nAfter conducting a data search using a particular searching strategy, data on one or more companies will be obtained that can be used as comparables. However, the data obtained from a commercial database are only candidate comparables. The candidate comparables that have been selected must then undergo a process of manual review/manual screening so that it can be decided whether the candidate comparables are used (reliable) or rejected.\n\nThis manual screening can be done by studying the profiles of the companies that are candidate comparables, looking at their websites, seeking information about the candidate comparables from print or media online, or other methods. Manual screening can be done quantitatively and qualitatively.\n\n(2) Use of Multiple-Year Data\n\nMultiple-year data are used when they can improve the results of the comparability analysis. Analysis of multiple-year data can improve the process of screening of candidate comparables, for example by identifying comparables with significant differences from the tested party. In certain cases, this can lead to rejection of a candidate comparable or the detection of anomalies in candidate comparables. The use of multiple-year data in comparability analysis does not mean that the determination of the fair price or profit uses the average performance of multiple-year data.\n\n(3) Per Transaction or Combined Transaction Approach\n\nTesting of related party transactions can be done per transaction or by combining transactions, considering the facts and conditions. Testing of combined related party transactions is more appropriate, for example, when the transactions are closely linked or continuous. Examples of application of testing of combined transactions:\n\n(a) Transactions arising from a long-term contract for supply of commodities or services;\n\n(b) Use of intangible property intrinsic in a product;\n\n(c) Determination of prices of closely linked products; and\n\n(d) The company applies a pricing strategy focused on a portfolio approach by minimizing the profit from certain products in order to maximize the profit on other related products, for example the pricing of printers and of cartridges.\n\n5) Profit Split Method (PSM)\n\nThe PSM is a transfer pricing method that splits the combined profit between the related parties involved in related party transactions based on the contributions they make. The profit split method is used in cases involving highly integrated operations or where both parties make a unique and highly valuable contribution (for example, contribution of unique/valuable intangible properly) so that the testing cannot be done separately.\n\nPSM seeks to eliminate the effect on profits of special conditions made or imposed in a controlled transaction (or in controlled transactions that are appropriate to aggregate) by determining the division of profits (or losses) that independent enterprises would have expected to realize from engaging in the transaction or transactions.\n\nTwo profit split methods are commonly used: The Contribution Profit Split Method and the Residual Profit Split Method.\n\nBelow are the techniques for testing the reasonableness of transactions using these methods:\n\na) Contribution Profit Split Method\n\nThe Contribution Profit Split Method is applied when transactions occur between parties that are closely integrated. This method is also known as one-stage analysis.\n\nThe steps in applying the Contribution Profit Split Method include the following:\n\n(1) Combine the net operating profit of the parties as a single unit.\n\n(2) Determine the FAR that contribute to the net operating profit.\n\n(3) Identify external data.\n\nBefore performing the weighing of the functions, the Revenue Officers can performance analysis of external market data (for example, from joint ventures) that reflects how independent parties allocate profit in comparable conditions. If no data are available; the Revenue Officers may use internal data (including financial data) to perform the weighing. Analysis of contributions is done based on a detailed analysis of whether the FAR that are used in allocating profit are economically acceptable/justified.\n\n(4) Perform Weighing of Functions and Determine Percentage Shares of Profit.\n\nThe weighing is based on the relative values of the functions performed and the economic contributions of each of the affiliated parties in the transactions. The relative values of the functions performed may be associated with costs expended, assets used, etc.\n\n(5) Allocate profit in accordance with the weight of the contribution of each affiliated party.\n\nAfter obtaining the percentages of profit, next perform a calculation of the allocation of the profit to each of the related parties in the transactions based on the weight of their contributions.\n\n(6) Determine arm's length profit.\n\nThe positive correction to net operating profit is attributed to the affiliated transactions that occurred, such as purchase transactions.\n\n6) Residual Profit Split Method (RPSM)\n\nThe RPSM is applied in cases where both parties in the transactions have unique and highly valuable contributions (for example, contribution of unique/valuable intangible property).\n\nThe steps in applying the Residual Profit Split Method include the following:\n\n(1) Combine the net operating profit of the related parties as a single unit.\n\n(2) Determine the contribution of each party.\n\nBased on the FAR analysis, it is known that TMD Corp. has manufacturing intangibles in the form of patent, while TMDI has marketing intangibles.\n\n(3) Identify the routine functions (simple functions) without the contribution of each party.\n\nTMD Corp. has a routine manufacturing function, while TMDI has a routine function as distributor.\n\n(4) Seek comparables for the routine functions without the unique contributions.\n\nBased on the routine functions performed by each party, it is possible to determine comparables for these routine functions. The routine function of TMD is manufacturing, so the Revenue Officers need to seek comparable companies that routinely engage in manufacturing. For PT TMDI, the Revenue Officers need to seek comparable companies that function routinely as distributors.\n\n(5) Calculate share of profit for each party without the unique contributions.\n\nAfter obtaining external comparables for the routine functions of each party, the next step is to allocate the profit based on routine compensation using the one-sided method.\n\n(6) Determine the Relative Values of the unique contributions of each party.\n\nThe residual profit (that is, the remaining profit after step five (5)) is attributed to the affiliated parties based on the relative values of the unique contributions made by each party.\n\nThe following approaches can serve as a basis in determining the relative values of the unique contributions of the related parties:\n\n(a) external market benchmark that reflects the fair market value of intangible property;\n\n(b) capitalized costs for development, repair, and renovation of intangible property, less the appropriate amount of amortization based on the useful life of each intangible property; or\n\n(c) actual amount of cost of development of intangible property in the most recent years, if this expense is constant during that period and the useful life of the intangible property of the parties involved does not differ too greatly.\n\n(7) Allocate the Residual Profit based on the relative values of the unique contributions of each party. After obtaining the relative values of the unique contributions of each party, the next step is to allocate the residual profit based on the relative values of the unique contributions of each party.\n\n(8) Determine arm's length profit from the result of the calculations up to step seven (7) above.\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nBusiness Restructuring\n\nBusiness restructuring within a multinational group often results in a change of business characterization and reduction of profitability of a local entity. Such reduction of profits is acceptable only with reduced functions performed, assets employed and risk assumed. As long as these FAR are actually transferred, it is viewed as commercially rational for a multinational group to restructure in order to obtain tax savings. However, if it is found that the local entity continues to perform the same functions, and bears the same risks, Revenue Officers will make necessary adjustments. In an arm's length situation, an independent party would not restructure its business if it results negatively for it, where it has option realistically available not to do so.\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nIntra-Group Services\n\nIntra-group services are activities provided by one party within a business group that provide benefits for one or more other members in the business group. Intra-group services may take the form of management services, administration services, technical services, support services, purchasing services, marketing services, distribution services, and other commercial services provided in connection with the nature of the group's business.\n\nBasically, the existence of transactions of delivery of intra-group services is recognized if the service provides economic benefit or commercial value that improves the commercial position of the company receiving the services (for example, increases profit or adds efficiency by reducing operating costs). This can be determined by considering whether an independent party in comparable conditions would be willing to pay an independent party or would perform the provision of the services itself (in-house).\n\nSteps in Applying the Arm's Length Principle to Intra-Group Services:\n\n1) Ensure that a certain service from a related party has in fact been performed and provided economic benefit to the other related party which can be tested by the Revenue Officer as follows:\n\na) To confirm the existence or realization of the service provided, the Revenue Officers need to consider the following:\n\n\u2022 Examine the process of the background for the need to the service and the related documents.\n\n\u2022 Examine the process of appointment of the service provider, including by examining the qualifications of the service provider (for example, as indicated by a curriculum vitae containing word experience, educational background, and the track record of the service provider).\n\n\u2022 Examine the process of negotiation regarding the compensation for the service that is provided.\n\n\u2022 Examine the process and results of the provision of the service as well as the related documents/evidence.\n\n\u2022 Examine whether the actual service is rendered as defined under the service agreement.\n\n\u2022 Review documents relating to the service activities, such as contract agreements and invoices.\n\n\u2022 Examine the parties involved in implementation of provision of the service (provision of services may be done by the related party itself or with the involvement of the taxpayer and third parties).\n\nb) To ensure that the service provided has an economic benefit, the Revenue Officers need to consider the following:\n\n\u2022 Ensure that the functions performed by the taxpayer are matched with the type of intra-group services received.\n\nExample 18:\n\nBased on the result of the FAR analysis, it is known that PT ASG is a distributor that does not perform activities that add value to the products. Therefore, PT ASG should not be charged a fee for technical services related to manufacturing activities.\n\n\u2022 Examine the details of the services charged (if more than one) and understand specifically how these services could provide or have provided economic benefit to the taxpayer.\n\n\u2022 The following type of activities are not considered as intra-group services:\n\n(1) Shareholder activity\n\nShareholder activity is services intended for activities of the parent company.\n\nIn certain conditions, a parent company will charge a service fee to its subsidiary even though the subsidiary does not need the service and would not pay for the service if there were no special relationship. Therefore, the amount charged as service fee is not allowed as a deduction.\n\nExample 19:\n\n(a) Activities for the reporting needs of the parent company, for instance, preparation of consolidated financial statements.\n\n(b) Activities related to the legal status and structure of the parent company, such as overseeing compliance of annual reports, holding shareholder meetings, issuing shares and managed by the oversight board.\n\n(c) Collecting funds to be used by the parent company itself in order to acquire another business/branch.\n\n(2) Duplicative services\n\nDuplicative services are services performed by a member of a multinational corporation group that duplicate activities performed by the taxpayer itself or performed by a third party.\n\nIn evaluating the duplication of services, it is necessary to examine the taxpayer's ability to provide the service by itself (for example in terms of qualifications, expertise, and availability of personnel) or if the taxpayer has paid an independent party to provide the service. If a fee is charged for a duplicative service, this intra-group service cannot be charged.\n\nExample 20:\n\nPT TMD has performed its own analysis of its operating capital and budget, but in the same year the parent company also charges PT TMD a fee for the same service of analysis of operating capital and budget.\n\nAn exception may apply if the duplication of services is only special and temporary.\n\n(3) Services that provide incidental benefit\n\nA service that provides incidental benefit is an activity performed by one member of a business group for certain members that also provides incidental benefit to the taxpayer in the group. Generally, intra-group services will be performed to meet the needs of a particular beneficiary. Other members of the group may gain benefit incidentally from such services. The cost charged for such incidental benefits that are received is not a cost that can be charged as expense.\n\nExample 21:\n\nIn a group that has a centralized information technology function, company LAC installs a new computerized system to handle orders in company WSR (an affiliate). Company WSR sells its products to third parties and also to company FEL (an affiliated company). The efficiency of company WSR's new system enables company FEL to reduce its overhead costs by reducing the staffing in the purchasing department.\n\nCompany FEL receives an incidental benefit from the service performed by company LAC for company WSR. Even if company LAC is not deemed to be providing service to company FEL, in an arm's length situation company FEL would not want to contribute to the charges for implementing the new system in company WSR, because the activities performed by company LAC aimed at meeting the needs of company WSR.\n\n(4) Passive association\n\nPassive association is a service that is paid to a related company simply because the taxpayer is a member of the company group.\n\nExample 22:\n\nThere is no service fee that must be paid by a taxpayer simply because the taxpayer receives a higher credit rating when it is a part of the company group than when the taxpayer is not a part of the company group.\n\n(5) On-call services\n\nOn-call services are services provided by one member of a business group (usually the parent company) that are always available at any time when needed by the taxpayer, or if provided by an independent party, there would be a special charge for such service to ensure its availability.\n\nAn on-call service may not be charged if:\n\n\u2022 the potential for use of the service is very low,\n\n\u2022 the benefit obtained from the service is insignificant (negligible), or\n\n\u2022 the on-call service could be obtained immediately at any time and are available from another, independent party without first having to enter into an on-call service agreement.\n\nIn analyzing the potential use and benefits of on-call services that are provided, the Revenue Officers may consider the use of said services in the year concerned and previous years.\n\n2) Perform calculation of the arm's length payment for the intra-group services.\n\nThe steps that need to be taken to calculate the arm's length nature of payments for services are as follows:\n\na) Review basis for charging fees for intra-group services.\n\nThe charging of fees for intra-group services should be based on the costs actually expended in providing the services. For example, a charge for management services should be based on the amount of cost actually spent, not based on the taxpayer's turnover. In order to know the basis for payment of intra-group service fees, the Revenue Officers have to:\n\n\u2022 Look at the agreement documents for the intra-group services, and/or\n\n\u2022 Conduct interviews with key personnel.\n\nb) Examine the components in the cost base actually expended by the service provider and their appropriateness to the service provided and the economic benefits for the taxpayer.\n\nExample 23:\n\nASG Co. charges accounting services to PT TMD with the details of the cost base as follows: salary of accounting expert sent to Indonesia, bonus for director of ASG Co., round-trip Indonesia-X air ticket, and cost of holiday in Bali. In this case, ASG Co. cannot include the bonus for director of ASG Co. and the cost of holiday in Bali as components in the cost base of the accounting services charged to PT TMD.\n\nc) Examine the method for charging for the services used.\n\nMethods for charging for services consist of the direct charges method and the indirect charges method.\n\n(1) Direct Charges Method\n\n(a) The direct charges method is used in the situation where the service, the recipient of the service, the fee that is charged, and the basis for the charge can all be clearly identified. The charge can be allocated directly to the recipient.\n\n(b) The direct charges method should be applied by a service provider company when similar services are provided not only to related parties but also to unrelated parties.\n\n(2) Indirect Charges Method\n\nThe indirect charges method is used when the direct charges method cannot be applied or when the charge relating to the services provided is not easy to identify and attribute to the related company.\n\nExample 24:\n\nProvision of information technology services such as an information management system that involves development, application and maintenance of electronic data for several members of a company group.\n\nThe indirect charges method is based on allocation of charges and the allocation that refers to the basis of the allocation (key allocation) in accordance with the nature and purpose of the services provided. For example, provision of payroll services may be associated more with the number of personnel than with turnover, while the allocation for use of network infrastructure may be allocated in accordance with the number of computers.\n\nd) Examine the basis for allocation of charges for services.\n\nApplication of the arm's length principle to intra-group service transactions requires that the amount of expense allocated to the group members is commensurate with the benefit expected from the services. The Revenue Officers are expected to document the analysis performed to select the basis of the allocation (key allocation). The basis of the allocation of charges for services should be adjusted to the nature and purpose of the services provided.\n\nAllocation based on sales is acceptable if the taxpayer can explain the correlation between sales and the cost that is expended.\n\ne) Examine whether there are comparables for the intra-group services and their mark-up and apply the transfer pricing method that is most appropriate to the conditions and facts.\n\nThe methods that may be used in evaluating the arm's length nature of services fees include:\n\n(1) Comparable Uncontrolled Price Method;\n\n(2) Cost Plus Method; and\n\n(3) Transactional Net Margin Method.\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nIntangible Asset Transactions\n\nIntangible assets, for the purpose of transfer pricing analysis, are assets that are neither physical assets nor financial assets. Intangible assets are divided into two (2) major categories, comprising Manufacturing Intangibles and Marketing Intangibles.\n\nSteps of testing in connection with Intangible Asset Transactions:\n\n1) Identify the existence of every intangible asset that makes a contribution to the success of the product in the market. This identification can be done through FAR analysis. In the FAR analysis, the Revenue Officers are expected to have a good understanding of the taxpayer's business.\n\n2) Identify the value of intangible assets and determine which parties contributed to the formation of the intangible assets. This needs to be done so that it will be known whether the taxpayer in the Philippines contributed to the formation and is therefore entitled to enjoy the proceeds from the exploitation of the intangible assets.\n\n3) Study whether there has been a transfer of intangible assets in the transaction. Analysis of the time of occurrence of transfer of intangible assets in independent transactions can serve as a guide.\n\n4) Determine the arm's length compensation for each intangible asset that is transferred.\n\nThis is done by referring to the market where the intangible assets are used and comparing it with comparable transactions.\n\nTesting of the arm's length nature for utilization or transfer of intangible assets must consider the perspectives of the party that delivers (transferor) and the party that receives (transferee) the intangible assets. The transferor must ensure that it will obtain greater benefit from the transfer/utilization of the intangible assets than the costs that have been expended. On the transferee's side, the Revenue Officers will look at whether it will receive a greater benefit it uses/obtains the intangible assets than the costs that must be expended.\n\nIn testing the arm's length nature of intangible asset transactions, it is necessary to understand their type and characteristics. This understanding will make it easier to determine the factors that will affect the value of the license for the intangible assets and also to determine the comparable transactions. The factors that are generally used as the basis of consideration in determining the value of licenses for intangible assets include:\n\na) Protection and time frame\n\nCertain kinds of intangible assets, such as patents, are protected by law for a certain period of time. This provided protection from competitors who would otherwise duplicate them. The longer the period of protection of the intangible assets, the greater the benefit that is expected to be received.\n\nb) Exclusiveness\n\nThis relates to whether the utilization of the intangible assets is protected by an exclusive right or not. A party that utilizes intangible assets with exclusive rights should be willing to pay a higher royalty fee than a party that utilizes intangible assets without exclusive rights.\n\nc) Geographical Coverage\n\nThe greater the geographical coverage provided, the greater the benefit is obtained.\n\nd) Useful life of intangible assets\n\nCertain intangible assets have a limited useful life. The useful life is influenced not only by legal protection as mentioned above but also by the level of technological inventions in a particular industry. Heavy competition in certain industries causes the useful life of intangible assets that are invented to be shorter.\n\ne) Right to develop, revise, and make improvements\n\nProtection of an intangible asset will be obsolete when new technology is invented. To be able to compete, the party that receives the benefit of the intangible assets may be given the right to take part in developing, revising and making improvements. If this right is granted, this needs to be considered in determining the value of the license of the intangible assets.\n\nf) Existence of other intangible assets or services inherent in the delivery of utilization of the intangible assets. The utilization of certain intangible assets is often accompanied by continuing provision of services by the licensor. This needs to be considered in determining the amount of the royalty that is paid and in selecting comparables.\n\ng) Existence of right to sublicense to third parties.\n\nh) Other factors that could economically influence the value of the license for intangible assets.\n\nIn the case that the taxpayer is the party makes use of (the Licensee) or the purchaser of the intangible assets, attention needs to be given to the following:\n\na) The payment that is made will obtain a rate of return commensurate with the royalty that is paid. This is shown through financial analysis of the transaction.\n\nb) The payment that is made will provide an economic benefit for the use of the intangible assets from the affiliated party.\n\n5) The methods that can be used in evaluating the arm's length nature of transfer of intangible assets include:\n\na) Comparable Uncontrolled Price Method;\n\nb) Resale Price Method;\n\nc) Cost Plus Method;\n\nd) Transactional Net Margin Method;\n\ne) Profit Split Method; and\n\nf) Other methods;\n\n(1) Methods based on cost approach\n\n(2) Methods based on market approach\n\n(3) Methods based on revenue approach\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nCost Contribution Arrangement\n\n1. Concept of Cost Contribution Arrangement (CCA)\n\nCCA is a framework in the form of contractual agreement among companies to share the costs and risks of developing, producing, or obtaining assets, services or rights, and to determine the nature and extent of the interests of each participant in those assets, services or rights. Each participant's proportionate share of the overall expected contributions to the arrangement will be consistent with the participant's proportionate share of the overall expected benefits to be received under the arrangement. The participant would be entitled to exploit its interest in the CCA separately as an effective owner, not as a licensee. Where a taxpayer enters into a CCA separately with its associated party/ies, the arrangement should reflect that of an arm's length arrangement.\n\n2. Types of CCA\n\nThere are two major types of CCA:\n\n1. Arrangement for joint development of intangible property\n\nIn this arrangement each participant contributes different assets, resources and expertise, and receives a share of rights in the developed property based on the contribution.\n\n2. CCA could exist for any joint funding or sharing of costs and risks, for developing or acquiring property or for obtaining services such as pooling resources for the development of advertising campaigns common to the participants' market. However, if a service arrangement does not result in any property being produced, developed or acquired, the principles for dealing with intragroup service will apply to that arrangement whether it is described as CCA or not.\n\nExample 25:\n\nThree members of a multinational group, marketing a product in the same regional market where consumers have similar preferences, want to enter a CCA to develop a joint advertising campaign. A fourth member of the group helps develop the advertising campaign but it does not have any beneficial interest in the services subject to the CCA activity and would not, in any case, have a reasonable expectation of being able to exploit any interest. The three participants in the CCA would, therefore, compensate the fourth member by way of an arm's length payment for the advertising services provided to the CCA.\n\n3. Applying the ALP\n\nTo demonstrate whether a CCA accords with arm's length arrangement in comparable circumstances, the following matters should be addressed:\n\na) CCA should be entered into with prudent and practical business judgment with a reasonable expectation of its benefits. An independent party would not enter a CCA where the value of the contribution exceeds the expected benefits. Estimation of the expected benefit to be derived from the arrangement can be computed in the following manner:\n\ni) Based on the anticipated additional income that will be generated or the expected cost savings; or\n\nii) The use of an appropriate allocation key, perhaps based on sales, units used, produced or sold, gross or operating profits, number of employees, capital invested or alternative keys.\n\nb) Terms of the arrangement should be agreed upon up-front and in accordance with economic substance, judged by reference to circumstances known or reasonably foreseeable at the time of entry into the arrangement.\n\nConsideration for the entry, withdrawal and termination of a CCA should be dealt with at arm's length, as follows:\n\na) Where a participant's contribution is not consistent with its expected share of benefits from the CCA, a balancing payment may be required between the participants to adjust their respective contributions;\n\nb) Where a participant transfers its pre-existing rights of a prior CCA to a new participant, the exiting participant must be compensated based upon an arm's length value for the transferred interest (buy-in payment). The amount of the buy-in payment shall be determined based on the price an independent party would have paid for the rights obtained by the new participant, taking into account the proportionate share of the overall expected benefit to be received from the CCA; and\n\nc) Where a participant disposes of part or all of its interest, he should be compensated with an arm's length payment (buy-out payment).\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nInterest Payment Transactions\n\nAudits of intra-group loan transactions are conducted to test the arm's length nature of the taxpayer's debt to equity ratio and to test the reasonableness of the interest rate and/or other expenses related to the intra-group loan transaction that are charged to the Taxpayer.\n\nThe steps that need to be taken in testing interest payment transactions include the following:\n\n1) Perform analysis of the need for the debt.\n\nTesting of fairness of debt and the amount of the debt to affiliated parties can be done by looking at the following factors:\n\na) Nature and purpose of the debt\n\nThe decision to make a loan must consider the economic conditions and purposes of incurring the debt with an affiliated party. The economic purpose of the loan is known by calculating a working capital analysis of the taxpayer.\n\nb) Market conditions at the time the loan is extended\n\nThe decision to make a loan usually considers market interest rate conditions. When the interest rate is high, the taxpayer should consider more carefully the economic costs and benefits of the debt that is incurred.\n\nc) Amount of loan principal and period of the loan\n\nThe decision to make a loan should consider the amount of funds that is needed by the borrower for the intended economic purposes. In addition, the period for repayment should consider the taxpayer's ability to repay the loan.\n\nd) Security offered by borrower and guarantees in the loan\n\nThe decision to make a loan and the amount of funds that are lent should consider the security of the funds that are provided. The guarantee in a loan may take the form of the taxpayer's assets or a personal guarantee from another party.\n\ne) Amount of debt already held by borrower\n\nThe decision to make a loan should consider the amount of loans already held by the taxpayer. This relates to the taxpayer's ability to settle all its liabilities that arise, including payment of loan principal and interest. The taxpayer's ability to pay the interest expense can be calculated using the usual Interest Coverage Ratio of similar companies.\n\nCalculation of the Interest Coverage Ratio can be done as follows:\n\nInterest Coverage Ratio\n\n=\n\nEarnings before Interest and Taxes (EBIT)\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\n\nInterest Charge\n\n2) Confirm that the loan actually occurred.\n\nTo confirm that the loan actually occurred, the Revenue Officers can perform research on the loan agreement documents and the flow of cash of granting the loan and/or of repayment of the principal and/or interest.\n\n3) Test the arm's length nature of the debt to equity ratio.\n\nThe arm's length nature of the debt to equity ratio can be determined by comparing with the debt and equity of similar companies. If the ratio is unreasonable, adjustments can be made.\n\n4) Test interest rate of loans with affiliated parties.\n\nTesting of the interest rate of loans with affiliated parties is done by comparing the interest rate of the loan with the affiliated party to the interest rate commonly used by independent parties. The interest rates commonly used by independent parties are usually calculated from a particular interest rate (for example BSP, LIBOR, SIBOR, USOR, or JISOR) plus a certain amount based on the credit rating of the party receiving the loan or other aspects.\n\n5.) Determination of arm's length price/profit\n\nAfter reliable comparables have been obtained and the transfer pricing method has been determined, the next step is to compare the price of profit of the affiliated transactions with the price or profit of the comparables in line with the method that is being used.\n\n6.) Primary adjustments, secondary adjustments, and corresponding adjustments\n\nThe discrepancy between the price or profit of the affiliated transactions and the arm's length price or profit is a primary adjustment. If the primary adjustment is made on the level of profit, the Revenue Officers must attribute the adjustment to profit to affiliated transactions with a high risk of tax avoidance.\n\nThe primary adjustments made by the Revenue Officers may lead to secondary adjustments. A secondary adjustment is a further adjustment that can occur because of the existence of a primary adjustment to the affiliated transactions. For example, the Revenue Officers make a positive adjustment to one of the Taxpayer's affiliated transactions. As a result of this correction, there is an overpayment to an affiliated party. For this overpayment, the Revenue Officers may make a secondary adjustment based on the applicable tax regulations.\n\nFurther, based on primary and secondary adjustments, corresponding adjustments may also be made in accordance with the applicable tax regulations.\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nReport Making\n\nThe Revenue Officers are required to make a report after the audit or investigation has been conducted.\n\nIn addition to the reporting requirements of the existing RAMO, Revenue Officers conducting the transfer pricing audit or investigation are required to comply with all the reporting requirements specifically provided in this Transfer Pricing Audit Guidelines.",

BACKGROUND\n\nInformation Technology (IT) has caused the present pervasive use of Information System tools for taxpayers to conduct their business and has changed rapidly the manner of recording transactions. Indeed, technology is so pervasive that it would be difficult for many taxpayers to meet their accounting and financial reporting objectives without using technology. The changes in the use of information technology by business have had a profound effect on accounting and auditing because these records are almost universally recorded, processed, and reported digitally.\n\nConsequently, changes brought about by information technology have changed the very nature of the evidence of transactions and have created a challenge for the tax auditors to maintain their competence. This is because the change in business process results also in the removal of traditional source of information in which conventional manual audit techniques become inadequate and therefore demands the creation of new audit procedures to conduct the tax compliance audit.\n\nII. OBJECTIVE\n\nThis order is issued to:\n\n1. Supplement the existing Audit Manuals to improve the quality of a tax audit but with avoidance of duplication of work;\n\n2. Prescribe the mandatory use of Computer Assisted Audit Tools and Techniques (CAATTs) for the audit of all taxpayers using different accounting application programs, computerized accounting records and components thereof; aDIHCT\n\n3. Provide revenue officers with minimum standard procedures and techniques for data analysis, calculation, reconciliation, exception testing, etc., using applicable commands/CAATTs application available in an audit software as provided under the Computer Audit Manual, hereto attached as Annex \"A\";\n\n4. Reduce audit cycle in order to provide for timely reports of investigation and to focus on critical aspects of taxpayers' financial operations; and\n\n5. Simplify audit documentation.\n\nIII. POLICY\n\nTo ensure quality audit of tax returns of taxpayers using Computerized Accounting System (CAS) or any components thereof, revenue officers shall utilize their technical skill, training, and experience in computer assisted audit, and follow the minimum computer assisted audit tools and techniques as prescribed in the Computer Audit Manual.\n\nIV. EFFECTIVITY\n\nThis Order takes effect immediately.\n\n(SGD.) LILIAN B. HEFTI\nCommissioner of Internal Revenue",

Overview\n\nThe emergence of various technologies in data processing has changed the way a tax audit or examination can be efficiently and effectively done by a Revenue Officer (RO). Ignoring the computer, treating it as a black box, and auditing around it is no longer feasible given the continuous advancement in technologies used by the taxpayers. While there is no doubt that the use of computers has improved exponentially the reliability of processing financial transactions and integrity of financial data, the Bureau realizes that there are significant changes that impact on the traditional audit procedures Performed by the Revenue Officers. EAISDH\n\nThe challenges faced by the RO in the use of computer technology are in the following:\n\n1. Retrieval of data in electronic form;\n\n2. Interpretation of electronic data;\n\n3. Identification of audit trail;\n\n4. Storage of the data in electronic media; and\n\n5. Application system deficiencies/unauthorized changes and other forms of technical manipulations.\n\nIt is in this context that this Manual is prepared \u2014 to enable the ROs to address these major challenges brought about by the widespread use of computer application systems by taxpayers.\n\nThe Computer Audit Manual is the supplemental reference of the ROs in the investigation of the internal revenue tax liabilities of the taxpayers who use a Computerized Accounting System (CAS) or components thereof.\n\nII. Objectives and Scope\n\nThis Manual is intended to:\n\n1. Supplement the existing Audit Manuals but with avoidance of duplication of work;\n\n2. Prescribe the mandatory use of Computer Assisted Audit Tools and Techniques (CAATTs) for the audit of all taxpayers using different accounting application programs, computerized accounting records and components thereof;\n\n3. Provide ROs with minimum standard procedures and techniques for data analysis, calculation, reconciliation, exception testing, etc.;\n\n4. Reduce audit cycle; and\n\n5. Simplify audit documentation.\n\nThis Manual covers the following areas:\n\n1. Definition of technical terms EHSTDA\n\n2. Preliminary audit work\n\n3. Examination proper\n\n4. Documentation and reports\n\n5. Review of audit reports\n\nIII. Definition of Technical Terms\nASCII \u2014 refers to data that has been encoded according to the American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII). It is the native character set of most minicomputers and all personal computers.\n\nAudit Software (AS) \u2014 software designed for data extraction and analysis of accounting transaction files.\n\nAudit Command Language (ACL) \u2014 a commercial audit software used as an audit tool for analyzing large data files quickly, easily and accurately.\n\nCD-ROM (Compact Disc-Read Only Memory) \u2014 is a data reader for optical discs commonly called CD drive.\n\nCD-R (Compact Disc-Read Only) \u2014 a variation of the Compact Disc which is a Write Once, Read Many (WORM) optical media (though the whole disc does not have to be entirely written in the same session) and retains a high level of compatibility with standard CD readers. These optical discs are read-only which cannot be modified, deleted or written over with new data.\n\nConversion \u2014 transforming data files of a taxpayer from its native format to a preferred format readable by an audit software (e.g. delimited text files, dbf, mdb, excel spreadsheet)\n\nComponent \u2014 is something that forms part of a whole system (e.g. Purchase module, Cash Disbursements module, etc.).\n\nData \u2014 letters, numbers or symbols representing information suitable for processing, communicating or interpreting. A computerized data is stored in files, which are composed of records. Records are composed of fields.\n\nData Dictionary \u2014 a reference containing information about the name, source, purpose and a narrative explanation of each data element in the system; a table in a database that stores the names, field types, length, and other characteristics of the fields in the database tables. An active data dictionary is automatically updated as changes occur in the database. The data dictionary may maintain information on system hardware, software documentation, users, and other aspects. ESAHca\n\nData Type \u2014 defines the type of data stored in a field such as character, numeric or date.\n\n.dbf (database format) \u2014 dBASE's underlying file format that is widely used in many other applications needing a simple format to store structured data.\n\nDisc/Disk \u2014 a round plate or platter on which data can be encoded; a secondary data storage medium which is either a magnetic disk (diskette or hard disk) or an optical disk.

Preliminary Audit Work\n\nA. Pre-Audit Analysis\n\nPrior to examining the taxpayer's books of accounts through the use of CAATTs, analyzing the return is essential to identify potential issues and items for clarification with the taxpayer. The RO needs to familiarize and understand the taxpayer's business operations and accounting processes in connection with CAS or components thereof. The RO also needs to gain an understanding of the used accounting system initially based on documentation included in CSET dockets compiled during the processing and issuance of permits to adopt the CAS or components thereof.\n\nB. Work Planning\n\nThis stage includes the preparation of an audit plan. (Refer to Appendix 1 for a sample audit plan.) The audit plan shall include the audit objectives, audit procedures to be undertaken and the timeframe for the audit. In preparing for the application of CAATTs in the tax examination, the RO shall do the following tasks:\n\na. Understand the taxpayer's Computerized Accounting System (CAS) or components thereof.\n\nb. Identify the type of tax liabilities of the taxpayer.\n\nc. Obtain the relevant documents and reports from CSET relative to the issuance of permit to use CAS, or components thereof, to:\n\ni. Understand the interfaces between application systems where the identified significant transactions are being processed;\n\nii. Understand the formula for programmed computations;\n\niii. Assess whether these formulas are in accordance with the tax laws and regulations; acITSD\n\niv. Identify the relevant data needed by the system in performing such computations;\n\nv. Identify the table/files where such relevant data are located; and\n\nvi. Understand the retention policy of the taxpayer in order to assess the availability and recoverability of historical data needed.\n\nd. Examine the annual affidavit submitted by the taxpayer after each year-end to demonstrate that backup files are being tested for readability and completeness, and can be made available to the Bureau for examination anytime.\n\nAlthough the CAATTs application may vary on a case to case basis, this Manual provides a list of potential CAATs applications that a RO should follow/execute (Appendix 5 and discussion under \"V. Examination Proper\"). These CAATTs applications will now be the basis of the RO in the preparation of a checklist of files/data to be requested from the taxpayer which shall be attached to the Letter of Authority (LA) to be served. (Refer to Appendix 2 for the sample letter request for data and Appendix 3 for checklist of files to be requested from the taxpayer depending on industry type.)\n\nC. Contact with the Taxpayer\n\nWithin three (3) days after approval and signing of the Letter of Authority (LA)/Audit Notice (AN) by the authorized revenue official, the LA/AN shall be served to the taxpayer, including the list of requirements (Appendix 3) and Survey Sheet* (Appendix 4) for their accomplishment. The RO may request for a systems overview discussion with the taxpayer's Information Technology (IT) personnel. After the overview, the RO shall:\n\n1. Update information on the CAS or components thereof;\n\n2. Identify unreported significant changes to CAS or components thereof and other pertinent data that will be useful in assessing the feasibility of the CAATTs applications;\n\n3. Document unreported changes in the CAS or components thereof to update the CSET documentation and note the violations committed; and\n\n4. Confirm the contents of the files to be requested, expected file size, date of submission, and other related information needed. aSCDcH\n\n* The survey sheet shall also serve as a guide for the RO during discussion to the taxpayer's authorized IT personnel.\n\nD. Developing CAATTs Application\n\nPrior to discussion with the taxpayer, the RO has already listed CAATTs' applications to be used. However, with the information obtained during the discussion or meeting with the taxpayer, the RO shall determine their applicability. At this point, the RO shall:\n\na. Prepare preliminary CAATTs Design; and\n\nb. Draft a high-level CAATTs flowchart depicting the input files, the major processing steps, and the expected output files/reports. A narrative description of the key steps to be performed during the execution phase may be prepared. This will and in building commands and finally executing them.\n\nE. Acquiring the Data (Initial and additional request)\n\nThe following steps shall be undertaken by the RO in relation to acquisition of data:\n\n1. Ascertain the completeness of the following data as requested from the taxpayer:\n\na. Data files;\n\nb. File layout;\n\nc. Table of valid codes (if necessary);\n\nd. Control totals (record count and amount totals); and\n\ne. Reports against which control totals may be reconciled.\n\n2. Ensure that files received from the taxpayer conform to the following preferred file formats (Appendix 7):\n\na. DBF files;\n\nb. Delimited text files; and\n\nc. Flat text files. TcDHSI\n\n3. Perform data file conversion using available software, if necessary (such as ACL, Sesam, Word, Excel, Access, etc.)\n\nF. Verify Data Integrity\n\nThe RO shall:\n\n1. Reconcile control totals with report totals to clear any discrepancies between these amounts.\n\n2. Count the number of records to ensure that the files received are complete and accurate.\n\n3. Check and ensure that no unusual items exist. Unusual items may include the following:\n\na. Duplicates;\n\nb. Gaps;\n\nc. Transactions with negative amounts;\n\nd. Transactions with invalid codes; and\n\ne. Transactions outside the period under examination.\n\n4. Clarify with the taxpayer the existence of unusual transactions. Depending on the justification of the taxpayer, the RO may opt to isolate these transactions as they may require different parameters and conditions from those of regular items, or he may automatically treat them as invalid items, hence considered exceptions.\n\n5. Upon establishing the completeness and accuracy of data files and clarifying unusual items, analyze further the data files.\n\n6. Request for another download of the files, in case the files received do not meet the data integrity test. The discrepancies may be caused by errors on downloading or conversion form one format to another.\n\nV. Examination Proper\nGeneral Procedures\n\nIn addition and/or in lieu of the traditional procedures performed during tax examinations, the RO shall execute the following minimum CAATTs' application/s to carry out the audit plan: ETIDaH\n\nA. Determine differences during the test run if these are due to faulty program logic in the CAATTs application or due to taxpayer's system error. If the discrepancy is caused by faulty program logic, abnormal input data not considered in the computation, or incorrect record layout, modify and rerun the application as deemed necessary until such time that the CAATTs application proves to be responsive of the CAATTs objectives and tested to provide accurate results. Test run may be applied in any of the following:\n\n1. The whole data file, if there is only one file provided;\n\n2. One of many files provided, e.g., 1st month in a group of monthly files; and\n\n3. A subset of the data file, it the whole file is very large.\n\nB. Execute the applicable CAATTs' application (Note: Always keep track totals of record count and amounts to ensure that the data is processed completely; and Document each CAATTs procedure while executing CAATTs, especially in repeated tests.)\n\n1. General Ledger\n\na. Obtain the transaction files that interface with the general ledger which should contain balances of each account together with transaction history, various references and descriptions.\n\nb. Understand and analyze coding structures of more complex general ledgers which have segmented account code for different purposes. Transaction data should include sources, dates, accounting month, transaction references and posting reference. Sophisticated ledgers will hold each individual posting to allow inquiries, analyses and \"drill down\".\n\nc. Generate ledger balances\n\ni. Summarize totals of entries generated by different sources/modules (e.g., purchase or sales ledger, journal vouchers, etc.);\n\nii. Foot (total) the balances to ensure they balance to zero. Note: some ledgers include memo amounts which may need to be excluded; and\n\niii. Total (or summarize) transactions by account. HITAEC\n\nd. Perform Exception Tests:\n\ni. Test for transactions with dates outside the taxable period under audit;\n\nii. Analyze per account and look for unusual debit/credit entries and consequent tax exposure; and\n\niii. Test for duplicate postings.\n\ne. Match and Compare generated account groupings against balances per audited financial statements. Document unreconciled discrepancies, if any\n\nNOTE: Some General Ledgers hold non-financial data, e.g., employee numbers, for use in management reporting and apportioning of costs. There will be some form of type code to identify these and they should be excluded from the computation of the trial balance.\n\n2. Sales\n\nGenerally a sales history file should be available, although on some systems, transactions are archived monthly. In this case, arrangement/s will have to be made to copy and save the file each month. The Append Databases feature of the Audit Software can then be used to create an annual file (or whatever period is required) from the monthly files. It is worthwhile conducting some analyses of sales by appropriate headings and then using exception testing.\n\na. Analyze\n\ni. Analyze sales by month, category or customer (for VAT or percentage tax analysis); and\n\nii. Analyze open orders and open invoices by customer.\n\nb. Generate ledger balances of sales transactions\n\ni. Reproduce sales summaries and posted totals;\n\nii. Test pricing and discount computations on invoices; and\n\niii. Relate between items shipped and items booked as sales. EHACcT\n\nc. Perform Exception Tests\n\ni. Extract all sales data for audit by customer, product, region, etc., and generate exceptions pertaining to sales prices less than expected for product type or large discount given (transfer pricing and large credit notes).\n\nd. Look for Gaps and Duplicates\n\ni. Test for missing sales invoice numbers;\n\nii. Test for missing shipping/delivery receipts; and\n\niii. Test for duplicate invoices (either duplicate invoice number, shipping order number or customer and detail/amount).\n\ne. Match and Compare\n\ni. Match cash receipts to receipts posted to the Accounts Receivable ledger for credit transactions. Identify any unmatched records.\n\n3. Inventory\n\nInventory can vary in volume and cost within organizations. Where inventory is a significant item, audit testing is used to provide assurance on existence, completeness (cut-off) and valuation.\n\na. Analyze and Summarize\n\ni. Analyze high value transactions (e.g., input tax verification);\n\nii. Summarize stock on-hand by group, location, type, etc.; and\n\niii. Summarize products by group, location, type, etc.\n\nb. Generate Ledger balances relative to Inventor\n\ni. Generate report on products in order of profitability; and\n\nii. Test clerical accuracy of totals and extensions.\n\nc. Perform Exception Tests SDTIaE\n\ni. Identify stock acquired from associated companies; and\n\nii. Isolate inventory items with cost greater than retail price, with zero/negative quantities, or with zero/negative prices.\n\nd. Look for Gaps and Duplicates\n\ni. Test for duplicate item numbers or descriptions.\n\ne. Match and Compare\n\ni. Compare cost to selling price to look for valuation discrepancies.\n\n4. Payroll\n\nPayroll auditing is an excellent application of the Audit Software. The main objective is to check validity and accuracy by testing existence of employee, correctness of pay and accuracy of withholding taxes made. There are many regulations and taxes associated with payroll and compliance therewith can be checked. Privacy concerns/confidentiality may limit verification but the following common tests may be applied:\n\na. Analyze and Summarize\n\ni. Analyze and summarize costs for special pay, overtime, premiums, etc.; and\n\nii. Summarize payroll distribution for reconciliation to general ledger.\n\nb. Generate ledger balances of Payroll-related accounts\n\ni. Total gross pay, net pay, deductions and any other value fields;\n\nii. Check computation of gross pay;\n\niii. Check computation of taxable/non taxable pay;\n\niv. Classify employee by position;\n\nv. Classify and summarize employees' pay by cost center and compare against MCIT;\n\nvi. Recompute withholding taxes and compare against remittances; and DacASC\n\nvii. Compare payroll master file with payroll list or Alpha List.\n\nc. Perform Exception Tests\n\ni. Extract all employees not included in the employee masterfile; and\n\nii. Extract all employees with missing Tax Identification Number (TIN).\n\nd. Look for Gaps and Duplicates\n\ni. Duplicate employees' TIN on payroll file; and\n\nii. Duplicate names.\n\n5. Fixed Assets\n\nFixed Asset registers vary in the detail of information and volume of records. In organizations with significant volumes of plant and machinery, the Audit Software can be used to scan for problem items.\n\na. Analyze\n\ni. Provide a total of fully depreciated assets still in use.\n\nb. Generate ledger balances on Fixed Assets related accounts\n\ni. Segregate the file providing the total cost, depreciation and net book values and net recoverable value;\n\nii. Recalculate depreciation figures;\n\niii. Prove totals of additions and disposals and recalculate profits or losses on disposal; and\n\niv. Segregate impairment losses.\n\nc. Perform Exception Tests\n\ni.

Test for dates in the appropriate period;\n\niv. Identify assets transferred or acquired from group companies;\n\nv. Identify items with zero or negative cost and items where depreciation exceeds cost;\n\nvi. Identify items where description does not match coding;\n\nvii. Extract assets with useful lives or depreciation rates beyond set norms;\n\nviii. Identify fully depreciated items and assets higher than replacement costs;\n\nix. Analyze changes in capital asset accounts and verify existence of any sale, exchange or disposition of fixed or capital assets during the year under audit; and\n\nx Determine assets held for rent or lease to tenants, and extract the amount of rental income received on these properties.\n\nd. Look for Duplicates\n\ni. Test for duplicate reference numbers.\n\ne. March and Compare\n\ni. Compare book and tax depreciation and indicate variances; and\n\nii. Compare useful lives of assets by category.\n\n6. Accounts Receivable (AR)\n\nTests of Accounts Receivable are performed to establish existence, completeness and valuation. Items of particular concern are old unpaid invoices, unmatched cash and large balances. These can all be picked up with exception tests.\n\na. Analyze and Summarize\n\ni. Profile accounts using stratification to identify large accounts and the proportion of value in the larger items; and TCacIE\n\nii. Generate summaries by customer, invoice, amounts, products, etc.\n\nb. Generate ledger balances of AR-related accounts\n\ni. Total the file. Separate debits and credits;\n\nii. Check transaction totals to the balance on each account; and\n\niii. Show variances between delivery documents and invoices.\n\nc. Perform Exception Tests\n\ni. Report credit balances;\n\nii. Identify unmatched cash or credits;\n\niii. Test for items with shipping dates or numbers outside the expected range;\n\niv. Identify part payments of accounts or invoices;\n\nv. Identify invalid transaction types; and\n\nvi. Identify high value credit notes, balances, and invoices.\n\nd. Look for Gaps and Duplicates\n\ni. Identify for duplicate invoices, credit notes or receipts; and\n\nii. Report gaps in sequences of invoices and credit notes generated\n\n7. Accounts Payable (AP)\n\nIt is important to establish that liabilities are neither understated nor overstated. Current standards also look for potential fraudulent activities in the accounting systems.\n\nMany accounts payable tests also relate to supplier master file details. This often resides on a different file of the detailed ledger items. Apply the common tests as follows: HCaEAT\n\na. Analyze and Summarize\n\ni. Reconcile check register to disbursements by vendor invoice; and\n\nii. Summarize invoices by supplier to prove individual balances.\n\nb. Generate ledger balances of AP-related accounts\n\ni. Total the file. Separate debit and credit balances.\n\nc. Perform Exception Tests\n\ni. Identify debit balances;\n\nii. Identify unusual stand-out data; and\n\niii. Identify and total liabilities for goods received and not yet invoiced.\n\nd. Look for Gaps and Duplicates\n\ni. Test for duplicate payments/invoices.\n\ne. Match and Compare\n\ni. Match subsequent period payments against period and balances to identify unmatched payments;\n\nii. Compare invoices posted against purchase order amounts; and\n\niii. Compare recurring monthly expenses to paid invoices.\n\nMoreover, despite the above enumerations, the RO is not precluded from applying other techniques which are deemed necessary in a particular case.\n\nC. Generate a report on the items with discrepancies (audit findings). Investigate and resolve the issues with the taxpayer. For example, the RO may obtain copies of supporting documents (e.g., sales invoices, official receipts, delivery receipt, sales reports, collection reports, etc.) relating to the exceptions.\n\nAdditional Procedures for Selected Industries\n\nAfter conducting the minimum general procedures discussed in the preceding paragraphs, the RO is mandated to execute necessary CAATTs' application relevant to the taxpayer's industry. Please refer to Appendix 5 for this. DISaEA\n\nVI. Documentation and Reports\n\nDocumentation exists in every phase of an audit cycle, from preliminary works to the examination proper, since one of the best practices in audit is \"documenting while working\". However, in this stage, the documentation and summarization that need to be done pertains to the results of the CAATTs application that will either form part of the audit report, or as supporting papers to the audit report.\n\nThe documents prepared should be collated and retained in a manner that will be understood by other ROs who are not part of the original examination, other authorities within the Bureau, and third parties who might challenge the results of the tax audit. In a computer audit, the analysis conducted by the RO is in electronic form (stored in CD-R or DVD-R or any optical media), and the tests are documented through a \"log file\", which can only be seen when an authorized third party interested to view the audit case looks into it. Since the CD-R should form part of the audit docket, the RO must affix his signature on the \"label\" side of the CD-R. The standard contents of the CD-R to be prepared by the RO are the following:\n\n\u2022 Working Paper (includes analysis of data)\n\n\u2022 Planning Memo (containing CAATTs objectives, scope and output)\n\n\u2022 List of CAATTs objectives and CAATTs application\n\n\u2022 Computation of findings\n\n\u2022 Commands used to generate findings\n\n\u2022 List of Identified Critical Files and Fields Necessary for CAATTs\n\n\u2022 CAATTs System Flowchart\n\n\u2022 Reconciliation/Validation Report of Files Obtained (includes control totals)\n\nTo view the contents even without opening the CD-R, a printed copy of the \"Table of Contents\" of data stored on it, shall form part of the case docket.\n\nROs are required to make a report after the computer assisted audit has been conducted. The documenting and summarizing done will aid the RO in making a good audit report. To make a good audit report, it should contain the reporting requirements prescribed under existing revenue issuances and audit manuals, provided, these will not duplicate the herein prescribed contents of the working paper in CD-R, (i.e. if the existing revenue issuances or audit manuals require the schedules of sales and purchases, and these schedules are already in the Working Paper in electronic form, there is no need to attach schedules in hard copies). acHTIC\n\nHereunder is the list of the basic documents that need to be attached to the case docket containing the audit report, numbered in order of appearance (Item No. 1, being the first document at the bottom of the case docket):\n\n1. Copy of the Letter of Authority/Audit Notice issued;\n\n2. Copy of the Letter-request for data, including the checklist of required documents/files and the duly-accomplished Survey Sheet;\n\n3. Duly Validated Tax Returns/Declarations;\n\n4. Proof of Tax payment, including Tax Debit Memo/Tax Credit Certificates;\n\n5. Agreement Form (for agreed assessments);\n\n6. Notice for an Informal Conference/Post Reporting Notice with summary of findings (for non-agreed assessment);\n\n7. Comparative Report of Deficiency Tax Paid/Assessed, if applicable;\n\n8. BIR Form 0500 Series (Audit Reports);\n\n9. Narrative Memorandum Report;\n\n10. Table of Contents;\n\n11. Docket Locator Form;\n\n12. RO's Activity Report/Log Sheet;\n\n13. CD-R prepared lay the RO (with table of contents in printed copy); and\n\n14. Source Data in CD submitted by the taxpayer, with his signature.\n\nAs prescribed under RR No. 16-2006, the ROs should keep source data and output files in CD until the report of investigation and the tax docket of the case has been reviewed and approved by the authorized Revenue Official. The ROs shall then return to the taxpayer their computerized accounting books/records intact and in their original form upon such termination, otherwise, the source data as well as the back-up electronic accounting documents and records should be retained. (e.g., litigation reference).\n\nVII. Review of Audit Report AHcaDC\n\nReviewing an audit report pertaining to tax audit is a mandatory procedure prior to the approval of the audit reports by authorized officers of the Bureau. To review an audit performed using CAATTs, the reviewer must also have knowledge on how the used audit software runs. Listed hereunder are the minimum review procedures that a reviewer shall follow/execute:\n\n1. Identify potential CAATTs application per audit plan and compare these to the CAATTs application done by the auditors;\n\n2. Check if the CAATTs application done by the auditors meet the audit objectives;\n\n3. Examine whether the procedures performed are in accordance with the CAATTs design, to ensure that the procedures are properly executed and appropriate parameters or conditions are applied;\n\n4. Examine the details of the CAATTs flowchart and compare them with command log file;\n\n5. Validate the final results of the CAATTs processing for accuracy;\n\n6. Take note of any deviations in the results of CAATTs applications review the documented reports;\n\n7. Prepare summary of finding for discussion with the auditors; and\n\n8. Affix signature/initial to pertinent work paper documentations.\n\nAPPENDIX 1\n\nSample Audit Plan\n\nTimeframe for audit \u2014 60 days\n\nI. SALES\n\nA. CAATTs Objectives:\n\n1.

Verify whether all claims for losses are covered by unexpired insurance policy and all these claims are filed during the taxable year;\n\n18. Extract paid and unpaid losses. Consider the possibility of reverting such unpaid losses to income account;\n\n19. Analyze date of incident to date claim reported as part of assessing claims incurred but not recorded;\n\n20. Filter high value claims. Check for duplicate claims (same policy number and either same amount or same date of incident); and\n\n21. Determine existence of any claim by the Philippine branch office of a foreign insurance company licensed to do business in the Philippines for allocated home office expenses. Determine the basis of allocation used and the reasonableness of the ratable share charged to the branch office. Check consistency in the application thereof from year to year. Scrutinize the details of allocated home office expenses and ascertain the propriety of charging said expenses to the Philippines branch office. Consider the possibility of disallowing allocation of charges to the account that have no direct or indirect benefit to the Philippine offices.\n\nIV. BANKS AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS\n\nThe use of Audit Software is on most areas of financial institutions including current accounts, personal and corporate lending, treasury functions and investment accounts. The usual guidelines on volume and depth apply. However in some banking systems, the volume of transactions can be too great to download to PC. It may be appropriate to download a segment of the data (e.g. a region) or a selected number of fields.\n\nA. Internal Revenue Tax Liabilities CDHacE\n\n1. Final Withholding Tax on Interest\n\na.

This section does not present a complete guide for conducting a complete fraud investigation and checklists of audit tests only serve as an aide-memoire.\n\nThere are a number of tools to prevent and detect fraud including personnel vetting, independent authorization of transactions and observation of employees. THE AUDIT SOFTWARE does not replace any of these techniques but adds a tool that is particularly useful in the right circumstances.\n\nClearly the relevant information to check must reside on accessible computer files. Generally, the larger the volumes and the more detailed the information held, the more useful THE AUDIT SOFTWARE becomes. Using THE AUDIT SOFTWARE on copies of the files can be done without alerting those under suspicion and can build up evidence to prove what has occurred. However, it should be noted that there could be problems in submitting computer records as evidence to a court. Hence, expert advice should be sought if information gathered through THE AUDIT SOFTWARE needs to be submitted. Further, this guide does not cover procedures on how to deal with fraudsters for which specialist help should be sought.\n\nMost common areas of fraud are:\n\nI. Sales\n\nII. Payroll\n\nIII.

INTRODUCTION\n\nA Revenue Tax Administration\n\nThe function of the Bureau of Internal Revenue is to administer the provisions of the National Internal Revenue Code. It is the duty of the Bureau to implement the Tax Code and related laws enacted by Congress in a fair and impartial manner.\n\nThe mission of the Bureau is to enforce internal revenue laws with impartiality, consistency, collect the correct amount of taxes at the least cost to the government and least inconvenience to the taxpayer and serve the public honestly and efficiently in a manner that will elicit the highest level of confidence in the Bureau of Internal Revenue.\n\nInvestigation supports the mission of the Bureau by enhancing a high degree of compliance and encouraging the correct reporting of income, transfer, business and other taxes. This is accomplished by:\n\n1. Measuring the degree of voluntary compliance as reflected on filed returns;\n\n2. Reducing non-compliance by identifying returns and taxpayers that need to be investigated; and\n\n3. Conducting quality audit of selected tax returns on a timely basis.\n\nThe purpose of auditing a tax return is to determine the taxpayer's correct tax liability. A quality audit is the examination of a taxpayer's books and records in sufficient depth so as to ascertain the correctness and validity of entries thereon and- the propriety of application of tax laws. ADaSEH\n\nB. Purpose\n\nThe updated Handbook on Audit Procedures and Techniques has been prepared to equip all Revenue Officers who conduct field examinations with-the necessary knowledge for the proper examination of tax returns and provide them with confidence in carrying out the investigation. This Handbook is designed to ensure that. the Revenue Officer acquires useful auditing skills, progresses from simple audit techniques to more sophisticated procedures, and advances in examination procedures from a single proprietorship to a large corporation and from a simple bookkeeping system to a highly computerized one.\n\nThe Revenue Officer's job is to familiarize himself with the business activity and/or undertaking of the taxpayers assigned to him for audit, to evaluate the various methods and procedures the taxpayers apply, to be imaginative, observant and inquisitive in his examination, and above all, to use common sense.\n\nC. Contents of the Handbook\n\nThe handbook contains guides, instructions and suggestions in the conduct of audit for various taxpayers. The discussions begin with the analysis of tax returns and financial statements, familiarization with accounting methods, bookkeeping systems, books of accounts and other related records. The audit procedures for balance sheet and income statement accounts are laid out together with investigation techniques for each type of tax. This does not preclude, however, the Revenue Officer from carrying out other audit techniques which are deemed necessary in the circumstances surrounding a particular case.\n\nThe Handbook is neither intended to provide a source of tax law or procedural doctrine nor a substitute reference material of revenue issuances. Each Revenue Officer is presumed to have a working knowledge of the Tax Code, the latest amendments thereon, and an update of existing revenue regulations, revenue rulings, revenue memorandum orders and other issuances.\n\nThe other contents of the handbook include documentary requirements in the investigation process and proper report making.\n\nII. Accounting Methods\n\nThe taxable income of a taxpayer shall be computed in accordance with the method of accounting he regularly employs in keeping his books. However, if the taxpayer does not regularly employ a method of accounting which reasonably shows his correct income, the computation of income shall be made in such manner as in the opinion of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue or his -duly authorized representative that clearly reflects such income.\n\nThe methods of accounting recognized under the Tax Code are:\n\nA. Cash Basis is a method of accounting whereby all items of gross income received during the year shall be accounted for such taxable year and that only expenses actually paid for shall be claimed as deductions during the year. This method of accounting is generally used by taxpayers who do not keep regular books of accounts. Under this method, income is realized upon receipt of cash or its equivalent including those constructively received (such as deposits for the taxpayer's account by customers) but not including gifts or donations. Users of cash basis accounting are mostly individuals engaged in business and practice of profession, professional partnerships and professional service organizations.\n\nB. Accrual Basisis a method of accounting for income in the period it is earned regardless of whether it has been received or not. In the same manner, expenses are accounted for in the period they are incurred and not in the period they are paid. Under this method, net income is being measured by the excess of income earned during the period over the expenses incurred. Expenses not being claimed as deductions by taxpayers in the current year when they are incurred cannot be claimed as deduction from income for the succeeding year. Thus, a taxpayer who is authorized to deduct certain expenses and other allowable deductions for the current year but failed to do so cannot deduct the same for the next year. The accrual basis of accounting is being used by taxpayers whose nature of business uses inventories since this method of accounting will correctly reflect income by matching purchases and expenses against sales. This method is being applied by most medium and large corporations. HETDAa\n\nC. Completion of Contract Basis is an accounting method applicable to contractors in the construction of building, installation of equipment and other fixed assets, or other construction work covering a period in excess of one year.\n\nUnder this method, gross income is to be reported in the taxable year in which the contract is fully completed and accepted by the contractee if the taxpayer elected it as a consistent practice to treat such income, provided that such method clearly reflects the net income. Under this method, all expenditures, are deducted from gross income during the life of the contract which are properly allocated thereto, taking into consideration any materials and supplies charged to the work under the contract but remaining on hand at the time of the completion.\n\nHowever, pursuant to Republic Act No. 8424 which took effect on January 1, 1998, contractors are no longer allowed to adopt this method of reporting their income derived in whole or in part from long-term contracts.\n\nD. Percentage of Completion Basis is a method applicable in the case of a building, installation or construction contract covering a period in excess of one year whereby gross income derived from such contract may be reported upon the basis of percentage of completion. In determining the percentage of completion of a contract, generally one of the following methods is used:\n\n1. The costs incurred under the contract as of the end of the tax year are compared with the estimated total contract costs; or\n\n2. The work performed on the contract as of the end of the tax year is compared with the estimated work to be performed.\n\nIn such case, the return should be accompanied by a certificate of the architect or engineer showing the percentage of completion during the taxable year of the entire work performed under contract. There should be deducted from such gross income all expenditures made during the taxable year on account of the contract, account being taken of the materials and supplies on hand at the beginning and end of the taxable period for use in connection with the work under the contract but not yet so applied.\n\nBeginning January 1, 1998 income from log-term contracts are required to be reported using this method only.\n\nE. Installment Basis is a method considered appropriate when collections extend over relatively long periods of time and there is a strong possibility that full collection will not be made. As customers make installment payments, the seller recognizes the gross profit on sale in proportion to the cash collected.\n\nF. Crop Year Basis is a method applicable only to farmers engaged in the production of crops which take more than a year from the time of planting to the process of gathering and disposal. Expenses paid or incurred are deductible in the year the gross income from the sale of the crops are realized.\n\nIn relation to the foregoing accounting methods, the Tax Code provides for a tax credit system in computing the tax payable by certain taxpayers. While the tax credit system is not an accounting system, it is discussed here for the proper understanding of the computation of taxes due from taxpayers.\n\nThe tax credit system is a method used to account for the creditable taxes deducted by the withholding agents from the income payments to certain payees (as in the case of withholding tax at source pursuant to Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 6-85, as amended by RR 2-98, or the creditable tax added to the sales price (as in the case of value-added tax). The creditable taxes should be clearly identified in the books of the taxpayer, such as:\n\n1. Creditable income tax (asset)\n\n2. VAT input tax (asset)\n\n3. Withholding tax payable-Compensation (liability)\n\n4. Withholding tax payable-Expanded Withholding Tax (EWT) (liability)\n\n5. VAT output tax (liability)\n\nIII. Bookkeeping Systems\n\nBookkeeping may be classified into two systems, namely, (1) the single entry and (2) the double entry.\n\nA. Single Entry System of bookkeeping is basically a type of \"net worth\" method of arriving at net income. It records only the debit or credit of each transaction, or an account with the debtor or creditor and a simple record of cash receipts and disbursements.\n\nWhenever a system of record keeping does not include equal debit and credit to asset, liability, proprietorship, income and expense accounts, it is referred to AA a \"single entry system\". The single entry is often used by comparatively simple ventures such as small retail or commission merchants, professional firms, estates and trusts. In many cases, the only record of income and deductions consists of entries on the stubs of their checkbooks. Some taxpayers maintain an income tax folder in which they place documents to support their income tax deductions.\n\nA single entry system may be merely a chronological record of transactions posted in a notebook or journal.\n\nSometimes, the records consist of a complete set of journals (cash, sales, purchases and general journal) and general ledger providing important accounts.\n\nThe accounting cycle starts with source documents (invoices, bills, paid checks, loan documents, bank deposit slips, and bank statements) proceeding to the cash receipts and cash disbursements journal, working paper summary and ending with the tax return.\n\nReconciliation of the taxpayer's books, working paper summary and records to the return is a very important audit step. In this way, the Revenue Officer will become familiar with the taxpayer's accounting system, policies and control procedures. If the records available are organized, this will lend more credibility to the tax return, but if they are inadequate, then the Revenue Officer should closely scrutinize the information on the income tax return. Therefore, when encountered with the lack of formal books and records, the Revenue Officer must use source documents and other available documents to establish the taxpayer's financial position which shall be compared with the taxpayer's standard of living and business activity for validation. HTSAEa\n\nThe following formulae for reconstruction of income and expenses may be found useful:\n\nB. Double Entry System \u2014 Under this system of bookkeeping, accounting recognizes the two-fold effect of every recorded event, the debit and the credit or the object of the event and the equitable interest in that object. Every recorded event affecting one side must necessarily affect the other side. This can be presented in an equation:\n\nAssets = Liabilities + Capital\n\nThis can be analyzed into its component elements which show that there are two distinct parties that have right in the assets of the business, the creditors and the owners. The rights of the creditors are the claims of such creditors on the assets of the business which are referred to as liabilities and the rights of the owners on the business are referred to as capital.\n\nIn the double entry method, any net increase and net decrease in asset has a corresponding increase and decrease in either liabilities or capital.\n\nAudit of accounting records under this system shall be detailed as presented in the discussions of audit of real and nominal accounts.\n\nIV. Accounting Records\n\nTaxpayers are required by law and regulations to keep and maintain accounting records in sufficient detail to enable them to make a proper return of income. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue is authorized to examine such records or other data which may be relevant in ascertaining the correctness of the tax returns. The books and records kept must be sufficient to establish the amount of the gross income and the deductions, credits and other matters required to be shown in the tax return.\n\nThe primary records commonly used by all. types of businesses, considering the different accounting systems and reporting methods of the business are invoices, vouchers, bills, receipts and other source documents which are also the supporting documents in the selling and buying of merchandise, services and other assets used in the business. For companies which require the use of inventories, the primary records include the detailed inventory list. Other primary records used in financial transactions are the cancelled checks, duplicate deposit slips, bank statements and notes.\n\nThe secondary records, regardless of the accounting method used by the taxpayer, include permanent books of accounts and working papers which summarize and list the individual documents including adjustments, when necessary. These records are properly classified in such a way that the taxpayer will be able to determine the financial status of his business in a given period of time and the profit and loss for the period.\n\nAll records required to be kept by the taxpayers should be preserved by them for proper administration of any internal revenue law.\n\nBelow are the regular accounting records being used by taxpayers:\n\nA. Journal is a book of original entry in which transactions affecting the business of a taxpayer are recorded consecutively day by day as they occur.\n\nJournal consists of the following:\n\n1. Sales Journal. This is a book whereby sales on account are recorded which are supported by sales invoices and which are also the documents that will serve as the basis of recording the transactions in the books of accounts.\n\nCash sales are usually recorded in the cash book although it may be posted in both books representing a debit to cash in the cash book and a credit to sales in the sales book.\n\nEvery entry in the sales journal represents a debit to a customer's account and a credit to sales to be posted in the general ledger.\n\nSales returns and allowances are also recorded in the sales book which represents a debit to Sales Returns and Allowances and a credit to Accounts Receivable to be posted in the general ledger. This would mean a decrease in Sales and eventually a decrease in an asset account.\n\n2. Purchase Journal. This is a book used to record exclusively all transactions involving the purchase or acquisition of merchandise on account.\n\nThe business document that serves as evidence of a purchase transaction is the purchase invoice.\n\nAn entry to record charge purchases is a debit to Purchases and a credit to Accounts Payable to be posted in the general ledger.\n\nPurchase returns and allowances are also recorded in this book and posted in the general ledger representing a debit to Accounts Payable and a credit to Purchase Returns and Allowances which would mean a decrease in the purchases account.\n\nIn certain instances where the volume of business is large and under the Value-Added Tax system, taxpayers maintain subsidiary sales and purchase journals where details of daily sales and purchases are recorded.\n\n3. Cash Book is a book whereby all transactions involving cash such as cash receipts or cash disbursements are recorded.\n\nTypes of this book are the following:\n\n3.1 Cash receipts book \u2014 a book whereby all transactions involving cash receipts of whatever source are recorded. EHSTcC\n\n3.2. Cash disbursements book \u2014 a book whereby all transactions involving cash or check disbursements are recorded.\n\nB Ledger is a book of final entry wherein the classified accounts or items of all transactions entered in the journal are posted. All entries in the journal must be posted to the ledger and shall be classified accordingly so as to show the assets, liabilities, capital and the operating accounts. This will be the basis for the preparation of the balance sheet and the profit and loss statement covering the operation of the business. No entry shall be made in the ledger unless said entry originates from the journal.\n\nThe accounts contained in the general ledger provide the Revenue Officer with insight of the operations of the business. When pertinent, the chart of accounts and subsidiary ledgers, if any, should be requested from the taxpayer. If a private ledger is maintained, it should also be requested.\n\nAs the Revenue Officer goes through the ledger, unusual or non-recurring items should be noted and verified. Most of these items are classified as follows:\n\n1. Unusual in amount \u2014 The Revenue Officer should be alert for month end entries with significant amounts which may affect income and expenses.\n\n2. Unusual by Source \u2014 means the books of accounts from where the entry to the ledger account originates. Hence, expenses or adjustments to income which do not ordinarily originate from the cash journals, sales and purchase books should be investigated. Such adjustments originating from the general journal or journal vouchers should be thoroughly examined as to supporting documents and proper authorization.\n\n3. Unusual by nature \u2014 An entry in a ledger account may be unusual by nature as well as by the account itself. Accounts with abnormal balances such as receivable accounts with credit balances may indicate income which is credited to receivables instead of sales. Unusual accounts such as suspense, other receivables, due to stockholders, and such other unusual liability accounts should be analyzed as there may be some income components lodged in these accounts.\n\nC. Subsidiary Book. In the general ledger, accounts are usually transferred and grouped into certain accounts to a subsidiary book. This general ledger account is called control account. Control accounts in the general ledger contain summarized information that is recorded in detail in a subsidiary book or ledger. It is, therefore, the control account which contains summarized information and the subsidiary ledger contains the same information but in detail.\n\nThus, in order to relieve the general ledger of too many individual accounts, business concerns having numerous accounts with customers and creditors will transfer said accounts to separate ledgers \u2014 one for customers and another for creditors. For example, the control account for the customer's subsidiary book will be called \"Accounts Receivable\", while the control account for the creditor's subsidiary book will be called \"Accounts Payable\".\n\nAll corporations, companies, partnerships or persons required by law to pay internal revenue taxes have the option to keep this kind of book depending on the need of their business, provided that where such books are kept, they shall form part of the accounting records of the taxpayer and shall be subject to the same rules and regulations as to their keeping, translation, production and inspection as are applicable to the journal and the ledger.\n\nD. Computerized Accounting System. This method of accounting is now being used by most companies. It is a system whereby information are fed into the computer thus providing uniformity in the processing of transactions.\n\nTypes of System under this method are the following:\n\n1. Simple System. Transactions are easily traced in a small computer system where the primary function performed is the sorting and manipulation of input data and the printing of output reports. There is no loss of audit trail. Audit of this type of system requires little training and background in Information Systems (IS).\n\nAn example of this type of system are shipping data that are encoded and processed throughout the system along with accounts receivable ledgers. The output is a multicopy sales invoice for each sale, an updated subsidiary ledger, and a sales journal.\n\n2. Complex System. This is characterized by the batch processing mode, the existence of one Central Processing Unit (CPU) and the extensive use of master files on magnetic media in processing. In this type of system, processing is usually confined to calculations, extensions, summarizations and the like. There is some loss of audit trail but the same is not significant. The audit of such system can be done by auditors with limited specialized training in IS auditing. Because of the extent of a printed audit trail, the auditors have the option of performing audit tests with or without the use of the computer based on his experience.\n\n3. Sophisticated System. In this type of system, transactions are initiated within the computer. There is extensive data processing and consequently, a substantial loss of audit trail. Most of the output is in machine-readable form.\n\nHeavily reliance must be placed on internal control in the audit of said system. Since many of these tests require IS skills beyond the knowledge of most auditors, IS specialists are usually called upon by the auditors.\n\nCareful advanced planning is necessary because records needed in audit and the approach to be used in testing must be made before data are processed.\n\nV. Accounting Periods\n\nAccounting periods are generally classified into two. They are:\n\n1. Calendar year; and\n\n2. Fiscal year\n\nA. Calendar Year\u2014 is an accounting period which starts from January 1, and ends on December 31. This is used by most taxpayers who elect the calendar year as their accounting period. However, the calendar year shall be the basis of computing the net income in the following cases:\n\n1. when the taxpayer is an individual;\n\n2. when the taxpayer does not keep books of accounts; and\n\n3. when the taxpayer has no annual accounting period.\n\nB. Fiscal year \u2014 is an accounting period of twelve months ending on the last day of any month other than December 31.\n\nCorporations and duly registered general co-partnerships are allowed to use this type of accounting period.\n\nA taxpayer may have a taxable period of less than twelve (12) months in the following cases:\n\n1. when a corporation is newly organized and commenced operations on any day within the year;\n\n2. when a corporation changes its accounting period;\n\n3. when a corporation is dissolved;\n\n4. when the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, by authority, terminates the taxable period of a taxpayer pursuant to Section 6 (D) of the Tax Code; and\n\n5. in case of final return of the decedent and such period ends at the time of his death.\n\nChange in Accounting Period \u2014 An individual cannot change his accounting period from the calendar year to the fiscal year. He is only allowed to use the calendar year.\n\nA corporation and a general co-partnership have the option to choose between the calendar year and the fiscal year.\n\nThe application for a change in accounting period should be filed in writing with the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, through the Revenue District Office, where the business is registered, within thirty (30) days prior to the date fixed for filing of the return on the basis of the original accounting period designating therein the proposed date for the closing of its new taxable year.\n\nVI. Financial Statements\n\nFinancial Statements are reports signifying the end result of the financial accounting process. These reports are as follows:\n\nA. Income Statement \u2014 is a report that summarizes the business activities for a given period and reports the net income or loss resulting from operations and from certain other activities. It is variously called the earnings statement, the statement of profit and loss, and the statement of operations. It normally consists of the following sections or items:\n\n1. Sales \u2014 reports the total sales to customers and fees received from clients for the period. All sales transactions should be recorded and invoiced. EaISTD\n\n2. Cost of goods sold \u2014 refers to cost of goods relating to sales when merchandise is acquired from outsiders. This is the sum of the beginning inventory, purchases and all other buying, freight and storage costs relating to the acquisition of goods and subtracting the ending inventory thereof. When the goods are manufactured by the seller, the cost of goods manufactured must first be calculated. This is the sum of the cost of goods in process at the beginning, the cost of materials put into production, the cost of labor applied and factory overhead incurred. The total cost as thus obtained represents the cost of both completed work and uncompleted work still in production. The ending goods in process inventory, then, must be subtracted from this total in arriving at the cost of the product completed and made available for sale.\n\n3. Operating expenses \u2014 are expenses incurred or utilized in the course of business or pursuant to the practice of profession. They are generally reported in two categories:\n\n3.1 Selling expenses; and\n\n3.2 General and administrative expenses\n\nIn case of self-employed individual taxpayers, professionals, non-resident aliens, estates and trusts engaged in trade or business, general professional partnerships and their individual partners, allowable expenses are subject to the provisions of Section 34 of the Tax Code. However, in lieu of the deductions allowed under the aforementioned section of the Tax Code, an individual subject to tax under Section 24, other than non-resident aliens, may elect a standard deduction in an amount not exceeding ten percent (10%) of his gross income.\n\n4. Other Income and Expenses \u2014 include items identified with financial management and miscellaneous recurring activities. Other income include interest and dividend income and income from rentals, royalties and service fees. Other expenses include interest expense and expenses related to the miscellaneous income items reported.\n\nB. Balance Sheet\u2014 is a report that shows the financial position of the business unit as of a specified moment of time. It is a status report rather than a flow report. It is variously called statement of financial position, statement of condition, statement of resources and liabilities and the statement of net worth. The balance sheet is the fundamental accounting statement in the sense that every accounting transaction can be analyzed in terms of its effect on the balance sheet. In order to understand the information a balance sheet conveys and how economic events affect the balance sheet, it is essential that the reader be absolutely clear as to the meaning of its two sides in the equation:\n\nASSETS = LIABILITIES +OWNER'S EQUITY\n\n1. Assets \u2014 are economic benefits obtained or controlled by a particular entity as a result of past transactions or events. They include those costs that have not been matched with revenues in the past and are expected to afford economic utility in the production of revenue in the future. It includes both monetary assets, such as cash, marketable securities and receivables and non-monetary assets, those costs recognized as recoverable; and hence, properly assignable to revenues of future period, such as inventories, prepaid insurance, equipment and patents.\n\n2. Liabilities \u2014 measure the claims of creditors against entity resources. The method for settlement of liabilities varies. Liabilities may call for settlement by cash payment or settlement through goods to be delivered or services to be performed.\n\n3. Owner's Equity \u2014 is the residual interest in the assets of an entity that remains after deducting its liabilities. It measures the interest of the ownership group in the total resources of the enterprise. Such equities originally arise as the result of contributions by the owners and the equities change with the change in net assets resulting from operations.\n\nVII. Purpose and Standards of Audit\n\nThe basic purpose of tax examination is the determination of correct taxable income as defined by the National Internal Revenue Code and other internal revenue tax liabilities of the person or entity whose return is being examined.\n\nIn conducting the examination, the Revenue Officer's responsibility is two-fold: to the taxpayer and to the Philippine Government. Minimum standards of examination may be extended beyond the originally intended scope, or beyond minimum requirements because of situations or facts not apparent at the outset. The extent of verification to be done in any single tax examination is a matter of auditing judgment for which no rigid guide can be established.\n\nThe degree of checking or scope of a tax examination may be influenced by an analysis of the taxpayer's accounting procedures and the results achieved therefrom, for they measure the credibility of the records and the degree of the existing system of internal control of the taxpayer.\n\nStandard refers to the criteria by which the quality of performance of auditing examinations are measured.\n\nA. General Standards\n\n1. An impartial mental attitude must be maintained in all affairs relating to an examination in order to assure a fair application of tax laws, regulations and rulings.\n\n2. Professional skill and ingenuity must be exercised in the performance of the examination and the preparation of the report.\n\n3. Issues should be raised only when, in the Revenue Officer's opinion, they have real merit and only when they will contribute in the proper determination of tax liability.\n\n4. The confidential nature of all information pertaining to any assignment must be strictly observed.\n\nB. Standard of Preliminary Planning\n\n1. Sound judgment should be exercised in selecting from assigned returns those which are most likely to contain areas of non-compliance and, where otherwise permissible, survey procedures should be employed to dispose of those which do not warrant further consideration.\n\n2. Advance planning of work schedules with reasonable accuracy is essential for the effective use of time.\n\n3. A general work plan should be formulated in each case prior to contacting the taxpayer which includes the development of issues suggested by the return and other information. The following steps may be included in the work plan:\n\n3.1 Prepare a list of items which suggest a need for special consideration.\n\n3.2 Draw-up a list of questions to be asked from the taxpayer.\n\n3.3 Identify other agencies or offices where the Revenue Officer can have access to their records if the taxpayer cannot present the documents requested.\n\nC. Standards of Field Work\n\n1. Audits should normally be performed at the taxpayer's place of business because of the accessibility of the books and records and to permit actual observation of taxpayers facilities and scope of operations. Otherwise, it should be performed in the office of the Bureau of Internal Revenue.\n\n2. The use of accounting skills, tax knowledge and ingenuity should be directed toward recognizing and raising issues which relate to non-compliance areas.\n\n3. Adequate evidential matter should be obtained through inspection, observation, inquiry, analysis and documentation to afford a reasonable basis for consideration of each issue with regard to the position of both the government and the taxpayer.\n\n4. The position taken with respect to each issue should be supported by adequate authority.\n\nD. Standards of Reporting\n\n1. Reports are to be prepared in a complete, clear, concise, and legible manner in order that they may be easily read and understood.\n\n2. Working papers should be legible, in the Revenue Officer's own handwriting, properly labeled, indexed, signed and arranged in a logical and orderly manner. aEIcHA\n\n3. Working papers should be used as a practical and professional tool to aid the Revenue Officer in the discussion of issues or questions with the taxpayer or his authorized representative. It also generally provides a record of the audit procedures undertaken by the Revenue Officer.\n\nE. Standards of Public Relations\n\n1. Initial contact for audit arrangements should be made with the taxpayer and care should be exercised in explaining the type of records required.\n\n2. Revenue Officers must be fully cognizant of the proper sources for gathering information and of the rights of the taxpayer and his representatives.\n\n3. Necessary time and patience should be devoted to a discussion of any proposed adjustments to ensure that the taxpayer has a proper understanding of the issues.\n\n4. Tact and discretion are required in pointing out errors in books and records in order to avoid discrediting an employee or representative of the taxpayer.\n\nVIII. Preliminary Approach to Examination\n\nA. Pre-Audit Analysis of Tax Return\n\nAnalysis of the return is essential to an effective audit. Preliminary analysis is used to identify potential issues which will be developed further after contacting the taxpayer. All information contained in any attachment to the tax return should be thoroughly and completely scrutinized to ascertain whether or not all of the information is adequately reflected in the tax return. Before contacting the taxpayer, the Revenue Officer should familiarize himself with the following:\n\n1. The business organization of the taxpayer and whether it has business establishments other than its main or head office;\n\n2. The location of the business and its branches as this has a relation to the volume of business;\n\n3. The economic activity in which the taxpayer is engaged in;\n\n4. The accounting books and records that would ordinarily be kept;\n\n5. The accounting methods and policies and the degree of internal control;\n\n6. The overall composition of the tax return;\n\n7. The types of income reported;\n\n8. The reasonableness of deductions;\n\n9. Unusual or unfamiliar items;\n\n10. Apparently questionable or unallowable items;\n\n11. Gross profit and selling expense percentage as well as significant variations between prior and current years;\n\n12. Inconsistencies between items and also in the treatment with respect to bad debts, inventory valuation methods, depreciation rates and methods, etc.;\n\n13. Prior years entries in the reconciliation schedules of retained earnings in a corporate return and of a partner's capital account in a partnership return which affect the year under examination;\n\n14. The status of the retained earnings account as well as the basis of assets and depreciation allowed or allowable; and\n\n15. The report of the tax liabilities of the taxpayer for the immediately preceding period in order to be aware of the deficiencies that were reported. Review of prior year's examination records will clarify some doubts or questions in the Revenue Officer's mind regarding certain items or bring light to situation that otherwise would have remained concealed on the basis of the return alone.\n\nB. Work Planning\n\nWork properly planned achieves good results.\n\nIn order to avoid any situation where the Revenue Officer will be faced with a situation of a cramped audit workload and schedule, he should prioritize the audit of the assigned cases in the following manner:\n\n1. Returns or cases where the statute of limitations is about to prescribe should be given first priority. Prescriptive period is three (3) years counted from the date prescribed by law for the filing of the return, provided that in case a return is filed beyond the prescribed period, the three-year period shall be counted from the day the return; was filed.\n\n2. Claims for refund should be given the next priority in order to develop good BIR-taxpayer relationship.\n\n3. Cases assigned for reinvestigation should also be given priority attention.\n\n4. Returns which would be more productive in terms of revenues should be given precedence over the less productive ones.\n\nIn work planning, an Audit Program should be prepared for each and every case. An Audit Program is a checklist of the various auditing procedures to be undertaken and the various books of accounts, records, documents and business forms to be verified in order to assess the correct tax due from a taxpayer. This checklist would serve as a guide for the Revenue Officer to conduct a \"quality audit\" within the time frame allowed to conclude a tax audit. It is also a tool of the tax administrators to check on the progress of the tax audit and for proper evaluation of the performance of the Revenue Officer.\n\nC. Contact With Taxpayer\n\n1. Arranging for an Appointment\n\nA telephone or a personal call by the Revenue Officer should be made to the taxpayer himself and not his representative.\n\n2. Serving of Letter of Authority\n\n2.1 On the first opportunity of the Revenue Officer to have personal contact with the taxpayer, he should present the Letter of Authority (LA) together with a copy of the Taxpayer's Bill of Rights. The LA should be served by the Revenue Officer assigned to the case and no one else. He should have the proper identification card and should be in proper attire.\n\n2.2 A Letter of Authority authorizes or empowers a designated Revenue Officer to examine, verify and scrutinize a taxpayer's books and records in relation to his internal revenue tax liabilities for a particular period.\n\n2.3 A Letter of Authority must be served or presented to the taxpayer within 30 days from its date of issue; otherwise, it becomes null and void unless revalidated. The taxpayer has all the right to refuse its service if presented beyond the 30-day period depending on the policy set by top management. Revalidation is done by issuing a new Letter of Authority or by just simply stamping the words \"Revalidated on _____________\" on the face of the copy of the Letter of Authority issued. ASICDH\n\n3. Request for Accounting Records\n\nThe Revenue Officer should clearly specify the records he desires to be assembled for his examination. Among the books and records that may be required are:\n\n3.1 receipts (official receipts, warehouse receipts, delivery receipts, etc.)\n\n3.2 invoices (sales and purchases invoices)\n\n3.3 vouchers\n\n3.4 cancelled checks\n\n3.5 bills and statements of accounts (utility bills, payment notices, etc.)\n\n3.6 contracts (sales/purchase contracts, loan contracts)\n\n3.7 journals (regular and subsidiary journals)\n\n3.8 ledgers (regular and subsidiary ledgers)\n\n4. Initial Interview\n\nThe initial interview is the most important part of the examination process and should be conducted in all audits.\n\nRequest should be made for a personal interview with the taxpayer himself.\n\nThe interrogation should be so conducted as to encourage the taxpayer to contribute willingly useful information which will assist in the proper determination of his tax liability. The information developed by this method will determine the eventual outcome of the case. The preliminary interview should, as far as practicable, cover the following:\n\n4.1 Discussion of sources of income \u2014 This may uncover possible sources of income which have not been reported such as interests on investments and deposits, dividends, rents, sales of properties as well as information on the taxpayer's financial history and standard of living;\n\n4.2 Records kept for each source of income;\n\n4.3 Handling and recording of cash transactions;\n\n4.4 Records of loans from banks and/or loans to others\n\n4.5 Real or personal properties bought or sold in current year;\n\n4.6 Correctness of personal and additional exemptions claimed;\n\n4.7 Other items that would be relevant in the examination, to wit;\n\na. The responsible officers of the firm in order to facilitate acquisition of information/data:\n\nb. Place and time of audit.\n\nc. Ocular inspection of the factory, branches, outlets, etc.;\n\nd. Officers to whom the tax audit findings will be discussed; and\n\ne. Financial history and standard of living of the owner/owners.\n\nD. Preliminary Evaluation of Miscellaneous Records\n\nThe investigation on the taxpayer's books of accounts may begin with miscellaneous records other than accounting ledgers and journals. More often than not, scrutiny of these records may reveal items which the Revenue Officer should take into consideration as the examination progresses. The records and information to be obtained are the following:\n\n1. Minute Book\n\nThe review of the minute book should not be confined to the taxable year under audit but should cover at least some period immediately before or after. As the Revenue Officer scans the minute book, he should note appropriate transactions and items of significance, such as contracts entered into by the taxpayer, stock issuance, dividend declaration and compensation of officers.\n\n2. Stock Transfer Book\n\nThis book contains the names of stockholders, past and present, with the number of shares cancelled and issued. This book is also vital in computing documentary stamp tax, liabilities. A general knowledge of the names of large shareholders is also of value when checking the salary expense. When the stock and transfer book is not available, the record of dividend payment is an alternative source of similar information.\n\n3. Partnership Agreement\n\nA copy of the partnership agreement should be obtained and certain provisions affecting partner's salaries, profit and loss sharing, interest on capital, other allowances and other matters which may have tax consequences should be noted.\n\n4. Audit Report of Independent Auditors\n\nThe Revenue Officer should read the auditor's report accompanying the financial statements. Sometimes, Revenue Officers fail to evaluate the auditor's report. However, there are cases when auditors do not issue an unqualified opinion. Any qualification or unusual comments in the auditor's report or certificate such as expression of opinion as to taxpayer's depreciation policy, inventory and cost valuation, adequacy of reserves, status of collectibility of receivables and the like should be noted for consideration and should be related to the examination of accounts.\n\nIn cases where the auditor issues two reports, one for management and the other for attachment to the tax return, the former should be studied and compared with the latter. Income and net worth in both reports may vary from income and net worth per books due to the auditor's adjusting entries not reflected in the books. Thus, the adjusting entries and supporting documents should be examined. If needed, the auditor's working papers should be looked into to explain these entries.\n\n5. Auditor's Working Papers\n\nAudits, particularly of large companies, may frequently be simplified and facilitated, if the examining Revenue Officers are given access to the auditor's working papers. Where necessary, authorization from the taxpayer or requests for access to said working papers signed by duly authorized officials shall be secured to be able to scrutinize the working papers of auditors, particularly the year-end adjustments, intercompany transactions, nature of receivables and other peculiar accounts.\n\n6. Statements and Schedules Filed with Government Regulatory Agencies\n\nCertain taxpayers are required to file financial statements and other reports with government bodies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission for corporate taxpayers, the Garments and Textile Export Board for-garments exporters, the Board of Investments for exporters, and other similar government offices. The Revenue Officer should compare the statements filed with the Bureau of Internal Revenue against those filed with other government offices. Any discrepancy should be inquired into and material differences should undergo an in-depth investigation.\n\n7. Appraisal Reports\n\nAppraisal reports, particularly real estate appraisals, are important in many cases such as for estate tax valuation of properties, capital gains tax verification, and donor's tax investigation.\n\nE. Initial Examination Techniques\n\n1. Understanding the Taxpayer's Books and Records\n\nOne technique that should be commonly used is for the Revenue Officer to interview the taxpayer or his representative and ask him to walk him through the book recording of a sale, purchase and expense transaction in order to have a thorough understanding of the taxpayer's accounting system and records.\n\n2. Reconciliation of Books and Returns\n\nAnother step in understanding the records is to perform a reconciliation of the books with the return. The following actions are recommended to assist the Revenue Officer in the reconciliation process:\n\n2.1 Request for a Chart of Accounts and identify account numbers and account titles.\n\n2.2 Identify unusual accounts. AHaETS\n\n2.3 Scan the general ledger to discover unusual account entries.\n\n2.4 Ask the taxpayer for the tax working papers or any other type of working papers that were used to prepare the return.\n\nIf the working papers are in the hands of the external auditor, the taxpayer should be advised to secure a copy thereof from their auditor.\n\nIf no working papers are available, request the taxpayer to prepare the reconciliation and supporting schedules used to arrive at the reconciliation of data as reflected in the books and the tax returns.\n\n2.5 Evaluate the Statement of Changes in Financial Position, if the taxpayer has one, to identify sales and purchases of fixed assets, investments made and disposed, loan and debt payments, capital contributions and other transactions that might not be readily apparent on the balance sheet and income statement.\n\n3. Performance of Compliance Tests\n\nThe Revenue Officer should establish the level of reliance that can be placed on the books and records and determine whether the books show all the transactions which occurred.\n\nTo accomplish this, a compliance test should be performed on some transactions through the backward and forward approaches in verification as follows:\n\n3.1 In the backward approach, the figures per tax return are traced to the trial balance, then to the general ledger, the various journals, and ultimately to the source documents such as sales invoice or official receipts.\n\n3.2 In the forward approach, the Revenue Officer should select a supporting document, say a sales invoice, and trace it through the sales journal, general ledger, trial balance and finally to the tax return.\n\nThe backward approach is effective in checking unsupported expenses while the forward approach is used in uncovering unreported income.\n\n4. Analysis of Adjusting Journal Entries\n\nIt is important that the Revenue Officer understands adjusting journal entries because tax issues are frequently discovered in the adjusting journal entries. These adjusting journal entries are usually accruals, deferrals, corrections or reclassifications of accounts.\n\n4.1 Accruals are normally entries to record certain known and fixed amount of obligations or liabilities. Accruals are also used to book uncertain,. contingent liabilities. Contingent liabilities are not fixed in amount or date and are not deductible for tax purposes.\n\n4.2 Deferrals are typically used to defer or postpone recognition of income or expenses. An inspection of the deferred income account may reflect amounts representing services already performed. It may also show goods already shipped and received by the customer. In both of these situations, a deferral of income is not proper.\n\n4.3 Corrections of prior year's earnings, other adjustments and reclassifications are made through adjusting journal entries which are recorded in the general journal or in the journal vouchers. Usually, these entries are taken from the auditor's working papers. The examining Revenue Officer should scrutinize these entries, specially those credited directly to retained earnings, analyze the tax issues involved, and note down possible tax assessments.\n\n4.4 When scanning adjusting journal entries, the following should also be looked into closely:\n\n4.4.1 Unusual and non-recurring entries;\n\n4.4.2 Entries reducing assets as there could possibly be unreported gain on sale, incorrectly computed gain on sale, incorrectly computed installment sale, non-taxable exchange, or withdrawal of goods by the owner; and\n\n4.5 Entries increasing liabilities as these could represent fictitious or contingent liabilities, fictitious expenses, invalid loans to shareholders, or undeclared income credited to liability accounts.\n\nF. Evaluation of Internal Control\n\nInternal Control is a system of procedures in place to ensure that all business transactions are properly recorded and assets are adequately safeguarded.\n\nIt is mandatory for the Revenue Officer to evaluate internal control for him to decide up to what extent the system can be relied upon. This will also determine the nature, extent and timing of audit tests to be applied in the examination and to plan subsequent audit procedures.\n\n1. Principles of Internal Control\n\nGood internal control assures good record keeping and the inability of the employees and the owner from misappropriating the assets.\n\nSome broad principles of internal control are:\n\n1.1 Responsibilities should be clearly established.\n\n1.2 Adequate records should be maintained.\n\n1.3 Assets should be insured and employees bonded.\n\n1.4 Record keeping and custody should be separated.\n\n1.5 Responsibility for related transactions should be divided.\n\n1.6 Personnel should be rotated.\n\n1.7 Automation should be used whenever practical.\n\n1.8 Employees should be informed of prescribed procedures.\n\n1.9 The system should be under constant review.\n\n2. Elements of Internal Control\n\nInternal control can be divided into three elements:\n\n2.1 Control Environment\n\nThis includes the entity's organizational structure, methods of assigning authority and responsibility, engagement in related-party transactions and compliance with various laws, rules, and regulations.\n\n2.2 Accounting System\n\nThis consists of the methods and records established to capture financial transactions such as sales, purchases, investments and payment of expenses and liabilities. This element is important to the Revenue Officer for him to understand how transactions are initiated and recorded and to determine the degree of reliability to be placed in the taxpayers books and records.\n\n2.3 Control Procedures\n\nThese include the adequate use of documents to ensure the proper recording, valuation and timing of transactions. Reconciliations of accounts should be done periodically and management should review reports for accuracy and completeness.\n\n3. Standard Procedures in Evaluating Internal Control\n\nTo establish the scope of the audit and degree of compliance tests to be performed, internal control should first be valuated based on the following techniques:\n\n3.1 Identify the personnel responsible for record keeping and determine their responsibilities and authority in the business operation.\n\n3.2 Reconcile the returns with the books and records. Difficulty in reconciling the return with the books and records may be an indication of inadequate internal control in either financial or tax accounting.\n\n3.3 Interview responsible company personnel and observe business operations.\n\n3.4 Review the chart of accounts and identify unusual accounts or note those accounts which should be included but not indicated.\n\n3.5 Secure and study copies of operating manuals or instructional booklets that may lead to an easy understanding of the taxpayer's business operations.\n\n3.6 Determine if the taxpayer's personal transactions are segregated from business operations or if separate bank accounts are maintained by the owner and the business.\n\n3.7 Determine if bank accounts are reconciled monthly.\n\n3.8 Determine the books and records maintained and the frequency of recording transactions.\n\n3.9 Determine if pre-numbered documents are being used.\n\n3.10 Determine the extent of involvement of auditors and other third parties in the business.\n\n3.11 Determine if certified audits for any reason were conducted. If so, copies of documents in relation thereto should be secured. HIAESC\n\n3.12 Determine if the income reported by the taxpayer reflects his lifestyle.\n\nThe effective evaluation of internal control is dependent upon a very good interview, observation of the business operation, and testing of the system.\n\nG. Sampling Techniques\n\nSampling is a large and important part of the examination of a tax return. It is the application of examination procedures to less than 100% of the items in an account to evaluate its accuracy.\n\n1. Two Basic Types of Sampling\n\n1.1 Statistical Sampling\n\nStatistical sampling is the formal mathematical selection and examination of transactions, amounts or accounts based on the probability that moderately large number of items taken as samples will produce results from which conclusions may be made.\n\n1.2 Judgmental Sampling\n\nIn selecting accounts and transactions to be tested, judgmental sampling should be applied as it involves the use of professional judgment in planning and performing the sampling and analyzing the results.\n\nJudgmental sampling may include any or both of the following methods:\n\n1.2.1 Block Sampling \u2014 uses groups of continuous items selected from an account balance or class of transactions. An example is a Revenue Officer's decision to sample one month of travel expense to reach a conclusion for the year.\n\n1.2.2 Peso limitation sampling or cut-off sampling \u2014 selects a minimum peso amount and transactions in excess of the said amount are verified.\n\n2. Factors to be Considered in Planning the Sample\n\n2.1 Internal Control\n\nThe extent of sampling to be done is dependent on the degree of internal control. Thus, a small sample size is required if internal control can be greatly relied upon.\n\n2.2 Accounting System\n\nLarge errors or high frequency of errors in the accounting system may require a large sample size.\n\n2.3 Materiality\n\nIn choosing appropriate material limits, the absolute size of an item, the relative size and the nature of the business, and industry/business practice should be considered. Materiality of an item should be related to its tax consequence.\n\n2.4 Analytical Review\n\nIn analytical review, the following considerations should be studied:\n\na. Taxpayer's standard of living\n\nb. Interest in closely held companies\n\nc. Transactions between related parties\n\nd. Transaction involving questions of fraud\n\ne. Significant increases or decreases in taxable income from year to year\n\nf. Significant adjustments on previous Revenue Officer's reports\n\n3. Sampling Techniques to be Applied in Testing Accounts and Transactions\n\nThere are many sampling techniques as there are cases. The Revenue Officer is not precluded from discovering and applying new techniques as may be needed in each particular case.\n\nListed below are the suggested sampling techniques in testing income statement and balance sheet items:\n\n3.1 Select the first and last months of sales to ensure that income was not deferred to an improper year.\n\n3.2 The last month of the period under examination should be tested because of the likelihood of errors and unallowable adjustments made before the end of the year.\n\n3.3 Selection of the largest three months incurrence of an expense account may reveal expenses that should be capitalized, personal expenses or padded expenses.\n\n3.4 Scan the cash disbursements journal and general ledger for unusual or very large entries. This step also familiarizes the Revenue Officer with the accounts, payees, suppliers and clients of the taxpayer.\n\n3.5 Select at least one month's (or one week for a large corporation) file of cancelled checks. Thoroughly analyze each check together with the endorsement at the back. This could lead to the discovery of fictitious; payees, unusual transactions, personal items charged to expense and other possible disallowances.\n\n3.6 Inspection of the corporate minutes and the articles of incorporation could lead to a Revenue Officer's determination to sample a particular account.\n\n3.7 Examine certain accounts in the income statement in relation to the balance sheet accounts. Thus, Accounts Receivable should be analyzed together with Sales. Bad Debts Expense should be verified together with the Allowance for Bad Debts. Likewise, Accounts Payable should be examined together with Purchases and other related expenses.\n\n3.8 Test-check source documents and related transactions by considering the persons involved, nature of the contract, mode of payment and other important aspects.\n\n3.9 Rounded figures should be checked as they may be estimates.\n\n3.10 Utilize results of analytical review in selecting the sample.\n\n3.11 Contract or limit the scope of the sample if the majority of the samples are completed and there are still no discrepancies.\n\n4. Examining the Sample Items\n\nThe sample items, as selected, should be verified as follows:\n\n4.1. Analyze and determine the validity of the source documents.\n\n4.2. Examine collaborating documents.\n\n4.3. Check with third parties.\n\n4.4. Inspect and observe inventory flow, fixed assets acquired, sales transactions and other transactions which may require ocular inspection.\n\n5. Analyzing the Results\n\nAnalyzing- the results of a sample is an important yet commonly missed step. The sample taken should be evaluated and considered in relation to any peculiar situation, such as related -party transactions or economically unsound transactions. One example would be purchases made at unusually high or low prices. If the results of the sampling indicates potential tax assessment, an in-depth analysis should be conducted as follows:\n\n5.1. Verify the account showing the discrepancy or possible source of tax deficiency.\n\n5.2. Trace the audit trail involving the transaction.\n\n5.3. Perform a 100% verification of such account.\n\n5.4. Consider performing third-party checks to substantiate transactions.\n\n5.5. Take a close look at how the taxpayer handled the entire transaction.\n\n5.6. Consider the adjustments associated to other accounts.\n\n5.7. Discuss the problems or discrepancies with the taxpayer or his authorized representative.\n\n6. Concluding the Sampling Results\n\nThe audit samples should be clearly documented in the working papers from which a conclusion shall be drawn. If a quality sample analysis has been performed, it will be easy to form a conclusion from the sample results. The conclusion reached should be clear, concise and final.\n\nIX. Balance Sheet Approach To Examination\n\nA series of suggestions on the procedures for commencing the examination of tax returns and appropriate accounting records have already been presented. The initial phase includes a verification of the net income per books with the reconciling items reflected in the tax return.\n\nAfter the foregoing process, the Revenue Officer should turn his attention primarily to the books and records bearing in mind that there are some reconciling items which affect the net income per books.\n\nThe following discussion offer guides and techniques in examining asset, liability and net worth accounts. The Revenue Officer, however, is not precluded from applying other techniques which are deemed necessary in a particular case.\n\nA. Cash on Hand and in Bank\n\n1. Compare deposits shown in the bank statement against entries in the cash receipts book and official receipts. .Note down any unrecorded or unreceipted deposit and investigate the source.\n\n2. Test check cash sales with the cash receipts book if they have been correctly recorded. Also check cash sales made at the beginning and end of the period under examination to determine if year-end sales have been recorded in the proper accounting period.\n\n3. Investigate entries in the general ledger cash account. Look for unusual items which do not originate from cash receipts or disbursements journals. These entries may indicate unauthorized withdrawals or expenditures, sales of capital assets, omitted sales, undisclosed bank accounts, etc. AcICTS\n\n4. Review cash receipts journal for items not identified with ordinary business sales, being alert to such items as sale of assets, miscellaneous income, sale of scrap, income received in advance, proceeds from issuance of capital stock and other taxable transactions.\n\n5. Review cash on hand and cash in bank accounts to determine if there are any credit balances during the period under examination. This may indicate unrecorded receipts.\n\n6. Review cash disbursements journal for a representative period. Note any missing check numbers, checks payable to cash, large or unusual items and determine propriety thereof through a comparison with vouchers, journal entries and other related accounting records.\n\n7. If the taxpayer is on cash basis, ascertain if checks were written and recorded at the close of the period under audit but were issued thereafter. Verify checks issued during the latter part of the year to check the authenticity of expenses claimed.\n\n8. Give special consideration to checks issued for cashier's checks, sight drafts and other similar bank instruments where the payees and nature of the disbursements are clearly shown.\n\n9. Obtain bank statements and cancelled checks for each bank account for one or more months, including the last month of the period under examination.\n\n10. Note year-end bank overdrafts. This may indicate expenses which are fictitious or unallowable since funds were not available for payment.\n\n11. Determine if there are checks which have remained outstanding for an unreasonable period of time. This may indicate improper, fictitious or duplication of disbursements. Old outstanding checks could possibly be restored to income.\n\n12. Determine whether voided checks have been properly adjusted in the books and credited to the appropriate expense accounts, if applicable.\n\n13. For a test period, check endorsements to verify if they are the same as that of the payees', noting any endorsements by the owner, or any questionable endorsement.\n\n14. If records appear unreliable or have not been subjected to a competent independent audit, tests of footings and postings should be made for a representative period.\n\n15. Test check disbursements from petty cash to determine if there are any unallowable items included.\n\n16. Scrutinize cash overages and shortages, being alert to occurrence of irregularities.\n\n17. Tally debits and credits to the cash accounts per month against sales credit, debts to purchases and expense accounts and other sources and application of cash based on the worksheet of real and nominal accounts submitted by the taxpayer. Note down discrepancies and substantial accumulation of cash without reasonable credits.\n\nB. Notes and Accounts Receivable\n\n1. Secure a breakdown of the receivables by class, whether notes or accounts and by debtors, such as customers, affiliated companies, officers, stockholders, employees and others.\n\n2. Check entries in the general ledger control accounts. Look for unusual items, especially those which do not originate from the sales or cash receipts journals.\n\n3. Determine if subsidiary ledgers are in agreement with control accounts, and if not, ascertain the reasons for any differences.\n\n4. Note any credit balances in the general ledger or subsidiary accounts. This may indicate deposits or overpayments which could be considered as additional income or unrecorded sales. Also, credit balances may indicate a misapplied bad debt recovery or deposits received for so long a time that there is little likelihood that they will ever be refunded. Whatever the cause, the credits, if material, should be isolated for consideration.\n\n5. Some credit sales invoices and postings should be test checked from the sales journal to the subsidiary and control account.\n\n6. Compare balances of accounts receivable and sales for the current year with that of the preceding year. Investigate significant changes.\n\n7. Investigate large and/or unusual balances classified as other accounts receivable.\n\n8. In case of notes receivable, determine whether accrued income on interest bearing notes or accounts has been included in income.\n\n9. Investigate the sources of notes receivable as there may be instances when the taxpayer has other sources of income other than his regular business.\n\n10. Determine whether accrued income on interest bearing notes or accounts has been included in income.\n\n11. If needed, check the detailed listing of beginning receivables to cash collected as reflected in the cash receipts book. This may disclose diversion of funds and other irregularities.\n\nC. Allowance for Bad Debts\n\n1. Ascertain the company's policy of providing for allowance for bad debts by examining minutes of meetings and other documents.\n\n2. Compare balances in the allowance account with that of the preceding year's. Investigate significant changes.\n\n3. Evaluate the reasonableness of the allowance by computing the ratio of the balance of allowance for bad debts to the trade accounts receivable balance.\n\n4. Compute the ratio of bad debts expense over sales. Analyze if such is reasonable.\n\n5. Review the aging schedule of accounts receivable.\n\n6. For accounts written off which were charged to expense, examine minute book for authorization to write off accounts.\n\n7. Ascertain that accounts written off are worthless by examining supporting documents such as reports of collection agencies, correspondence with said customers and documents filed in court, and court decisions on collection cases.\n\n8. If possible, check the financial status of the customers for which allowance for bad debts was provided.\n\n9. Check entries to the allowance account for possible bad debts recoveries and trace if the same were declared as income at the time of recovery.\n\nD. Inventories\n\n1. Determine the correct cost components to be included in the inventory. The costs used in determining inventory depend on whether the business is of a service, merchandising or manufacturing nature.\n\n2. Verify the inventory valuation method being applied if such is acceptable for tax purposes and consistently applied from year to year.\n\n3. Compare inventory balances in the return under examination with the balances on the prior and subsequent year's returns and financial statement; then verify these with the taxpayer's records.\n\n4. Check BIR authorization for changes in inventory valuation method and verify taxpayers compliance with the requirements set forth under existing rules and regulations.\n\n5. Check gross profit percentage variations. Conduct in-depth verification of items with substantial variations.\n\n6. Determine the significance of any notes or qualifying statements on financial reports prepared by independent accounting firms.\n\n7. Determine the taxpayer's computation of standard rates, if standard rates are applied.\n\n8. Verify cost of production reports and test check certain costs reflected therein to supporting documents.\n\n9. Determine if year-end purchases were included in the closing inventory.\n\n10. Analyze unusual entries to cost of sales account such as materials, labor and overhead charges not directly related to sales or transfers of finished goods, if applicable.\n\n11. Determine if there have been write-downs for \"excess\" inventory to below cost. Verify authorization and supporting document/report for such write-downs.\n\n12. When items have been removed from inventory for the owners' or shareholders' use, check if these are properly recorded as part of sales. These required minimum audit procedures, however, should not deter the Revenue Officer from making a more detailed examination of the inventory account, when warranted.\n\nE. Advances To Stockholders/Officers\n\nThis receivable account may represent an outright advance of money by the corporation to officers and/or stockholders. Usually, these advances vary in amounts over a period of time, consequently building up the current amount. The following verification procedures on this account should be conducted, if warranted:\n\n1. Verify authorization from Board of Directors for advances and loans to stockholders and officers by checking duly approved minutes of meetings.\n\n2. Identify company officers and stockholders who are granted advances regularly.\n\n3. Check payments of advances to the company if such loan re-payments earned interest for which no withholding tax was deducted.\n\n4. Verify entries and supporting documents on cancellation of advances if the same do not originate from cash receipts. TESDcA\n\nF. Investment\n\nThe investments most commonly found on the books are stocks and bonds and, in some cases, real estate not used in actual business operations. The following procedures should be conducted in the examination of investments if such are material assets of the taxpayer:\n\n1. Familiarize with the nature of investments, utilizing any records maintained by the taxpayers such as the investment ledgers, worksheets showing the breakdown of investments and other investment records.\n\n2. Analyze sales and other credit entries to the account. If stocks sold are listed in the stock market, test check selling price of stocks sold at the prevailing \"close\" price at the Philippine Stock Exchange during the date of sale. Real properties sold should not fall below fair market value and/or zonal value where the zonal value has been established. The application of the \"whichever is higher\" rule shall be observed.\n\n3. Verify journal entries to ascertain the selling price and gain on sale of investments. Vouch supporting documents such as deeds of sale, proof of remittance of taxes withheld, payment of documentary stamp tax and other relevant records.\n\n4. Investigate sales to related parties and/or officers or stockholders below fair market value.\n\n5. Cross-check all investments during the year to the interest, dividend or rental income accounts.\n\n6. If investments or bonds were acquired at a premium or discount, determine whether the premium/discount is amortized over the life of the bond.\n\nG. Depreciable Assets\n\nThis group includes tangible properties of relatively long life which are used in the operation of the business. However, natural resources such as oil or mineral lands are not included in this group of asset account. The following verification procedures should be undertaken on these accounts:\n\n1. Compare the asset and related reserve amounts as they appear on the tax return, balance sheet, depreciation schedule, and taxpayer's books and schedules. Compare the beginning and ending figures for the taxable year and reconcile differences or ask the taxpayer to make the necessary reconciliation. Verify the correctness of such reconciliation.\n\n2. Review depreciation schedule of fixed assets and ascertain propriety of depreciation expense claimed. Watch out for depreciation that may have been taken on assets which are already fully depreciated or charged off to expense.\n\n3. Review asset additions during the year by reference to invoices, contracts and other documents and determine if the proper cost basis was used.\n\n3.1. Note items which appear to have originated from unusual sources such as appraisal increases, transfers and exchanges, and determine propriety thereof. Ascertain if prior earnings were adequate to cover acquisitions.\n\n3.2. Determine if acquisition and installation costs of fixed assets and leasehold improvements have been capitalized.\n\n3.3. Ascertain if assets include items of a personal nature. If the assets are used by the officers for their personal use, the depreciation should be disallowed.\n\n3.4. Where construction or any other work of a capital nature is performed with the taxpayer's own labor, equipment and other assets for its own use, be certain that the basis of such asset includes materials, labor and overhead including depreciation.\n\n3.5. With regard to the basis of recognition of costs of assets, consider such items as trade-ins, acquisitions from related taxpayers, allocation of cost between land and building and other basis.\n\n4. Decreases in the asset accounts during the year should be noted. The accuracy of the gains or losses resulting therefrom should be verified and ascertain that the appropriate tax on the transaction, such as value-added tax, if applicable, has been paid.\n\n5. Ascertain if the taxpayer has transferred assets to the owner, officers, stockholders or to a controlled domestic or foreign corporation for less than fair or adequate consideration.\n\nH. Allowances For Depreciation, Amortization And Other Valuation Reserves\n\n1. Review the nature and source of all accounts and ascertain if they are being used to claim unallowable deductions.\n\n2. With regard to depreciation, determine the correctness of the amount of asset being depreciated. No depreciation is allowable on the appraisal increase of fixed assets. Any foreseeable salvage value is to be deducted from the cost of the asset in determining the basis of depreciation.\n\n2.1. No depreciation is allowable on a building until it is completed or on a machine until it is installed. Expenditures which are properly includible as an element of cost are freight-in, installation cost, title cost, and legal or brokerage fees in connection with acquisition.\n\n2.2. Where land and building are acquired on lump-sum, the following formula should be used in computing the building cost for depreciation computation:\n\n3. Ascertain the taxpayer's depreciation and amortization policies and consider the following:\n\n3.1. Whether the methods applied by the taxpayer are in compliance with the Tax Code and existing revenue regulations;\n\n3.2. Whether the depreciation rates used by the taxpayer are fair and reasonable; and\n\n3.3. Whether the taxpayer has applied the same method consistently from period to period.\n\n4. Check authorization from minutes of meetings, fixed asset reports, or other supporting documents on credits for allowance for obsolescence and/or asset write-offs. If necessary, inspect assets claimed as obsolete and/or written off.\n\nI. Intangible Assets\n\n1. Investigate the nature of the intangible assets whether leases, patents, licenses, trademarks, goodwill, copyright, franchise and others.\n\n2. Costs of acquiring the intangible should be capitalized when useful lives can be estimated. If not, no amortization is allowable for tax purposes.\n\n3. Determine if the recorded cost and cost of current additions includes proper elements such as legal fees, application fees and other costs of acquisition. Examine contracts and other legal documents.\n\n4. Verify correctness of deductions claimed as amortization of intangible assets as follows:\n\n4.1. Leasehold costs are subject to amortization over the term of the lease.\n\n4.2. Goodwill cannot be amortized if it is for an indefinite period of time.\n\n4.3. Research and development expenditures may either be capitalized or treated as outright deductible expense.\n\n4.4. Patents sold with the exclusive right to make, use and sell an article constitutes ordinary income.\n\n4.5. Organization expenses are subject to amortization and are not deductible in full on the year incurred. Check the reasonableness of the taxpayer's amortization policy on organization expense.\n\n5. Determine if there have been transactions with related taxpayers. If so, verify if these are made at arms-length.\n\n6. Determine if income applicable to intangibles has been included as income, (e.g. subleases, overriding royalties, franchise and other sources).\n\n7. Analyze any transaction involving transfer of foreign rights to any foreign entity for an equity interest or for nominal consideration.\n\n8. Be alert to transactions which could have given rise to intangibles classifiable as asset account which may have been recorded as expense.\n\nJ. Prepaid Expenses And Deferred Charges\n\n1. Verify the nature and source of these assets and the manner in which they are charged off to expense.\n\n2. When prepaid expenses are not reflected in the balance sheet, verify charges to expenses which entail advance payments such as insurance, rent, supplies, repairs and maintenance that are covered by contracts.\n\nK. Other Assets\n\n1. Obtain a schedule of other assets account when material in amount.\n\n2. Investigate sources of charges to the account. Verify entries and supporting documents to check if the other assets are results of income-generating activities not reported in the financial statements. IcHDCS\n\nL. Exchange, Clearing or Suspense Account\n\n1. Obtain a schedule to determine the nature and purpose of the account if significant in amount.\n\n2. Test check debit and credit entries, being aware of the possibility that such account may be used as a means for diverting sales, padding expenses, and concealing other irregularities.\n\nM. Current And Accrued Liabilities Including Notes Payable\n\nThese liabilities are found on business records under various titles such as accounts payable, vouchers payable, notes payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities. The audit procedures are as follows:\n\n1. Reconcile subsidiary ledgers with the control accounts. Request the taxpayer for explanation of any discrepancies noted.\n\n2. Note existence of debit balances in the general ledger or subsidiary accounts. This may indicate diversion of funds and other underdeclaration of income.\n\n3. Note accounts which have long overdue balances. These may indicate contested liabilities or accounts that no longer exist such as unclaimed wages or unclaimed deposits which should be reverted to income.\n\n4. Review computation of year-end accruals with respect to their deductibility as expenses or purchases.\n\n5. Examine legitimacy of accounts payable to affiliates or related taxpayers. Test check payments made by tracing the same to supporting documents.\n\nInvestigate entries in the general ledger control accounts. Check unusual items such as those that do not originate from the voucher register or disbursement book. This may disclose unreported income, improper claim or overstated expense.\n\n6. Be aware of any contingent liability by reviewing minutes of meetings and annual reports. Although this is not reflected in the tax return, an accrual may have been made for the item. Any claim for an expense or deduction arising from a contingent transaction shall not be considered as a deductible expense. A deductible expense must be reasonably determinable in amount and the liability must be fixed.\n\n7. If payables include liability on security deposits, secure a copy of the lease contract/agreement to determine provision on the application of lease deposits. These security deposits are taxable when received.\n\nN. Fixed Liabilities\n\n1. Acquaint with the pertinent provisions of loan contracts, mortgage agreements, certificates of indebtedness, financing arrangements and consider possible adjustment areas as follows:\n\n1.1. determination of expenses, (e.g. interest and bank charges);\n\n1.2. refunding of debt; and\n\n1.3. legal, professional and other expenses of issuance.\n\n2. Scrutinize any long-term outstanding liability to the owner, shareholders, officers or to a related taxpayer as this may constitute accumulated unreported income.\n\n3. When the liability is secured by property pledged or mortgaged as collateral for the loan, determine if the property pledged/mortgaged is income producing. Review the terms and conditions stipulated on the loan agreement to determine if income derived therefrom remains to be reported by the taxpayer as the borrower.\n\n4. Verify if funds were borrowed for use of affiliates as the interest expenses thereon shall not be deductible on the part of the borrowing taxpayer. There should be a reallocation of profits and the tax burden must be shifted to the affiliate in accordance with existing rules and regulations.\n\n5. Determine whether the indebtedness will give rise to interest expense that are subject to limitations on deductibility under Section 34(B) of the Tax Code. Determine if loans were borrowed to finance acquisition of tax-exempt securities. If so, the interest expense is not considered deductible for income tax purposes.\n\nO. Deferred Credits\n\n1. Check all payments received as recorded in the cash receipts book, (i.e. date of receipt, source of collection, and other entries).\n\n2. Check if collections were included in the gross income during the year when the payments were actually received. Amounts are generally includible in gross income for tax purposes not later than the time of receipt if they are subject to free and unrestricted use by the taxpayer. Under this theory, collections, advance rentals, legal retainer and the like, advance sales of transportations tokens or communications tickets and other advances are income when received.\n\n3. Look for credit balance of accounts which fall under deferred credits. They may be clearly labeled as advanced rentals, deferred service income or may be shown as a reserve account that is mixed with true liability accounts, or as a contra-balance in the receivables.\n\n4. If the taxpayer used the completed contract method of accounting for contracts entered into and construction work that actually commenced prior to January 1, 1998, income and expenses attributable to a particular job or project are properly deferred until completion of the project. The contracts and progress reports should be inspected to determine whether the reporting of income has been delayed beyond the completion of the project.\n\n5. When a taxpayer uses the installment method of reporting income, the unrecognized gain for tax purposes should be recorded as a deferred credit. This particular account should be checked to determine if the year-end balance remaining in the account reconciles with gross profit to be reported on the subsequent payments. Any difference would indicate erroneous computations of income from payments.\n\nP. Loans from Shareholders/Officers/Owners\n\n1. Determine whether there is a true debtor-creditor relationship. Excessively large liabilities in relation to capital stock (especially in the case of a new company) may indicate a thin capitalization situation.\n\n2. Check the financial statements of the corporation as well as that of the shareholders. If there is an interest expense account on the part of the corporation from such loan, there should also be a corresponding interest income account on the part of the shareholder.\n\nThere are certain tax advantages to the corporation or shareholder for an equity investment to be treated as a loan. Be sure that the taxpayer gets these benefits only when the facts of the case show that a \"true loan\" exists.\n\nIf \"loans\" are found to be equity capital, the following procedures may be applied:\n\n2.1. Disallow claim for interest expense and treat payments during the year as dividends.\n\n2.2. Treat loan repayments as dividends.\n\n2.3. Disallow bad debts deductions by the shareholders.\n\n3. Check supporting loan documents issued in favor of the shareholders, officers or owners. If unsupported or if support is doubtful, the unsupported income may have been lodged in this account.\n\n4. Verify certain payments of loans against check vouchers and cancelled checks.\n\n5. Verify the debit and credit entries in the general ledger account and watch out for unusual sources other than the cash receipts and disbursements book.\n\n6. Examine adjustments, specially increases in the account, at the end of the year as this may constitute shifting of taxable income to this liability account. Verify general journal entries, journal vouchers and related documents supporting the entries.\n\nQ. Capital Accounts\n\n1. Capital or Owner's Equity-for sole proprietorship\n\n1.1. 210. Reconcile amount appearing on the books, tax return and financial statements. Verify discrepancies, if any.\n\n1.2. Review debits and credits to the account during the period under audit and check supporting entries to the account. Increases which originate from sources other than profit and loss may indicate omitted income.\n\n1.3 Relate the account balance and withdrawals with the owner's standard of living. Where owners report no other sources of income, and withdrawals appear insufficient to maintain personal living expenses, there may be under reporting or diversion of income.\n\n2. Partners' Capital \u2014 for partnerships\n\n2.1. Review debits and credits to the account during the period under audit. Verify increases and decreases and check for unusual sources other than profit and loss.\n\n2.2. Reconcile amount appearing on the tax return, books and financial statements. Verify any differences noted.\n\n2.3. Examine pertinent provisions of partnership contract and check correctness of distribution of partnership income and expenses.\n\n2.4. Ascertain that the correct tax has been withheld on distribution of partnership profits.\n\n2.5. If the taxpayer claims that it is a general professional partnership, examine partnership contract and registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\n3. Stockholders' Equity-for corporations\n\n3.1. Capital Stock\n\n3.1.1. Review entries in the capital stock account and verify increases and decreases thereto.\n\n3.1.2. Verify correctness of all items appearing on the return, books and financial statements. Investigate discrepancies, if any.\n\n3.1.3. In case of additions to capital stock out of new issues during the period under audit, ascertain that the correct amount of documentary stamp tax has been paid. Secure a photocopy of the proof of payment.\n\n3.1.4. Compare data from minute book with items recorded on the books of accounts to determine if entries have been made.\n\n3.1.5. Determine if expenses relating to stock issuance (i.e. legal fees, registration fees, broker's commission and other expenses) have been properly handled.\n\n3.1.6. Determine during the examination of a recapitalization of the stock in a closely held company, if the fair market value of the stock to be received by each exchanging shareholder is equal to the fair market value of the stock surrendered in the exchange. If there is a significant difference, consider the possibility of treating the difference as a donation subject to donor's tax. cAHDES\n\n3.1.7. If a reorganization has taken place, examine the following documents:\n\n3.1.7.1 The reorganization plan;\n\n3.1.7.2 Journal entries giving effect to direct reorganization;\n\n3.1.7.3 Notes of all minute book referring to the transaction, and\n\n3.1.7.4 Notes of pertinent information from the correspondence file with other parties to the reorganization.\n\n3.1.8. Examine by-laws, articles of incorporation or other documents in support of other transactions affecting capital stock.\n\n3.1.9. Determine if the increase in capital stock is the direct consequence of an exchange of property under Section 40(C)(2) of the Tax Code. If so, confirm compliance with the conditions set for the non-recognition of gain or loss by performing the following audit procedures:\n\n3.1.9.1 In case of merger or consolidation.\n\n3.1.9.1.1 Verify if the plan of reorganization has been adopted by each of the parties to the reorganization.\n\n3.1.9.1.2 Check if the income tax return filed for the taxable year in which the exchange took place incorporated all facts pertinent to the non-recognition of gain or loss upon such exchange, such as:\n\n3.1.9.1.2.1 The historical cost or other basis of valuation of all properties, including all stocks or securities transferred incident to the plan; and\n\n3.1.9.1.2.2 The nature and amount of liability assumed upon the exchange and the amount and nature of any liabilities to which any of the property acquired in the exchange is subject.\n\n3.1.9.1.2.3 Verify Deed of Assignment of property for shares of stocks; and\n\n3.1.9.1.2.4 Check in the required documentary stamp tax has been paid.\n\n3.1.9.2 In case of transfer of property to a controlled corporation\n\n3.1.9.2.1 Verify if the transferor and the transferee filed an income tax return for the taxable year in which the exchange was consummated with a complete statement of all facts pertinent to the exchange.\n\n3.1.9.2.2 Verify Deed of Assignment of the property.\n\n3.1.9.2.3 Determine if transferor of the property gains control of said corporation, alone or together with others, not exceeding four (4) persons, pursuant to Sec. 40 (C)(2) of the NIRC.\n\n3.1.9.2.4 Determine if the documentary stamp tax was paid.\n\n3.1.9.3 In both cases, ascertain if the following information have been annotated at the back of the Transfer Certificates of Title or certificates of stock:\n\n3.1.9.3.1 Date of execution of the deed of exchange.\n\n3.1.9.3.2 The original or historical cost of property.\n\n3.1.9.3.3 The fact that no gain or loss was recognized as a result of such exchange.\n\n3.2. Retained Earnings\n\nThe investigation of the retained earnings (or deficit, in case of accumulated losses) is a very important part of the audit process as this is related to the net worth method of investigation. It is the account to which the net income or net loss from operations is transferred and accumulated into. The minimum audit procedures that should be undertaken in analyzing this account are as follows:\n\n3.2.1. Compare the amount of earnings retained in the business as shown on the return, financial statements, books of accounts and the schedule of reconciliation of net income per books and per return. Verify differences, if any.\n\n3.2.2. Verify correctness of all items, both increases and decreases, appearing on the books or return. Trace beginning balance of retained earnings to the ending balance appearing in the balance sheet of the prior period.\n\n3.2.3. Check increases which do not originate from net income. Verify entries from the general journal/journal vouchers, specially those recorded other than as year-end adjustment as these may indicate sales or income directly posted to the retained earnings account.\n\n3.2.4. Determine if declared and unpaid dividends are properly recorded. Compare paid dividends to the minutes of the Board of Directors meeting(s).\n\n3.2.5. For taxpayers incurring continuous losses and deficit balance, investigate the real status of the business. Tour company premises, evaluate the volume of business, and compare the information gathered with the financial data reported. There may be underreporting of sales as there is very little reason for a business to exist if it is continuously incurring losses.\n\n3.2.6. Examine supporting documents and authorization for all other debit and credit transactions in retained earnings to determine conformity with existing tax laws and regulations.\n\nX. Audit of Income and Expenses\n\nThis Chapter discusses the books of accounts, accounting records and documents used to record income and expense transactions. It enumerates the audit procedures and techniques for income and expenses.\n\nThe audit of income or revenues are applicable to resident and non-resident individuals engaged in business and the practice of profession, estates and trusts engaged in trade or business, general professional and business partnerships and corporations.\n\nExpenses chargeable against income are allowable in their entirety only for business partnerships and corporations. Self-employed resident citizens and aliens engaged in business or the practice of profession, non-resident aliens engaged in business, estates and trusts engaged in trade or business and general professional partnerships as defined under Section 22 (B) of the Tax Code and their individual partners can claim expenses subject to the provisions of Section 34 of the Tax Code.\n\nThe subsequent discussions on the procedures and techniques in the investigation of income and expense accounts are general audit guides. The Revenue Officer should not be hindered in applying additional procedures and techniques, which he deems necessary, based on his initial findings, evaluation of internal control, reliability of accounting records, and analytical review of operations.\n\nA. Audit of Income Accounts\n\n1. Sales\n\n1.1 Review the taxpayer's accounting method of revenue recognition if the same is acceptable and consistent with prior years.\n\n1.2 Ascertain that all sales were reported as of the cut-off date. Cut-off refers to the point at which entries from one accounting period stop and entries for the next period begin. This is usually the last day of a taxable year. If the last day of the taxable year is not used, the cut-off date must be the last day of the taxpayer's fiscal period. ASTcEa\n\n1.3 Verify revenues/sales recorded and deposited near the end of the tax year and immediately during the subsequent month to determine if these pertain to income earned for the tax year under examination.\n\n1.4 Account for all sales invoices issued. Match delivery receipts, gate passes, if any, against sales invoices issued.\n\n1.5 Compare totals of sales invoices, sales summary, entries in subsidiary sales journals and general ledger accounts. Inquire and investigate discrepancies between book entries and returns filed.\n\n1.6 Reconcile credits to sales with debits to accounts receivable and debits to cash receipts book. Test check monthly entries.\n\n1.7 Research unusual and unfamiliar issuances of goods or goods which are not normally sold by the taxpayer.\n\n1.8 Conduct interviews to secure information regarding the taxpayer's business, financial history, number of employees and other information which may lead to sales estimation.\n\n1.9 Determine inventory method applied if acceptable and consistently followed.\n\n1.10 Determine if merchandise is being withdrawn for personal use or for any other purpose not in relation to normal sales process.\n\n1.11 Scan credit memo issued to customers and test check entries to Sales Returns & Allowances and Sales Discounts to insure proper recording of credits.\n\n1.12 Verify cancelled sales invoices by test checking deposits made and withdrawal of goods on the day of cancellation.\n\n1.13 Tour the business premises to obtain information on:\n\na. Sales volume\n\nb. Volume of sales return and method of handling sales returns\n\nc. Major products\n\nd. Other by-products and scrap sales, if any\n\ne. Equipment used in operation\n\nf. Nature, quality and size of facilities\n\ng. Inventory level\n\nIn touring the premises, be observant and ask questions that will disclose significant facts and information relative to the taxpayer's business operations.\n\n1.14 Review sales contracts, consignment agreements and other documents relative to sales.\n\n1.15 On installment sales, ascertain that collections have been properly segregated as to the year of sales and that the proper gross profit ratios have been applied. Review unearned or deferred income accounts for any uncollected balances which have been outstanding for an unreasonable period of time.\n\n1.16 Determine whether sales on consigned goods are taken up at the time of shipment or after sixty (60) days from the date goods were consigned.\n\n1.17 Where the internal control is weak and records are unreliable or inadequate, apply other approaches to audit revenue such as cash analysis, net-worth analysis, third party verification, and other indirect approaches to investigation.\n\n2. Rent Income\n\n2.1 Obtain and review copies of lease contracts.\n\n2.2 Conduct ocular inspection of the premises under lease. Identify tenants and monthly or annual rentals. Conduct interviews, if necessary.\n\n2.3 Relate real properties under lease agreement to assets declared in the balance sheet. Note inconsistencies between asset values and income generated.\n\n2.4 Where the rental income is based on a percentage of sales of the lessee, the sales of the lessee should be tested for a representative period, say one month, to get a proper approximation of the lessee's sales during the taxable year under audit and the rental income received by the lessor. In such cases, proper authorization from the lessee should be obtained before conducting the test verification.\n\n2.5 Obtain information on rental of neighboring properties and compare with rent income reported.\n\n2.6 Examine official receipts issued. Compare total collections per official receipts with entries in the cash receipts book and general ledger. Investigate discrepancies.\n\n2.7 Ascertain acceptability and consistency of accounting methods used. For cash-basis taxpayers, prepaid rent and rental deposits constitute income during the year of receipt.\n\n2.8 Secure copies of lease contracts or agreements. Take note of lease contracts which are actually conditional sales.\n\n2.9 Where necessary, obtain copies of Transfer Certificates of Title, tax declarations, mayor's or municipal permits, and real property tax receipts to determine properties which may be undisclosed/unrecorded by the taxpayer.\n\n3. Professional Fees\n\n3.1 Determine the taxpayer's accounting method of recognizing income, whether cash or accrual. Most professionals, however, adopt the cash basis of accounting.\n\n3.2 Examine contracts with clients and other correspondence/documents in relation to professional services rendered.\n\n3.3 Compare income reported on the tax return with the books of accounts, creditable withholding tax forms, financial statements and official receipts issued. Verify discrepancies, noted, if any.\n\n3.4 Account for official receipts issued. Note any missing receipt or break in the series and investigate the reasons therefor.\n\n3.5 Analyze the reasonableness of expenses claimed in relation to income declared.\n\n3.6 Conduct interviews and third party verification, if necessary.\n\n3.7 Relate the income reported per tax return to the lifestyle and assets of the taxpayer. If the taxpayer's assets and estimated costs of living expenses are beyond the income earned, verify and compute for possible underdeclaration of income by using the net worth method of investigation.\n\n4. Income from Sale of Asset\n\n4.1 Identify in the tax returns and financial statements any sale, exchange or disposal of assets other than inventories or stocks in trade.\n\n4.2 Obtain copies of deeds of sale and other documents relating to the sale.\n\n4.3 Determine zonal values, fair market values or appraisal values and compare with the actual selling price.\n\n4.4 Compute any underdeclaration of sales by comparing the selling price with the existing fair market value, zonal value or value of similar properties sold.\n\n4.5 In case of disposal of capital assets, ascertain compliance with the provisions of the Tax Code on capital gains and losses.\n\n4.6 Verify sales of property reported on the installment basis and determine if all requirements pertaining thereto have been complied with.\n\n4.7 Determine if proper accounting for depreciation, book value and salvage value was correctly taken up\n\n4.8 Inquire from certain company personnel on possible sales of assets which may not have been recorded in the books of accounts.\n\n5. Other Income\n\n5.1 Scrutinize the entries in the general ledger and general journal for any other income or other receivables recorded thereto.\n\n5.2 Test check entries in intercompany accounts to determine whether shifting of income or management fees may have been made and charged to affiliates.\n\n5.3 Investigate suspense accounts and unusual liability accounts, such as due to affiliates/due to stockholders and other payables to uncover possible income not recorded in the income accounts.\n\nB. Audit of Expense Accounts\n\n1. Purchases\n\nFor taxpayers engaged in trading and manufacturing businesses, the purchase account is one of the largest accounts in the income statement. Thus, there is a possibility that taxpayers may hide a number of non-deductible expenditures in this account due to the volume of transactions posted to it. The following audit procedures should be followed in examining purchases:\n\n1.1 Account for all purchase invoices and receiving reports as of the cut-off date. Determine if year-end purchases have been recorded in the proper accounting period.\n\n1.2 Compare totals of purchases in the return, income statement, purchase book, subsidiary purchases book, if any, and general ledger. Determine any discrepancy and investigate its nature as well as the nature of year-end adjustments.\n\n1.3 Determine that the purchases declared are neither overstated nor understated by vouching the supporting documents, and test-checking the footings of invoices, purchase books and ledger accounts Under-statement of purchases may also mean underdeclared sales.\n\n1.4 Tour the premises where inventory items are kept and correlate actual inventory level against purchases reported. Test-check stock cards of major inventory items to evaluate accuracy of inventory reports. TDcAaH\n\n1.5 Scan the purchases book for possible unusual payees or unusual amount of purchases. Take note of suppliers not generally associated with the products or services handled by the taxpayer.\n\n1.6 Verify entries in the general ledger account which originate from unusual sources such as journal entries, debit and credit memoranda and other accounting records.\n\n1.7 Test check recorded purchases for a representative period with suppliers invoices and cancelled checks. Note if there are personal expenditures, withdrawals of merchandise by the owners, fictitious or duplicate invoices, cancelled purchase invoices, excessive rebates, discounts and allowances and purchases not received.\n\n1.8 Where there are only a few major suppliers, conduct third party verification to ascertain the correctness of purchases declared, if there is suspicion of fraud or if the Revenue Officer believes that this is necessary.\n\n1.9 If purchases are from suppliers related to the owners or from affiliates, conduct a review of a number of transactions to uncover prices in excess of market value, excessive rebates and allowances, and other similar schemes.\n\n2. Cost of Goods Sold\n\n2.1 Verify the inventory valuation method applied by the taxpayer whether first-in, first-out (FIFO) last-in, first-out (LIFO), specific identification, weighted average or simple average. Last-in, first-out is not acceptable for income tax purposes. Determine consistency of its application from year to year.\n\n2.2 Obtain an understanding of the production process thru familiarization with the taxpayer's business, tour of the premises, conducting interviews, and analyzing cost of production reports.\n\n2.3 Compare inventory balances in the return under examination with the balances for the prior and subsequent years' returns, and reconcile these with the general ledger and the physical inventory summary.\n\n2.4 Check unauthorized changes in inventory valuation method from period to period. Conduct test-checking of inventory valuation of sample inventory items from the summary inventory sheets and determine if the taxpayer has not improperly valued any inventory item.\n\n2.5 Check gross profit variations. Any significant variation should be discussed with the taxpayer and a reasonable explanation in writing should be obtained. A material decrease in gross profit from one year to the next could be due to understated ending inventory.\n\n2.6 Determine the significance of notes or qualifying statements on financial reports prepared by external auditors. Any unusual comments or qualifying statements about the inventories or cost of sales that have a material tax effect should be discussed with the taxpayer and, if necessary, with a representative of the external auditor.\n\n2.7 If the taxpayer applies standard or predetermined cost in costing goods manufactured, inspect the working papers and production report used to calculate the cost per unit and ensure that expenses included are allowable.\n\n2.8 Analyze unusual entries to cost of sales. Account for labor, materials and overhead charges not directly related to sales or transfers of finished goods. Be alert on the possibility that the taxpayer may be trying to include a non-deductible item in the cost of sales account.\n\n2.9 Determine whether year-end purchases are included in closing inventory. Review purchase invoices at the last month of the taxable year under audit. Compare quantities on the inventory summary for classes of goods purchased with the quantity in the ending inventory list and quantity of sales recorded at year-end for such goods. Thus, if a specific item or a certain quantity of goods were purchased on the last day of the year, it should be included in the ending inventory unless sold that same day.\n\n2.10 Determine reductions in ending inventory values by reviewing authorization for write-downs and provision for obsolescence or decline in market values. Check minutes of meetings for such authorization. Analyze journal entries for the write-down or provision of allowance for obsolescence/decline in value. Check itemized inventory summary sheet and test-check the list with actual physical inventory.\n\n3. Salaries, Wages and Other Employees' Benefits\n\n3.1 Evaluate the expense initially by comparing the ratio of salaries and wages to sales and the percentage of taxes withheld to total salaries, allowances bonuses and other compensation. Low ratios might indicate that the company hires sub-contractors or an understatement of expenses which may be a lead to underdeclared sales. High ratios may also mean an understatement of sales or padded payroll with functions or terminated employees.\n\n3.2 Review payroll sheets. All expenses claimed having the semblance of a compensation payment should be verified together.\n\n3.3 Interview personnel assigned to prepare payroll and inquire if family members are included in the payroll. If so, check legitimacy of the work assignment and reasonableness of compensation paid.\n\n3.4 Compare payroll costs with industry standards and other independent data. Require explanations for significant deviations.\n\n3.5 Observe the actual number of employees and relate this to the declared sales. Inquire if independent contractors are hired in lieu of regular employees.\n\n3.6 Perform a comparative analysis of salaries, wages and other employee benefits with prior and subsequent years. Material changes may indicate a change in the volume of business or in the policy of classifying manpower employed.\n\n3.7 Determine if the taxpayer is properly withholding the correct amount of taxes on compensation by test-checking actual pay slips against employee records and BIR Form 1604 CF (Annual Alpha List of Employees from whom Withholding Tax has been deducted).\n\n3.8 Reconcile totals of wages paid which were subjected to withholding tax and totals of compensation paid which were not subjected to withholding tax with payroll expense claimed. Consider the possibility of disallowing any noted discrepancy in accordance with existing rules and regulations.\n\n3.9 Verify Social Security System Premium Remittance List to cross check the list of employees to whom compensation was paid.\n\n4. Fringe Benefits\n\nFringe benefits tax is a final withholding tax imposed on the grossed-up monetary value of fringe benefits furnished, granted or paid by the employer to the employee, except rank and file employees as defined in Revenue Regulations No. 3-98.\n\n4.1 Obtain a list of managerial and supervisory employees from the Human Resource or Personnel Department of the company being audited with the following information per personnel:\n\na. Nationality\n\nb. Citizenship\n\nc. Number of years with the company\n\nd. Position/Job designation\n\ne. Basic salary and allowances\n\nf. Other compensation and benefits\n\n4.2 Secure copies of employment contracts and/or appointment papers and examine these documents to verify the nature and amount of other compensation, allowances and benefits which may be subject to fringe benefits tax.\n\n4.3 Analyze expenses and other pertinent accounts where fringe benefits may have been lodged or recorded. Determine the amounts of benefits subject to the tax.\n\n4.3.1 Include the value of following items/services as taxable fringe benefits pursuant to Sec. 2.33 (B) of Revenue Regulations No. 3-98:\n\na. Housing\n\nb. Expense Account\n\nc. Vehicle of any kind\n\nd. Household personnel, such as maid, driver and others\n\ne. Interest on loan at less than market rate to the extent of the difference between the market rate and actual rate granted\n\nf. Membership fees, dues and other expenses borne by the employer for the employee in social and athletic clubs or other similar organizations\n\ng. Expenses for foreign travel\n\nh. Holiday and vacation expenses\n\ni. Educational assistance to the employee or his dependents\n\nj. Life or health insurance and other non-life insurance premiums or similar amounts in excess of allowable amount under the law.\n\n4.3.2 Exclude the following fringe benefits from the fringe benefits subject to FBT (Sec. 2.3.3.(c) of RR No. 3-98):\n\na. Fringe benefits which are authorized and exempted from tax under the Tax Code or under any special law\n\nb. Contributions of the employer for the benefit of the employee to retirement, insurance and hospitalization benefit plans\n\nc. Benefits given to the rank and file, whether or not granted under a collective bargaining agreement.\n\nd. De Minimis benefits, such as:\n\nd.1 Monetized unused vacation leave credits of employees not exceeding ten (10) days during the year\n\nd.2 Medical cash allowance to dependents of employees not exceeding P750 per semester or P125 per month\n\nd.3 Rice subsidy of P350 per month granted by an employer to his employees\n\nd.4 Uniforms given to employees by the employer\n\nd.5 Medical benefits given to the employees by the employer\n\nd.6 Laundry allowance of P150 per month\n\nd.7 Employee achievement awards (e.g. for the length of service or safety achievement) which must be in the form of a tangible personal property other than cash or gift certificate, with an annual monetary value not exceeding one-half (\u00bd) month of the basic salary of the employee receiving the award under an established written plan which does not discriminate in favor of highly paid employees\n\nd.8 Christmas and major anniversary celebrations for employees and their guests\n\nd.9 Company picnics and sports tournament in the Philippines and are participated exclusively by employees\n\nd.10 Flowers, fruits, books or similar items given to employees under special circumstances (e.g. on account of illness, marriage, birth of a baby, etc.).\n\ne. If the grant of the fringe benefits is for the convenience of the employer\n\n4.4 Determine the correct valuation of fringe benefits based on the provisions on valuation prescribed and illustrated in RR No. 3-98\n\n4.5 Compute for the amount of taxable fringe benefits by dividing the monetary value of the fringe benefit by the appropriate percentages in accordance with the following schedule:\n\nEffective January 1 ,1998 \u2014 66%\n\nEffective January 1, 1999 \u2014 67%\n\nEffective January 1, 2000 \u2014 68%\n\n4.6 Compute for the correct final withholding tax on fringe benefits by multiplying the grossed-up monetary value of the benefits with the following rates for the applicable taxable years:\n\n1998 \u2014 34%\n\n1999 \u2014 35%\n\n2000 \u2014 32%\n\nThe following are subject to different tax rates as provided by the NIRC and RR No. 3-98:\n\na. A non-resident alien individual not engaged in trade or business within the Philippines (Section 25 (B)) EADCHS\n\nb. An alien individual employed by:\n\nb.1 Regional or area headquarters and regional operating headquarters of multinational corporations (Section 25 (C))\n\nb.2 Offshore banking units (Section 25(1))\n\nb.3 Foreign petroleum service contractor and subcontractors (Section 25 (E))\n\nc. A Filipino citizen employed and occupying the same position as an alien employed by the above-mentioned entities (Section 25 (E))\n\n4.7 Examine monthly final withholding tax returns with corresponding official receipts of payment to check if the correct final withholding tax on fringe benefits was paid. In case of underpayment or late payment, compute the deficiency tax due and/or penalties, where applicable.\n\n4.8 Compare the amount of fringe benefits per income tax return, audited financial statements and per books against the withholding tax returns and official receipts. If the taxpayer is on accrual basis, examine the journal entry made in accruing the expense at the end of the year. Verify if the tax has been paid on or before the due date on the first month of the following year.\n\n4.9 Disallow claims for fringe benefits in excess of supported amounts or where the payees are determined to be fictitious.\n\n5. Rents\n\n5.1 Verify pertinent provisions of the lease contract with the lessor.\n\n5.2 Verify reasonableness of rentals paid by the lessee, particularly if the lessor is related directly to the taxpayer.\n\n5.3 Verify whether the corporation is renting property for which it has no actual business use. Any rentals in that case would be unreasonable and unnecessary; hence, the expense should be disallowed.\n\n5.4 Determine the terms of the lease. If the lessee may take or acquire title to the property, the claim for rental expense should be disallowed.\n\n5.5 Determine if there are any capital expenditures included in the accounts.\n\n5.6 Determine whether the proper amount of expanded withholding tax on rental payments has been withheld and remitted.\n\n6. Royalties\n\n6.1 Verify minute book and pertinent provisions of the contract with the lessor.\n\n6.2 Check correctness of the amount of the expense by computing the percentage of royalty or terms specified in the contract in relation to the reported sales. Disallow excess claim.\n\n6.3 Determine whether the proper amount of final withholding tax has been withheld and remitted.\n\n6.4 If the recipient is a non-resident alien or foreign entity, determine whether the proper amount of tax has been withheld and remitted.\n\n6.4.1 Check whether the recipient is a treaty country resident. If so, ask for a copy of a ruling issued for the use of the preferential tax rate.\n\n6.4.2 If a copy of a ruling has been produced, verify from the issuing office [International Tax Affairs Division (ITAD) or Law Division] for the authenticity of such ruling.\n\n6.4.3 If the recipient is a non-treaty country resident, verify if the appropriate tax rate provided for in the Tax Code is properly applied.\n\n7. Interest\n\n7.1 Verify sources of interest expenses such as actual notes, loans, mortgage or bond instruments. Check whether the indebtedness is business related.\n\n7.2 Determine the accounting method used by the taxpayer. If he uses accrual basis, only the interest accruing during the taxable year is deductible.\n\n7.3 Determine if interest paid or accrued applies to obligations due to related taxpayers. Consider such items as:\n\na. Arm's length features\n\na.1 Bona fide obligations\n\na.2 Interest in excess of the prevailing rates in unrelated transactions.\n\nb. Accrual of items payable to related taxpayers which are not paid within the prescribed time limit.\n\n7.4 Determine if deductions claimed relate to interest incurred in carrying tax free obligations. If so, then the interest claimed is not deductible.\n\n7.5 Disallow interest claimed in excess of interest income subject to final tax.\n\n7.6 Determine if the interest deduction includes any principal amount.\n\n7.7 If the recipient is a non-resident alien or other foreign entity, determine if the proper amount of tax has been withheld (Follow procedures in 6.4 to 6.4.3. hereof).\n\n7.8 Ascertain if the loans acquired were not utilized but were loaned out to affiliates. If so, disallow interest expense claimed.\n\n8. Taxes\n\n8.1 Verify whether only the taxes properly paid or accrued during the year have been claimed.\n\n8.2 Determine that no protested taxes or reserves for deficiency taxes upon audit are claimed.\n\n8.3 Determine existence of claims for taxes not allowable as deduction such as:\n\na. Income tax provided for under the Tax Code;\n\nb. Income, war profits and excess profits taxes imposed by authority of any foreign country;\n\nc. Estate and gift taxes; and\n\nd. Taxes assessed against local benefits of a kind tending to increase the value of the property assessed.\n\n8.4  Determine if the taxpayer has title to the real and personal property being taxed.\n\n8.5 Determine if there are any taxes on the purchase of capital assets that were already capitalized but also charged to expense account.\n\n9. Repairs\n\n9.1 Determine depreciation policy of the taxpayer. A conservative depreciation policy often contemplates a high degree of current repair expenditures.\n\n9.2 Verify nature of expenditures. If the expenditure prolongs the life or enhances the value of the existing assets, then it is not deductible but should be capitalized and depreciated over the years of their estimated usefulness.\n\n9.3 Check repair accounts for the possibility that personal expenses of owners or other company officers and employees are included.\n\n10. Bad Debts\n\n10.1 Obtain and review list of charged-off accounts\n\n10.2 Determine with a reasonable degree of certainty the uncollectibility of the debt.\n\n10.3 Determine if the charge-off is based on worthlessness of the debt within the year.\n\n10.4 Determine if there are repossessed merchandise. If so, verify if the value of repossessed merchandise has been correctly assigned and deducted from the claimed amount of bad debts.\n\n10.5 Verify losses on installment receivable if consideration on any repossessed merchandise had been taken into account and if portion of the losses had been charged to the unrealized gross profit account.\n\n10.6 Determine if the method of deducting bad debts is acceptable and consistent with the method applied in the preceding year.\n\n10.7 Verify bad debts expense in relation to the examination of the allowance for doubtful accounts. SEcAIC\n\n11. Losses\n\n11.1 Abandonment and Demolition Losses\n\n11.1.1 Verify if the amount of the abandonment loss is the adjusted basis of the abandoned asset.\n\n11.1.2 Determine if the loss of missing assets really occurred within the taxable year.\n\n11.1.3 Determine if the retirement or abandonment loss is specifically allowable under the taxpayer's method of accounting for depreciable property.\n\n11.1.4 Determine the reason for the demolition of a building. If it was the taxpayer's intention to demolish the building when the property was first acquired, abandonment loss is not allowable. It should form part of the cost of the building.\n\n11.2 Losses from Casualty or Theft\n\nCasualty loss refers to loss of property connected with trade or business. In the verification of casualty or theft losses, the following pointers should be observed:\n\n11.2.1 Ascertain that a loss has actually been incurred by examining supporting documents such as police report or report of the fire department.\n\n11.2.2 Ascertain that the loss is claimed in the proper year. Generally casualty loss, is claimed in the year incurred while losses from theft or embezzlement is claimed in the year discovered.\n\n11.2.3 Ascertain that insurance proceeds or claims, salvage proceeds, or salvage value have been properly taken into account.\n\n11.2.4 Ascertain that the adjusted basis of lost property has been properly computed. Consider reasonableness of values used in the computation and ascertain that the loss claimed does not exceed the adjusted basis.\n\n11.2.5 Ascertain that the rule as to the manner of deductibility have been complied with (type of asset, whether insured or not, time or period held, and other relevant factors).\n\n11.2.6 In cases involving loss of cash, be alert on the possibility that the cash stolen may not have been included as income.\n\n112.7 Trace handling of losses involving inventory or stock in trade to preclude double claim of deduction.\n\n11.2.8 Analyze any loss claimed for assets located in a foreign country.\n\n11.2.9 Verify police blotters, fire department records and other independent documents in support of the claim.\n\n11.3 Net Operating Loss Carry-over\n\nPursuant to Section 34 (D) (3) of the Tax Code, \"net operating loss\" means the excess of allowable deduction over the gross income of the business in a taxable year.\n\nThe validity of the claim for net operating loss carry-over may be determined through the following procedures:\n\n11.3.1 Secure copies of income tax returns and the applicable audited financial statements for the three (3) consecutive taxable years immediately preceding the year of claim.\n\n11.3.2 Verify audit reports, if any, covering the taxable years with net operating loss to ascertain correctness of amount claimed after audit. If the results of audit for prior years show a net income instead of loss, disallow claim for net operating loss carry-over.\n\n11.3.3 Determine if the net loss was incurred during the taxable year in which the taxpayer was exempt from income tax. If so, the net operating loss carry-over should not be allowed as a deduction for the succeeding period.\n\n11.3.4 Examine the taxpayer's stock and transfer book and report submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission to ascertain that there is no substantial change in the ownership of the business or enterprise in that:\n\na. Not less than seventy five percent (75%) in nominal value of outstanding issued shares, if the business is in the name of a corporation, is held by or on behalf of the same persons; or\n\nb. Not less than seventy five percent (75%) of the paid up capital of the corporation, if the business is in the name of a corporation, is held by or on behalf of the same persons.\n\n11.3.5 For operators of mines, other than oil and gas wells, which did not avail of the incentives under E.O. 226, otherwise known as the Omnibus Incentives Code of 1987, verify correctness of claim for net operating loss:\n\na. Refer to audited financial statements and audit reports to check if the net loss was incurred during the first ten (10) years of operation;\n\nb. Check if the period/taxable year when loss is claimed is within five (5) taxable years following the loss; and\n\nc. Ensure that there is no substantial change in the ownership of the business or enterprise as stated in Section 4 hereof.\n\n12. Depreciation\n\n12.1 Compare total depreciation as shown by the depreciation schedule with the deduction claimed on the return. Reconcile any differences. Be alert for duplication of claimed deductions.\n\n12.2 Review the rates of depreciation used to determine if they are reasonable.\n\n12.3 Test check a representative number of items listed on the depreciation schedule to determine if the accumulated depreciation at the end of the accounting period exceeds the depreciable basis of the asset.\n\n12.4 Test check extensions and prove footings to determine if current depreciation has been correctly computed.\n\n12.5 Determine if there is any personal use of cars and other depreciable assets.\n\n12.6 Ascertain if proper cost allocation has been made on bulk purchases of depreciable and non-depreciable assets.\n\n13. Depletion\n\n13.1 Determine if the taxpayer has an economic interest in the property.\n\n13.2 Determine if the taxpayer has acquired, at least by investment, any interest in oil, gas or mineral in a place, and secures, by any form of legal relationship, any income derived from the extraction of oil, gas or mineral.\n\n13.3 The following additional guidelines should be followed in the verification of the deduction for depletion:\n\n13.3.1 Ascertain that the sales reported in relation to a property do not include sales applicable to another property, sales of purchased minerals, non-minerals sales or other income items.\n\n13.3.2 Ascertain, where applicable, if mineral sales have been adjusted to \"gross income from the property\" by reduction of such factors as unallowable treatment cost, unallowable transportation costs, rents and royalties, including a proportionate part of lease bonuses, amounts paid to others in contract mining or similar operations where the other party has acquired an economic interest and is entitled to depletion, certain excise taxes, trade discounts allowed and other deductions. CSAcTa\n\n13.3.3 In situations where the basis for percentage of depletion is not the actual sales price of a finished product but a value of the mineral at the point at which it has passed through the last allowable treatment process applicable thereto, determine if the value used is the correct representative market or field price.\n\n13.3.4 Ascertain that mineral sales made to a business controlled by the taxpayer are not inflated to gain a tax advantage through depletion.\n\n13.3.5 Ascertain that all expenses applicable to a property have been charged to that property including a proper allocation of general, administrative and overhead expenses.\n\n13.3.6 Be alert on possible reduction of expenses by improper offsets such as income from scrap sales, cash discounts earned, sales of assets, and other income.\n\n14. Contributions\n\n14.1 Determine if the donee or recipient is the government or an accredited relief organization.\n\n14.2 Determine if the contribution is to be utilized for the rehabilitation of calamity stricken areas declared by the President.\n\n14.3 Verify if the claim is actually paid within the taxable year.\n\n15. Transportation and Travel, Representation and Entertainment\n\n15.1 Determine if the expenditures have been incurred in relation to the business or practice of profession, not for personal use.\n\n15.2 For transportation and travel expenses, the following information are necessary to properly determine deductibility:\n\na. Date of travel\n\nb. Purpose of the travel and written authority for the travel\n\nc. The person or persons who incurred the expenditure\n\nd. Place or places travelled\n\ne. Amount of expenditure\n\nf. Means of transportation or travel\n\n15.3 Determine if taxpayer's travel and transportation and representation and entertainment expenses are recorded in a daily diary. If such expenses appear to be disproportionate to the taxpayer's income and business activities, the taxpayer should be required to corroborate the book entries by furnishing documentary proofs.\n\n15.4 Determine the policy with respect to reimbursement or giving grants of allowances to employees.\n\n15.5 Ascertain the specific amounts recorded for these items.\n\n15.6 Prepare a summary of the total expenses posted to the accounts and compare the same with the deductions claimed per tax return.\n\n15.7 Select a representative test period or periods and test check entries in the ledger against supporting receipts and documents.\n\n15.8 Determine from the analysis and verification of supporting documents the reliability of the records.\n\n15.9 Determine company-owned vehicles and the expenses incurred in connection with these vehicles.\n\n16. Stationery and Office Supplies\n\n16.1 Determine if the expenses claimed are not capitalizable office furniture and equipment.\n\n16.2 Verify if personal purchases by the taxpayer/owner are included in the account.\n\n16.3 Determine the reasonableness of the expenditures.\n\n16.4 Compare receipts with the amounts claimed and investigate significant discrepancies.\n\n17. Professional Fees\n\n17.1 Determine if the charges include amounts incurred for legal, accounting, engineering, appraisal, surveying and other similar services.\n\n17.2 Verify if the amounts are material and examine contracts to check the detailed description of the exact professional services rendered.\n\n17.3 Check legal expenses or representation expenses as it might at times be political contributions, bribes or kickbacks, which should be disallowed.\n\n17.4 Determine charges for research and experimental expenses. These items should form part of the cost of patents, trade-marks and copyrights and other intangible assets subject to amortization.\n\n18. Insurance Expenses\n\n18.1 Verify insurance policies. Premiums paid by employers on individual life insurance policies of their employees are not deductible if the employer is a direct or indirect beneficiary of such proceeds.\n\n18.2 For individuals, ascertain if his claim for insurance premiums on health and/or hospitalization insurance, including for his family, does not exceed two thousand four hundred pesos (P2,400) during the taxable year, provided that:\n\na. In case of married individuals, the combined income of the taxpayer and his spouse does not exceed two hundred fifty thousand pesos (P250,000) during the same taxable year; and\n\nb. Only the spouse claiming the additional exemption for dependents shall be entitled to this deduction.\n\n18.3 Determine if the employee is the beneficiary of the insurance. Otherwise, the premiums paid shall be treated as an additional salary provided that it is reasonable.\n\n18.4 Check the account if it includes fire insurance, burglary insurance and other policies on officer's/stockholder's personal and real properties.\n\n19. Light and Power, Telephone and Telegraph\n\n19.1 Determine material amounts claimed as it may include capitalizable electrical equipment or purchases of capital items from utility companies.\n\n19.2 Examine the receipts issued by the utility companies. Compare the same with the amounts claimed per return. Investigate material discrepancies.\n\n19.3 Determine if there are personal expenses included in the expense account.\n\n19.4 Relate the expense consumption against sales and production to determine any possible underdeclaration of sales.\n\n20. Miscellaneous Expenses\n\n20.1 Check the validity of the individual charges to the account.\n\n20.2 Determine if deductions claimed are adequately substantiated.\n\n20.3 Ascertain if the miscellaneous expenses claimed do not contain any personal items.\n\nXI. Audit of Minimum Corporate Income Tax and Improperly Accumulated Earnings Tax\n\nA. Minimum Corporate Income Tax\n\nPursuant to Section 27 (E)(1) of the Tax Code, a minimum corporate income tax (MCIT) of two percent (2%) of the gross income as of the end of the taxable year is imposed on a corporation taxable under Title II of the Tax Code, beginning on the fourth taxable year immediately following the year in which such corporation commenced its business operations, when the minimum income tax is greater than the tax computed under Section 27 (A) of the Tax Code. Any excess of the minimum corporate income over the normal income tax shall be carried forward and credited against the normal income tax for the three (3) immediately succeeding taxable years.\n\nThe verification of the minimum corporate income tax may be conducted as follows:\n\n1. Determine the taxability of the taxpayer to the MCIT. The MCIT shall apply to domestic and resident foreign corporations subject to the normal corporate income tax and shall not be imposed upon any of the following:\n\n1.1 Domestic corporations operating as proprietary educational institutions subject to ten percent (10%) income tax rate;\n\n1.2 Domestic corporations engaged in non-profit hospital operations subject to ten percent (10%) income tax rate; DCHaTc\n\n1.3 Domestic corporations engaged in business as depository banks under the expanded foreign currency deposit system, otherwise known a Foreign Currency Deposit Units (FCDUs), on their income from foreign currency transactions with local commercial banks, including branches of foreign banks, authorized by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) to transact business with foreign currency deposit system units and other depository banks under the foreign currency deposit system, including their interest income from foreign currency loans granted to residents of the Philippines under the expanded foreign currency deposit system, subject to final income tax at ten percent (10%) of such income;\n\n1.4 Resident foreign corporations engaged in business as international carrier subject to 2\u00bd% income tax on the \"Gross Philippine Billings\";\n\n1.5 Resident foreign corporations engaged in business as Offshore Banking Units (OBUs) on their income from foreign currency transactions with local commercial banks, including branches of foreign banks, authorized by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) to transact business with Offshore Banking Units (OBUs), including interest income from foreign currency loans granted to residents of the Philippines, subject to a final income tax at ten percent (10%) of such income;\n\n1.6 Resident foreign corporations engaged in business as regional operating headquarters subject to ten percent (10%) tax on their taxable income; and\n\n1.7 Firms that are taxed under a special income tax regime such as those in accordance with RA Nos. 7916 and 7227.\n\n2. Determine the gross income subject to MCIT.\n\n2.1 Check the accuracy of the declaration of gross sales/receipts contributing to income taxable under Section 27 (A) of the Code.\n\n2.1.1 Ascertain the accounting method employed by the taxpayer and verify consistency in its application. In case of sales of services by taxpayers employing the accrual basis of accounting, the term \"gross receipts\" shall mean amounts earned as gross income and these shall include amounts actually or constructively received during the taxable year.\n\n2.1.2 Exclude items of sale specifically exempt from income tax, and those passive income subject to special tax rates.\n\n2.1.3 Ascertain legitimacy of deductions from gross sales such as sales returns, discounts and allowances.\n\n2.2 Verify correctness of the claim for cost of goods sold. Ensure that only business expenses directly incurred to produce the merchandise to bring them to their present location and use or to provide the contracted services are included in this account.\n\na. For trading or merchandising concern, \"cost of goods sold\" means the invoice cost of the goods sold, plus import duties, freight in transporting the goods to the place where the goods are actually sold, including insurance while the goods are in transit.\n\nb. For manufacturing concern, \"cost of goods manufactured and sold\" means all costs of production of finished goods, such as raw materials used, direct labor and manufacturing overhead, freight cost, insurance premiums and other costs incurred to bring the raw materials to the factory or warehouse.\n\nc. For sales of services, \"cost of services\" means all direct costs and expenses necessarily incurred to provide the services required by the customers and client including (1) salaries and employee benefits of personnel, consultants and specialists directly rendering the service; and (2) cost of facilities directly utilized in providing the service such as depreciation or rental of equipment used and cost of supplies.\n\nExcept for banks and other financial institutions, cost of sales/services shall not include interest expense.\n\n3. Determine the period when the taxpayer becomes subject to the minimum corporate income tax.\n\n3.2 Verify the year of taxpayer's registration with the BIR to ascertain whether or not it is subject to MCIT:\n\na. Firms registered with BIR in 1994 and earlier years are covered by the MCIT beginning January 1, 1998.\n\nb. Firms registered with BIR in any month in 1998 are covered three calendar years thereafter.\n\nFor fiscal period taxpayer, taxable year 1998 shall mean any fiscal period ending any day from July 1, 1997 up to June 30, 1998.\n\n3.3 Ascertain whether the first taxable period under the MCIT of the taxpayer using fiscal-year accounting covers month/months in 1997 prior to the imposition of MCIT. Be sure that the computed MCIT due for 1998 using the apportionment formula is correct.\n\n4. Verify if the taxpayer is entitled to the relief from the imposition of the MCIT and secure documentary proof for the suspension of its imposition as approved by the Secretary of Finance.\n\n5. Check accuracy of the amount of excess MCIT carried over and credited against the normal tax within the three (3) immediately succeeding years from payment thereof, if any. See to it that any excess MCIT are not claimed against MCIT itself or against any other losses.\n\nB. Improperly Accumulated Earnings Tax\n\nIn accordance with Section 29 (A) of the Tax Code, an improperly accumulated earnings tax equal to ten percent (10%) of the improperly accumulated taxable income is imposed for each taxable year on the improperly accumulated taxable income of each corporation identified under Section 27 (B) of the Tax Code.\n\nThe improperly accumulated earnings tax shall be determined as follows:\n\n1. Ascertain the classification of the corporation and the business it is engaged in to determine whether the imposition of the improperly accumulated earnings tax shall apply. For this purpose, the fact that the corporation is a mere holding company or investment company is considered a prima facie evidence of a purpose to avoid the tax upon its shareholders or members; hence, the 10% tax will automatically apply. However, the following corporations are not subject to the improperly accumulated earnings tax:\n\n1.1 Publicly-held corporations;\n\n1.2 Banks and other non-bank financial intermediaries; and\n\n1.3 Insurance companies.\n\n2. Determine the reasonableness of the accumulation of profits or earnings and if the same is required for the purposes of the business, considering all the circumstances of the case.\n\n2.1 Look into the following factors to ascertain if the accumulated profits are reasonably needed in the business:\n\na. Nature of the company's business;\n\nb. Financial condition of the corporation at the close of the taxable year;\n\nc. The dividend distribution history of the corporation;\n\nd. The stock of the corporation is widely held in small blocks,\n\ne. The use of the undistributed profits or earnings;\n\nf. Retention of cash, securities and other assets unrelated to the business operations;\n\ng. Advances or loss to stockholders, whether or not interest shall be paid;\n\nh. Dealings between the corporation and its stockholders, such as withdrawals by the shareholders as personal loans or the expenditure of funds by the corporation for the personal benefit of the shareholders;\n\ni. The investment by the corporation of undistributed earnings in assets having no reasonable connection with the business;\n\nj. The need for business expansion;\n\nk. The earnings and expansion history of the taxpayer;\n\nl. Past savings effected by non-distribution of profits to stockholders;\n\nm. Past tax avoidance history of the corporation;\n\nn. Portion of shareholder's assets transferred to the corporation;\n\no. Sudden shift in corporate or dividend policy of the company;\n\np. The percentage of income distributed to shareholders during the taxable year; and\n\nq. Retirement of stocks, this being a capital transaction and should result in reduction of capital instead of reduction of earnings and profits.\n\n2.7 Secure copies of the board resolutions and verify therefrom any existence of undue accumulation of profits, correlating the findings with the plans per resolution as against the business activities and dealings made by the corporation.\n\n2.3 Require the taxpayer to submit documentary proof negating the clear preponderance of evidence that the profits were permitted to accumulate beyond the reasonable needs of the company's business. The accumulation of surplus for the reasonable needs of the business is not prevented if the purpose is not to prevent the imposition of the tax upon the shareholders. Undistributed income may be considered as properly accumulated in the following cases:\n\na. The profit is retained for working capital needed by the business;\n\nb. The profit is invested in additions to plants, facilities and activities reasonably required by the business provided that the plans for expansion or improvement must be definite, concrete and capable of fulfillment and not what may be characterized as nebulous plans for future action.\n\nc. The accumulation of earnings is in accordance with contract obligations placed to the credit of a sinking fund for the purpose of retiring bonds.\n\nd. The profit is intended as reserves to meet competition, for anticipated losses or reverses in business, and to meet business hazards and emergencies.\n\n2.4 Verify whether the company's increase in capitalization, if any, is necessary in the light of the existing circumstances surrounding the business. Ascertain whether declaration of stock dividends from increased corporate capital was made to go around the surtax since stock dividends are not taxable unless there is a change of interest, or unless they are disposed of by the holders or redeemed by the additional tax if the aforementioned scheme was clearly established.\n\n3. Determine the amount of improperly accumulated taxable income subject to the surtax.\n\n3.1 Account for all the company's income during the year.\n\n3.2. Determine all the appropriate adjustments to the improperly accumulated taxable income. For purposes of imposing the tax, the taxable income shall be adjusted by the following items:\n\na. Income exempt from tax; STDEcA\n\nb. Income excluded from gross income;\n\nc. Income subject to final tax; and\n\nd. Amount of net operating loss carry-over deducted.\n\n3.3 Deduct dividends actually or constructively paid and income tax paid for the taxable year from the adjusted taxable income.\n\n3.4 Exclude the improperly accumulated income as of December 31, 1997 in the computation of accumulated taxable income subject to tax. The surtax shall likewise not apply to fiscal-period taxpayers where the twelve (12) month period ended any day from January up to November 1998.\n\nCompute the 10% surtax based on the adjusted improperly accumulated taxable income. The computation of the surtax shall be made on a year-to-year basis depending on the thorough evaluation of the circumstances proving that the company has indeed permitted itself to accumulate earnings or profits beyond the reasonable needs of the business.\n\nXII. Auditing Computer-Produced Records\n\nA. Impact of Computer Records on Audit\n\nThe use of computers to process accounting data has a significant effect on the audit skills of the Revenue Officer. The ability to understand and evaluate the taxpayer's information technology (IT) is important. The Revenue Officer must understand the flow of accounting data or audit trails on a computerized system to conduct a quality audit.\n\nB. Accounting Software Systems\n\nAuditing computer records require basic techniques used in auditing manual books and records. There is still a need to:\n\na. Perform an effective preliminary analysis of the return;\n\nb. Interview the taxpayer;\n\nc. Tour the business premises;\n\nd. Evaluate internal controls;\n\ne. Reconcile the information reflected in the books, financial statements and the tax returns;\n\nf. Re-evaluate your previous analysis of the return;\n\ng. Set the scope of the audit;\n\nh. Test the amounts you have identified as questionable;\n\ni. Ask questions about the data you have examined;\n\nj. Evaluate auditor's adjustments; and\n\nk. Apply sound accounting principles, relevant provisions of the Tax Code and existing revenue issuances to reach the proper conclusion regarding the data examined.\n\nAs part of the initial interview, the Revenue Officer should ask questions to achieve a clear understanding of the taxpayer's books and records, such as:\n\na. Find out what type of system software is being utilized.\n\nb. Determine who authorizes the debit and credit of certain accounts and write-off of certain transactions.\n\nc. Determine who encodes the accounting transactions. If the same person enters both the payables and the receivables, there is no segregation of functions. This would allow one person to perpetuate or conceal errors by controlling the offsetting of debits and credits.\n\nd. Find out what reports are generated and how often these are generated. Identify management reports which may be utilized to disclose audit findings.\n\nIn addition to asking the taxpayer about the particular information system, the Revenue Officer must study the software manual. The manual will tell how the system works and the types of reports available. The Revenue Officer shall determine the reasonable time to be spent in reviewing the software capabilities.\n\nC. Audit Techniques For Computer \u2014 Produced Records\n\nThe traditional audit approach to audit double-entry books and records is to scan through the general ledger and note any unusual entries. The purpose of this scanning is to identify entries in the computerized general ledger which are unusual due to the amount, source or nature.\n\n1. Unusual in Amount\n\nThe basic technique for identifying large charges or variations to accounts in a computerized system consists of securing the monthly statements. Usually, these will be retained by the taxpayer. The monthly balances are reviewed for changes. Changes in the monthly account balances are then explored by reviewing the monthly detail and scanning the check register. The Revenue Officer must consider if the charge or variation could be expected, is reasonable and in the expected direction, and is material enough to warrant investigation. For example, if monthly trial balances showed rent expense of P500 and one month showed P1,500, you would ask the taxpayer about the P1,500 rent expense.\n\n2. Unusual by Source\n\nThe basic technique for detecting entries to accounts from unusual sources consists of comparing monthly posting summaries from each source with the chart of accounts. A computerized system will utilize monthly posting summaries. These summaries will show monthly changes to an account, most often by account number and originating journal. By comparing the accounts which show monthly changes with the chart of accounts, posting to unusual accounts can be detected. Scan the accounts payable listings for vendors that appear personal in nature.\n\n3. Unusual by Nature\n\nThe basic technique for detecting entries to accounts, which are unusual by nature, involves the same process as shown for detecting entries from unusual sources. You are looking for debit posting to accounts which normally contain only credit posting and vice versa. An example would be a debit to a sales account, which could be a bad debt written-off. Accounts which exist at the beginning of the year and not at the end might indicate unauthorized accounting changes.\n\nXIII. Indirect Approach to Investigation\n\nReconstruction of income is generally employed where the taxpayer keeps no record or inadequate records, or where there is strong suspicion that the taxpayer has received income from undisclosed sources.\n\nOver the years, the Bureau of Internal Revenue has developed the following general methods for reconstructing a taxpayer's income.\n\nA. Percentage method\n\nB. Net worth method\n\nC. Bank deposits method\n\nD. Cash expenditure method\n\nE. Unit and value method\n\nF. Third party information or access to records method\n\nG. Surveillance and assessment method\n\nA. Percentage Method\n\nThis method is the equivalent of a ratio analysis of percentages considered typical of the business under investigation to indicate potential areas of revenue adjustment in examination where revenue records do not exist. The computed amount of revenues based on the percentage computation is compared to the amount of revenues reflected on the return. The percentages used may be obtained from the taxpayer, industry publication, prior year's audit results, or third parties. The comparison will provide an indication on the possibility of revenue being understated. The extent of investigation required should be based on the degree of variance.\n\nIt must, however, be emphasized that in comparing transactions of similarly situated businesses, the name of the particular taxpayer used as the model must not be divulged to the taxpayer under investigation or in the report as this would constitute a violation by an internal Revenue Officer of the provisions of Section 270, National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) on unlawful divulgence of trade secrets. aDCIHE\n\nSignificant ratios and trends to be analyzed are as follows:\n\n1. Percentage Mark-up\n\nThis is effective on businesses whose purchases can be readily broken down in groups with approximately the same percentage of mark-up.\n\nThe purchases should be grouped in items with the same percentage of mark-up. The appropriate percentage of mark-up would then be applied to each group of items to arrive at the gross receipts.\n\nThe percentage of mark-up can be determined from selling prices obtained from the taxpayer. However, if cooperation from the taxpayer is lacking, the information should be obtained from competitive business establishments in the same industry.\n\nOnce the gross receipts are determined, the taxpayer should be given the opportunity to explain the discrepancy noted between the reconstructed gross receipts and the amounts reflected in the books and in the tax returns. The taxpayer may argue that the percentage mark-up should not be applied to purchases which were stolen, broken or spoiled.\n\nWhen reconstructing income using the mark-up method, possible unrecorded purchases should be considered.\n\n2. Gross Profit Ratio or Gross Margin Percentage\n\nThe gross profit is expressed as a percentage of sales.\n\nGross Profit Ratio =\n\n(Sales-Cost Of Goods Sold)\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nSales\n\nNote: Sales should be net of Sales Discounts, Returns and Allowances.\n\nComparison should be made with prior period ratios to evaluate the taxpayer's own performance in previous years or with other firms in the same industry.\n\n3. Profit Margin\n\nNet Income\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 = Profit Margin\n\nNet Sales\n\nIf the profit margin is low, this will indicate that the firm's sales prices are relatively low or that its costs are relatively high or both.\n\n4. Total Assets Turnover\n\nSales\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nTotal Assets\n\n= Total Assets Turnover\n\nA high rate compared to the industry would signify sufficient volume of business and if a net loss is declared, questions must be raised or further investigation and analysis should be performed.\n\ne. Inventory Turnover\n\nThe inventory turnover is computed as follows:\n\nInventory turnover=\n\nSales\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nTotal Assets\n\nor\n\nCost of Sales\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nBeg. Invty. + End Invty./2\n\nIf the turnover is low, the company could be holding damaged or obsolete materials not actually worth their stated volume.\n\nAverage inventory at a given point X turnover rate = total purchases during the year.\n\nB. Net Worth Method\n\nThe fact that the taxpayer's books and records accurately reflect the figures on the income and business tax returns does not prevent the use of the net worth method of proof. The Revenue Officer can still look beyond the \"self-serving declaration\" in the taxpayer's books and records and use any evidences available to contravene their accuracy. However, this net worth method is most often used when one or more of the following conditions prevail:\n\n1. The taxpayer maintains no books and records.\n\n2. The taxpayer's books and records are not available.\n\n3. The taxpayer's books and records are inadequate.\n\n4. The taxpayer withholds books and records from investigation/verification by authorized Revenue Officer(s).\n\nThis is a method of reconstructing income which is based on the theory that if the taxpayer's net worth has increased in a given year in an amount larger than his reported income, he had understated his income for that year.\n\nIn applying this method, it is important to establish the net worth on a fixed starting date. This is to erase doubts that the increase in net worth or the excess of expenditures over reported income did not originate from prior accumulated funds (i.e. hoarded cash or undisclosed assets which do not represent income during the tax year).\n\nThe \"Net Worth\" method to be acceptable must establish with reasonable certainty an opening net worth, to serve as a starting point from which to compute future increases in the taxpayer's assets. It must also introduce evidence to support the inference that the taxpayer's net increases are attributable to currently taxable income.\n\nIn computing the increase, the taxpayer's assets are totalled and net worth as determined at the close of the previous taxable year is subtracted from the total at the close of the taxable year in question. The remainder, if .any, is the increase for the taxable year, and constitutes taxable income if no adjustments are required.\n\nHowever, where net worth increase is the income determinant the Revenue Officer may, in making the final computation upon which to base the tax, add to the increase estimated living expenses incurred by the taxpayer since such expenditures are presumed to have come from income. The taxpayer, on the other hand, is entitled to reduce the reconstructed income by the amount of depreciation allowable on assets which are not considered in determining net worth.\n\nThe factors to be considered in reconstructing net worth are variable, like availability of evidence. Generally, net worth has been computed on the basis of some, all or a combination of the following:\n\na. bank records\n\nb. securities\n\nc. financial statements\n\nd. fixed assets\n\ne. inventory\n\nf. all available records\n\n3. Determination of Opening/Net Worth: The COHAN Rule\n\nThe difficulty of establishing the opening net worth of a taxpayer has led to the use of the Cohan rule to estimate or approximate the amount of cash at that time. The Cohan rule (established by the US Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals in Cohan vs. Commissioner) allows the use of estimates where the taxpayer lacks adequate records.\n\nC. Bank Deposit Method\n\nWhen the taxpayer's records are apparently inaccurate or manifestly incomplete, the Revenue Officer may look at the bank deposits of the taxpayer as evidence income. Under the bank deposit method, the bank records of the taxpayer are analyzed and the Revenue Officer estimates income on the basis of the total bank deposits after eliminating non-income items. This method stands on the premise that deposits represent taxable income unless otherwise explained as being-non-taxable items. This method can be used if the Revenue Officer has been allowed access to the taxpayer's bank records or if the Revenue Officer has obtained documented evidence from reliable sources as to the taxpayer's bank accounts. cSATEH\n\nWhile the mere deposit of money does not prove the receipt of taxable income as alleged by the Revenue Officer, the burden is on the taxpayer to prove that various deposits did not stem from the receipt of taxable income. The passage of time makes it difficult for the taxpayer to meet this burden but this does not relieve him from showing the non-taxable source to contradict the Revenue Officer's determination. If the bank deposit method is used in support of findings of fraud, however, the burden of proof is on the Revenue Officer.\n\nWhen computing taxable income under this method, it is appropriate to add to the amount of the bank deposit the amount of cash expenditures from undeposited funds for personal expenses which is non-deductible for tax purposes. Withdrawals which can be identified as deductible are allowed against the taxable income determined.\n\nIn using this method, it is proper to prove the existence of a business and the practice of making deposit of business income into one or more bank accounts and then to adjust the total deposits for transfers, redeposits, deposits otherwise explained and finally to allow for ascertainable expenses, deductions and exemptions.\n\n1. Analysis of Bank Deposits\n\nThe Revenue Officer's careful analysis of the taxpayer's bank deposits constitutes the most important phase of his investigation. A review of the taxpayer's personal and business bank records for several months should be made. The following questions should be answered in analyzing the taxpayer's deposits:\n\n1.1 Are deposits made on a basis consistent with the information secured during the initial interview?\n\n1.2 Are there any large or unusual deposits?\n\n1.3 Are there any deposits from sources not reflected on the tax return?\n\n1.4 Did the examination of the taxpayer's cancelled checks reveal additional bank accounts not previously disclosed by the taxpayer?\n\n1.5 Are there checks endorsed by the taxpayer and deposited into an account not previously disclosed?\n\n1.6 Are there checks for assets or personal expenses that affect the taxpayer's standard of living?\n\n2. Computation of Gross Receipts Through Bank Deposit Method\n\nDeposits may represent redeposited items and loans, in which case, taxable income as determined by the Revenue Officer should be reduced by such amounts. When there is evidence that some of the deposits were for non-taxable items and as such, there is no proof of the precise amount of taxable income, the Cohan principle may be resorted to. Deposits may also be shown to represent amounts on hand at the start of the year in which they are deposited rather than income in that year.\n\nThe bank deposit method, like the net worth method, encompasses an area of uncertainty. Though the taxpayer's records are inadequate for precise and complete verification of its return, a determination of income by the bank deposit method will be rejected if it is inconsistent with surrounding circumstances and gives an absurd result.\n\nD. Cash Expenditure Method\n\nAn outgrowth of the net worth method of determining income is the \"excess cash expenditure method. This method assumes that the excess of a taxpayer's expenditures during a tax period over his reported income for that period is taxable to the extent not approved otherwise. The taxpayer may show that this excess resulted from non-taxable items such as loans, gifts, inheritance or assets on hand at the beginning of the period.\n\nWhile it has been said that no opening net worth is needed when the cash expenditure method is used, the more impressive authority is to the contrary. The two steps involved in the cash expenditure method are: a) valuation of the taxpayer's assets at the beginning of the taxable period in order to determine the taxpayer's funds available for expenditure during the ensuing taxable periods and b) determination of the amount by which expenditures exceed reported income for the taxable period. To show a failure to report the full amount of income by the use of this method, it must be demonstrated that the expenditures made during the taxable year were in excess of the available funds during the year which were reported on the tax return.\n\nTotal expenditures may not include checks drawn to cash and items for which the taxpayer has paid in cash, unless the cash bank withdrawals were not used to pay for the cash expenditure. The burden is on the taxpayer to establish the relationship between the cash withdrawal and individual items. Expenditures may not necessarily come from income, but very large expenditures for personal purposes each year may be interpreted as an indication that the income being reported was too small.\n\nConsideration must be given to non-taxable sources of cash. Here, too, the difficulty of establishing the amount of cash at the starting point has led to the use of Cohan rule to estimate the cash available at the opening of the taxable period. The method has to be rejected when it gives an unrealistic result.\n\nProof in cash expenditure case may be difficult, for it is highly unusual for anyone to keep accurate records of personal living expenses. However, once the Revenue Officer has made a determination as to the amount of cash expenditures, the burden of proof to establish a different amount is on the taxpayer.\n\nE. Cash Expenditure Method\n\nThis is not considered as a primary method proof. The determination or verification of gross receipts may be computed by applying price and profit figures to the known ascertainable quality of business of the taxpayer. In addition, there are existing regulatory bodies to which the taxpayer reports units of production or service, some of which are:\n\na. records of sugar milled by a sugar central\n\nb. records of fish production to the Bureau of Fishery and Aquatic Resources\n\nc. records of production by pioneer and non-pioneer industries to the Board of Investments.\n\nE.1. Examples Using Unit and Value Method\n\nF. Third Party Information (Access to Records) Method\n\nThird party contacts are a source of information that should not be forgotten. The Revenue Officer should determine when to make third party inquiries. The decision to make a third party inquiry is shaped by the size of the peso amount involved and the volume of the transaction. Third party inquiry through access to records can be time consuming. The Revenue Officer must weigh the benefits to be realized from work against the time required to make an access to records and the availability of the needed information through other methods. The need for the Revenue Officer to obtain third party information is most often involved in our attempts to verify gross receipts.\n\nXIV. Audit Procedures on Other Kinds of Taxes\n\nA. Withholding Taxes\n\nThe following audit procedures outline the steps to be performed by a Revenue Officer in the determination of the correct amount of withholding taxes due from withholding agents to ascertain if:\n\n1. The income payments were subjected to withholding taxes.\n\n2. The rate of tax and the amount of tax withheld is correct.\n\n3. The tax withheld is remitted within the due dates.\n\nThe audit procedures are classified according to the classification of withholding taxes, to wit:\n\n1. Withholding Tax on Compensation\n\n2. Expanded Withholding Tax\n\n3. Final Withholding Tax\n\n4. Withholding Tax on Government Money Payments\n\nAudit procedures for the different kinds of withholding taxes.\n\n1. Withholding Tax on Compensation\n\n1.1 Verify the number and list of employees per payroll records and the list of employees submitted to the Social Security System and the Department of Labor and Employment as against the alphalist of employees from whom taxes have been withheld which is attached to the annual information return (BIR Form 1604CF).\n\n1.2 Examine payroll records. including confidential payroll, if any, employment contracts, supporting vouchers, receipts for advances/reimbursements of transportation and representation expenses, receipts for payment of compensation and reconcile amount of supported expenses with the figures per financial statements and withholding tax remittance returns.\n\n1.3 Determine the correctness of the amount of personal and additional exemptions claimed in the Certificate of Exemption (BIR Form 2305) as accomplished and filed by the employee. Check the computation of the correct withholding tax per payroll period.\n\n1.4 Examine monthly withholding tax remittance returns (BIR Form 1601C) and compare amounts remitted against the computed withholding tax on compensation per audit.\n\n1.5 Reconcile the aggregate gross compensation income stated in the withholding certificate (BIR Form 2316) with the total amount indicated in the gross compensation income column of the alphalist.\n\n2. Expanded Withholding Tax\n\n2.1 Check amount payable or paid per income statement and income tax returns (BIR Forms 1701 and 1701Q) against those declared in the monthly and annual returns (BIR Forms 1601E and 1604E).\n\n2.2. Ascertain validity of payments by and to prime contractors, and subcontractors, professionals, brokers, sub-brokers, agents of entertainers, etc. by examining contracts, subcontracts, vouchers, receipts and billings.\n\n2.3 Determine the correctness of the amounts subject to withholding tax by comparing the total payments per supporting documents against the amount per withholding tax returns.\n\n2.3 Verify the correctness of the payee classification and withholding tax rate applied.\n\n2.5 Determine the dates of payment or the period when the obligation to pay the amount subject to withholding tax is due. The time to withhold is fixed at the time the obligation is due irrespective of the actual payment. SHacCD\n\n3. Final Withholding Taxes\n\n3.1 Review the contracts for payment of certain items of income to resident and non-resident payees of interest and rent, Central Bank approval papers, commercial papers, employment contracts, contract for payment of royalties, records of prizes or winnings and financial statements.\n\n3.2 Ascertain if the income payment was subjected to withholding tax in the year it was accrued, irrespective of whether the taxes withheld were remitted within ten (10) days following the month in which the payment was accrued. In the case of withholding tax on interest on bank deposits, the remittance shall be made quarterly within twenty five (25) days after the end of each quarter.\n\n3.3 Check the correctness of the basis and rate of withholding tax applied.\n\n3.3.1 If a preferential tax rate is being availed of, verify the correctness of the rate used from the ruling issued either by the International Tax Affairs Division (ITAD) or Law Division. Also verify the authenticity of said ruling from the issuing office.\n\n3.4 Ascertain the date of accrual of the income payment, to fix the time to withhold, irrespective of the actual remittance or non-remittance of the tax withheld by reason of official restriction.\n\n3.5 Verify correctness of remittance against monthly remittance returns (BIR Form 1601F) and annual information return (BIR Form 1604CF).\n\n4. Withholding Tax on Government Money Payments\n\n4.1 Examine government contracts with suppliers, purchase records, payment orders, billing records, receipts, vouchers, cash book and reports of COA auditors.\n\n4.2 Check money payments from vouchers, billing records, records of purchases, COA audit reports, etc. against monthly remittance returns (BIR Form 1600), books of accounts and other accounting records maintained.\n\n4.3 Determine the correctness of bases and rates of tax applied.\n\n4.4 Check whether the correct amount of tax has been withheld and remitted within the prescribed period. Otherwise, impose appropriate penalties for non-withholding or non-remittance of the tax, as the case may be.\n\nB. Be Capital Gains Tax on Sale, Transfer or Exchange of Real Property\n\nThis Section equips the Revenue Officer with minimum audit steps prescribed by existing revenue issuances in the proper determination of the correct capital gains tax due on sale, transfer or exchange of real properties. Additional audit techniques must be employed by the Revenue Officer depending on the complexity and materiality of the transactions involved.\n\n1. Ascertain authenticity of the following documents:\n\n1.1 Deed of Sale/Transfer or Exchange\n\n1.2 Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT)/Condominium Certificate Title (CCT)/Original Certificate of Title (OCT)\n\n1.3 Latest Tax Declaration\n\n2. If the object of the sale or disposition is the principal residence of natural persons, verify the following:\n\n1.4 Whether the proceeds of the sale or disposition was fully utilized in acquiring or constructing a new principal residence of the seller; and\n\n2.2 Whether such construction or acquisition of such new principal residence is within eighteen (18) months from date of sale or disposition.\n\nIf both are in the affirmative, the sale or disposition shall be exempt from capital gains tax, subject to the following conditions:\n\n2.2.1 The historical cost or adjusted basis of the real property sold or disposed shall be carried over to the new principal residence built;\n\n2.2.2 The Commissioner shall have been duly notified by the - taxpayer within thirty (30) days from the date of disposition through a prescribed return of his intention to avail of the exemption;\n\n2.2.3 The exemption from capital gains tax shall be availed of only once in every ten (10) years; and\n\n2.2.4 In case where the proceeds of the sale or disposition is not fully utilized, the portion for the unutilized part shall be subjected to tax using the formula:\n\nGross Selling Price or Fair Market Value\n\n(whichever is higher) x Unutilized\n\nAmount\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 X 6%\n\nGross Selling Price\n\n3. For disposition of real property without any improvement, obtain a certificate from the City/Provincial/Municipal Assessor on the non-existence of improvement on the real property being sold, transferred or exchanged.\n\n4. Ascertain correctness of the value of the property sold by conducting an ocular inspection of the property.\n\n5. If the seller is a non-resident alien claiming exemption from paying the capital gains tax, check the existence of a ruling issued to that effect pursuant to RMO 1-2000. Also verify the authenticity of said ruling from the issuing office.\n\n6. Review computation of the tax base for land and improvement in accordance with the following:\n\n6.1 When the zonal value of land has been established\n\n6.1.1 Determine the value of improvements by using the formulas shown below:\n\nc. Improvements introduced in 1985 and prior years, and in cases of improvements in places other than the National Capital Region and chartered cities where there is no building permit and/or occupancy permit, use the following formula:\n\n6.1.2 Determine tax base of land and improvements as follows:\n\n6.2 When the zonal value of land has not been established\n\n6.2.1 Determine the total selling price/consideration per deed of sale of land and improvement\n\n6.2.2 Determine value of land and improvements by using the following formula:\n\n7. In case of installment sales, determine whether the taxpayer is qualified to report his gain under the installment basis. An individual is qualified to account for his gain on installment basis if the initial payment does not exceed 25% of the selling price. The term \"initial payment\" means the payment or payments which the seller receives before or upon execution of the instrument of sale and payments which he expects or is scheduled to receive in cash or property (other than evidence of indebtedness of the purchaser) during the taxable year of sale or disposition. HcSaTI\n\nExample: Assume that on October 15, 1998, an individual sold for P100,000 a real property with an adjusted basis of P60,000 under the following terms: P10,000 upon execution of sale; the balance of P90,000 in 18 equal monthly installments of P5,000 each beginning November 15, 1998. The taxpayer qualifies to pay the capital gains tax on installment because the initial payment consisting of the amount of P10,000 he received upon sale and the amount he expects or is scheduled to receive \u2014 P5,000 on November 15, 1998 and P5,000 on December 15, 1998, or a total of P20,000 during the year of sale do not exceed 25 % of the selling price.\n\n7.1 Computation of amount of tax payable on installments.\n\nIf the taxpayer qualifies and elects to pay the capital gains tax in installments, the tax may be paid in installments, the amount of each installment of which shall be the proportion of the tax so determined which are:\n\n7.1.1 On the date of sale or disposition, first payment (amount received, including the excess of the mortgage, if any, assumed by the purchaser) over the basis of the property sold; and\n\n7.1.2 In succeeding payments, the installment payment received by the seller in relation to the total contract price.\n\nIllustrations:\n\nExample 1. Assume that on January 2, 1998, an individual sold a piece of property with adjusted basis of P60,000 for P100,000 under the following terms: P20,000 downpayment; balance in five annual installments beginning 1999. Taxpayer elects and is qualified to pay the tax in installment. The periodic payment of the tax is computed as follows:\n\nComputation of total tax due:\n\nPortion of the tax payable upon sale or upon receipt of first payment is determined as follows:\n\n[First payment/Contract price] x Total\n\nTax Due = Portion of Tax Payable\n\nor\n\n[P20,000/P100,000] x P6,000= P1,200\n\nPortion of the tax payable annually for five years beginning 1999 is computed as follows:\n\nExample 2. Assume that in 1969, an individual acquired a property for P60,000. In 1999, he sold the property for P100,000. Terms of sale: Downpayment, January 2, 1998, P10,000; mortgage assumed, P40,000; balance payable in four annual installments beginning January 2, 1998. The taxpayer elects to pay the tax on the gain in installments.\n\nThe tax payments on installments received is computed as follows:\n\nExample 3. Assume that in 1998, an individual sold for P100,000 a piece of real property which he bought in 1980 for P40,000. Prior to sale, the property was mortgaged for P60,000. The terms of sale are as follows: Downpayment, P10,000; assumption of unpaid mortgage, P50,000; balance of P40,000 payable in four semi-annual payments beginning January 15, 1999. The taxpayer elects to pay the tax in installments. Amount of tax payable in installments is computed as follows:\n\n8. Confirm payment of Capital Gains Tax by cross-checking the payment thereof with the Batch Control Sheet prepared by the bank or the Collection Officer, as the case may be.\n\n9. When there is delay in the presentation of sales, documents, require the taxpayer to submit documents such as cancelled checks, official receipts or certification of the archive official to show that there is no ante-dating of public instrument. The rules and regulations applicable at the date of execution of the contract shall be applied and the increments for late filing and payment of tax shall be imposed.\n\nIf the taxpayer cannot show proofs that the same is not ante-dated, the rules applicable at the time of presentation of the document shall apply.\n\nC. Estate Tax\n\nThe following audit procedures were culled from existing revenue issuances. They enumerate the steps to be taken by a Revenue Officer in the processing, verification and investigation of estate tax returns of resident and non-resident decedents subject to estate tax. However, these do not preclude the application of other audit procedures as warranted by the circumstances surrounding each case.\n\n1. The estate tax return of a decedent and all his unverified income tax returns for the last three years prior to his death shall be simultaneously investigated by a Revenue Officer or a group of Revenue Officers, if so provided in the annual Audit Program. SEcTHA\n\nThe Revenue Officer should see to it that an income tax return covering the income and deductions of the decedent from January 1 to the date of his death has been filed. If the period covered by the return consists of less than twelve (12) months, such period shall be considered as a \"taxable year\".\n\n2. If the settlement of the estate of the decedent is the object of judicial testamentary or intestate proceedings, ascertain if:\n\n2.1 An income tax return for the estate as a taxable person has been filed by the fiduciary or administrator; and\n\n2.2 Individual returns for the spouse, heirs or beneficiaries have been filed covering their respective income from the estate and applicable deductions for the period from the date immediately following the death of the decedent to the end of the taxable year.\n\nThe estate's income tax return shall cover the income and deductions of the estate for the period from the date immediately following the death of the decedent to the end of the taxable year. Thereafter, quarterly and annual returns for the estate shall be filed until the estate is divided and distributed to the rightful heirs and beneficiaries.\n\n3. If the settlement of the estate is not the object of judicial testamentary or intestate proceedings, verify if the income of the properties left by the decedent is included in the income tax return of each heir or beneficiary according to his distributive share in the net income of the estate or co-ownership.\n\n4. Verify if a Notice of Death was filed within two (2) months after the decedent's death where the gross value of the estate exceeds twenty thousand pesos (P20,000). In case of failure to file the notice, impose the appropriate penalty even after the lapse of the prescribed period of two (2) months after the qualification of the executor or administrator. This contemplates the filing of the estate proceedings in courts and the appointment of the executor or administrator by the court.\n\n5. Determine if the value of the gross estate exceeds two million pesos (P2,000,000). If so, check whether the estate tax return is supported by a statement duly certified by a Certified Public Accountant showing the following information:\n\n5.1 Itemized assets of the decedent with their corresponding gross value at the time of his death, or in the case of a non-resident alien, of that part of his gross estate situated in the Philippines;\n\n5.2 Itemized deductions from gross estate allowed under Sec. 86 (A) of the Tax Code; and\n\n5.3 The amount of tax due whether paid or still due and outstanding.\n\n6. Examine the inventory of assets and/or liabilities not reported in the said return. Prepare an adjusted schedule of assets and liabilities as basis in computing the yearly increase in the net worth of the taxpayer up to the time of his death.\n\n7. Inquire on the source of acquisition of the property left by the decedent, whether it was acquired by purchase, donation or inheritance, for the purpose of ascertaining if such property is conjugal, exclusive or paraphernal property of the deceased.\n\n8. Scrutinize the provisions of the insurance policies taken out by the deceased upon his own life as to the designation of the beneficiary. If the designation is revocable, the proceeds of the life insurance shall be included in the gross estate. If irrevocable, the proceeds thereof shall be excluded from the gross estate, irrespective of whether or not the insured retained the power of revocation, if the beneficiary named in the policy is the estate of the decedent.\n\n9. Verify if the land, as part of gross estate specially urban land, include improvements and buildings. Secure a certification from the Assessor's Officer as to the existence of non-existence of improvements on the land. Conduct an ocular inspection of the land whenever possible.\n\n10. Conduct third party verification on certain government agencies such as Office of the Register of Deeds, Securities and Exchange Commission, Land Transportation Office, Office of the Provincial, City or Municipal Assessor for possible properties listed and registered in the name of the decedent which may not have been included in the estate tax return.\n\n11. Inquire into the bank deposits or other investments of the decedent. Pursuant to Sec. 6 (F)(1) of the Tax Code, the Commissioner is authorized to look into the bank deposits of a decedent for estate tax purposes, the provisions of Republic Act No. 1405 and other general or special laws notwithstanding. Foreign currency deposits, if any, shall be converted using the foreign exchange rate.\n\n12. Ascertain if the shares of stocks are properly valued. In doing so, observe the following rules on valuation pursuant to RAMO No. 1-82:\n\n12.1 For stocks listed or traded in the stock market:\n\n12.1.1 The selling price shall be used where there are sales made on the valuation date. The mean between the highest and lowest selling prices on valuation dates shall be the fair market value per share.\n\n12.1.2 If there were no sales on the valuation date but there were sales on dates within a reasonable period both before and after the valuation date, the fair market value is determined by taking the weighted average of the mean between the highest and the lowest sales in the nearest trading date after the valuation date. The weighted average is to be computed inversely by the respective number of trading days between the selling dates and the valuation date. The reasonable period of valuation must not exceed six months before or after the valuation date.\n\nExample:\n\nThe valuation date is January 15, Friday. Sales of stock occurred on January 13, Wednesday or two trading days before valuation date at P10.00 and on Wednesday, January 20, three days after valuation date at P15.00, the fair market value of the shares to be taken is P12.00 computed as follows:\n\n(3xP10) + (2x15) = P30 + P30 = 60 = P 12.00\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n5 5\n\n12.1.3 If actual sales of the shares are not available during a reasonable period beginning before and ending after the valuation date, the fair market value may be determined by taking the mean between bona fide bid and asked prices on the valuation date, or if none, by taking the weighted average of the mean between the bona fide bid and asked prices on the nearest trading date before and after the valuation date within a reasonable period in accordance with the formula in the preceding paragraph.\n\n12.1.4 If there are no sales or bonafide bid and asked prices available on a date within a reasonable period before the valuation date, but such prices are available on a date within a reasonable period after the valuation date, then the mean between the highest and lowest available sale prices or bid and asked prices nearest the valuation date may be taken as the value of shares. DHIcET\n\n12.1.5 If it is established that the selling or bid and asked prices as provided in the foregoing paragraphs do not reflect the fair market value thereof, modifications of the basis are to be made taking into consideration other relevant facts and elements of value. In some exceptional cases, the size of the block of stocks to be valued in relation to the number of shares transferred in sales may affect adversely the fair market value of the stocks to be valued.\n\n12.2 For unlisted stocks or stocks not quoted or traded in the stock market:\n\n12.2.1 In general, the unlisted shares shall be valued at their book value nearest the valuation date. The book value of these unlisted shares of stock shall be prima facie considered as their fair market value.\n\n12.2.2 In case the shares are valued on a basis lower than their book values, a justification for the deviation from the book value, together with the evidences in support thereof should be submitted. The following factors are considered relevant in the valuation of shares of stock of closed corporations:\n\na. The nature of the business and the financial history of the enterprise, from the date of the incorporation;\n\nb. The economic outlook in general and the business condition and outcome of the specific industry in particular;\n\nc. The financial conditions of the business;\n\nd. The earning capacity of the company;\n\ne. The dividend paying capacity;\n\nf. Goodwill;\n\ng. Sales of stocks and size of the block of stock to be valued;\n\nh. Market price of stocks of corporations engaged in the same or similar line of business to be valued;\n\ni. Existence of corporate debts in favor of the family of the principal;\n\nj. Restrictive agreements impairing the alienity of the stock;\n\nk. Investments in business or property maintained at a deficit;\n\nl. Dividend arrearages;\n\nm. Voting rights of stockholders; and\n\nn. Difficulty in liquidating the assets.\n\nIf such lower fair market valuation is not clearly established and documented, the book value of the unlisted shares of stocks shall be adopted. If there have been previous bona fide sales/exchanges of the unlisted shares of stock, the price at which these shares exchange hands should be taken/considered as its fair market value/s. Preferred shares of stocks shall always be valued at par.\n\n13. Audit of itemized deductions under Section 86 (A) of the Tax Code:\n\n13.1 Funeral Expenses\n\nRequire the submission of invoices or official receipts evidencing actual funeral-expenses. Only actual funeral expenses or an amount equal to 5% of the gross estate whichever is lower, but in no case shall exceed P200,000, may be allowed as a deduction from gross estate.\n\n13.2 Judicial Expenses\n\nCheck if the settlement of the estate is the object of judicial testamentary or intestate proceedings. If not, no deduction for judicial expenses shall be allowed. However, a reasonable amount for legal fees and accounting expenses incurred in the settlement of the estate of the decedent may be allowed. Scrutinize legal fees deducted in the estate tax return by checking the nature of the payment, the person to whom it was paid and the date of payment.\n\n13.3 Claims Against The Estate\n\n13.3.1 Verify if the claim is subject to Mortgage Redemption Insurance (MRI). If so, disallow deduction claimed.\n\n13.3.2 In the verification of claims against the estate, secure certified true copies of the following documents and verify them:\n\na. Duly notarized promissory notes or contract of loan signed by the debtor if the loan was contracted within three (3) years before the death of the decedent.\n\nb. Vouchers, cancelled checks or other documents evidencing the advances made by individuals or corporations to the deceased;\n\nc. Latest balance sheet of the corporation; and\n\nd. Other documents or evidences relevant to the grant of the loan, i.e., real estate or chattel mortgage, a copy of the Transfer Certificate of Title to show annotations thereof.\n\n13.3.3 Check the statement submitted by the administrator or executor regarding the disposition of the proceeds of the loan. If the administrator or executor fails to satisfactorily explain, in whole or in part, the disposition of the proceeds of the loan contracted within three (3) years before the death of the decedent, such proceeds or a portion thereof may be included as cash in the gross estate.\n\n13.3.4 Where the settlement is made through the court in a testate or intestate proceeding, scrutinize pertinent documents filed with the court evidencing claims against the estate or the court order approving the said claims, if a decision thereon has already been issued.\n\n13.3.5 Obtain a sworn certification from the creditor as to the exact balance of the liability of the deceased. The certification must be duly signed by the president, vice-president or other principal officer of the corporation in case the creditor is a corporation.\n\n13.3.6 Ensure that the creditor agrees in writing allowing the verification by the Revenue Officer of his pertinent records for the purpose of substantiating the claims against the estate of the deceased.\n\n13.4 Claims Against Insolvent Persons\n\n13.4.1 Determine if the Accounts, or Notes Receivable has been included as part of the gross estate. If not, disallow the claim as a deduction.\n\n13.4.2 Find out if the claims against insolvent persons may be considered as conjugal or separate property of the decedent.

Closing Conference\n\nEssential to an effective audit of internal revenue tax liabilities is the holding of a closing conference with the taxpayer before the preparation of the final report of investigation by the Revenue Officer assigned to the tax case. During this time, the Revenue Officer and his supervisor explain to the taxpayer how the assessment of his tax liability was arrived at. If necessary, the records of the case shall be presented to the taxpayer to document the Revenue Officer's findings. The taxpayer shall then be allowed to examine such records and to present his arguments. If the taxpayer agrees with the audit findings, he shall be made to sign an Agreement Form. If not, the Revenue Officer shall give the taxpayer enough time to document his objections to the proposed assessment. In both cases, the report of investigation shall be prepared and submitted to the Revenue District Officer for review and pre-approval prior to final review by the Assessment Division of the Regional Office or by the concerned office in the National Office (NO) for cases investigated by the audit divisions/teams in the NO.\n\nUpon receipt of the report of investigation, the Revenue District Officer (RDO) or head of the audit division/team in the NO shall send to the taxpayer a notice for informal conference.

Report Making\n\nThe Revenue Officer is required to make a report after the investigation/audit has been conducted. Before starting to write a report, the Revenue Officer should have in mind a definite outline as to arrangement in which the facts and evidence may be presented in the most effective manner.

                                    "Details": "I. OBJECTIVES\n\n1. To provide Revenue Officers with an Audit Manual which contains uniform procedures and techniques in the investigation of taxpayers belonging to the banking industry for the purpose of ensuring the conduct of quality audit in view of the industry's peculiarities, nature of transactions and specialized accounting system.\n\n2. To prescribe mandatory reporting requirements for all cases involving taxpayers under the banking industry.\n\nII. RATIONALE\n\nThe banking industry has a significant impact of the country's economy. As such, it is governed by special laws and is being regulated by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas. Due to the nature of business and existence of voluminous transactions, the banking industry has distinct accounting terminologies, procedures and practices, as well as financial reports. Aside from this, almost all banks have highly sophisticated computerized accounting systems. With these peculiarities of the industry and the advanced information technology being adopted by banks, it is imperative that the Bureau should have sufficient knowhow on the industry's operations and method of recording financial transactions. Thus, this manual was conceived to guide our Revenue Officers in the determination of the correct tax liabilities of banks. While the manual provides suggested audit procedures and techniques, the Revenue Officers are not precluded from applying other examination techniques which they may find relevant and necessary under the circumstances.\n\nIII. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS\n\nRevenue Officers conducting the audit/investigation of banks are required to accomplish and comply with all the reporting requirements specifically provided in this Bank Audit Manual.\n\nIV. REPEALING CLAUSE\n\nThis Order supersedes all revenue issuances or portions thereof inconsistent herewith.\n\nV. EFFECTIVITY\n\nThis Order shall take effect immediately upon approval.\n\n(SGD.) DAKILA B. FONACIER\nCommissioner of Internal Revenue\n\nAUDITS TECHNIQUES MANUAL\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nBanks\n\nI. NATURE OF BUSINESS\n\nBanks basically earn income through the spread between the cost of its funds (interest paid and the expenses of acquiring and investing funds) and the yield it can obtain by investing funds in securities or loans and income from fees charged for other services is becoming an increasingly important part of a bank's income.\n\nBanks are governed by special rules and regulations issued mostly by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) in consonance with the General Banking Act (R.A. 337 ), Central Banking Act (R.A. 265 ), Foreign Currency Deposit Act (R.A. 6426 ), and other banking laws.\n\nA large portion of the assets held by banks consists of cash and negotiable items which may be kept both for their own account and in trust for others. aTcIAS\n\nLoans constitute a major group of banks' assets. Their fair presentation involves an evaluation of the adequacy of the reserve or allowance for losses.\n\nBanks have three ways in serving the public, the community and the government.\n\nFirst, they accept deposits generally in the form of:\n\n1. savings deposits\n\n2. demand deposits\n\n3. fixed deposits (deposits with predetermined maturity dates e.g. time deposits)\n\nSecond, they extend loans. The various types of loans are:\n\n1. As to borrower/purpose:\n\n1.1 commercial loans\n\n1.2 consumer (personal) loans\n\n1.3 directors, officers, stockholders and related interests (DOSRI) loans\n\n2. As to security:\n\n2.1. clean loans\n\n2.2 secured loans\n\n2.2.1. real estate mortgage (REM) loans\n\n2.2.2 chattel mortgage (CHM) loans\n\n2.2.3 back-to-back loans (loans vs. deposits)\n\n3. Others\n\n3.1 housing\n\n3.2 retail loans\n\nThird, they act as the financial center of the public and provide other financial services such as:\n\n1. trust accounts\n\n2. safekeeping\n\n3. safekeeping\n\n4. savings bond and travelers' checks\n\n5. credit cards\n\n6. payment of utility bills\n\n7. acceptance of tax payments\n\n8. trading of securities [initial public offerings, local and foreign bonds, government securities such as treasury bills (T-bills), and private securities such as commercial papers]\n\nII. CLASSIFICATION AND FUNCTIONS OF BANKS\n\nThere are four (4) classifications of banks in the country:\n\nA. Commercial Banks\n\nA.1 Regular Commercial Banks\n\nA.2 Universal Banks or Expanded Commercial Banks\n\nB. Offshore Banks\n\nC. Specialized Government Banks\n\nD. Thrift banks\n\nD.1 Savings and Mortgage Banks\n\nD.2 Savings and Loan Associations\n\nD.3 Rural Banks\n\nD.4 Private Development Banks\n\nA. Commercial Banks\n\nCommercial banks (KBs) are institutions which are authorized to perform all types of banking operations, especially the acceptance of demand deposits and foreign exchange notes. Credits are extended to their clients or debtors in the form of loans and bills discounted, trust receipts, acceptances and bills of purchase arrangements. Furthermore, KBs can grant or extend all kinds of loans, whether short-term or long-term, secured or unsecured. Other functions of KBs include investing in government securities and in readily marketable bonds and other debt instruments issued by private entities; buying and selling of foreign exchange notes; financing import and export business activities through letters of credit; and maintaining foreign currency deposits and loans.\n\nThe universal banks or expanded commercial banks (EKBs) under the expanded banking system are allowed to underwrite or invest in non-allied undertakings such as leasing, insurance, securities brokering, investment or merchant banking, and foreign exchange trading. Non-commercial banks, on the other hand, are only limited in the performance of allied undertakings like investing in holding companies and performing commercial and thrift banking activities.\n\nA foreign bank may apply for either a commercial or an expanded commercial banking license. Foreign banks without branches in the Philippines may have equity participation in local companies engaged in allied undertakings.\n\nThe functions of Commercial Banks are:\n\n1. Accept deposits and trust accounts from residents and non-residents:\n\n2. Grant loans or credits to clients/borrowers:\n\n3. Deposit with foreign banks abroad, offshore banking units (OBUs) and other foreign currency deposit units (FCDUs);\n\n4. Invest in foreign-currency-denominated debt instruments:\n\n5. Grant foreign currency loans as may be allowed by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas:\n\n6. Borrow from other FCDUs, OBUs, and from non-residents subject to existing rules on foreign borrowings:\n\n7. Engage in foreign currency-swap with the BSP, as well as with other FCDUs and OBUs:\n\n8. Engage in foreign exchange trading; and with prior BSP approval, engage in financial futures and option trading: and\n\n9. On request/instructions of its foreign correspondent bank, it may:\n\n9.1 Issue letters of credit for a non-resident importer in favor of a non-resident exporter.\n\n9.2 Pay, accept, or negotiate drafts/bills of exchange drawn under the letter of credit; and\n\n9.3 Make payment to the order of the non-resident exporter.\n\nB. Offshore Banks\n\nOffshore banking units (OBUs) operate under the regulatory guidelines prescribed by the Monetary Board of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP). The Monetary Board requires that only banks which are organized under any law other than those of the Republic of the Philippines and their branches, subsidiaries or affiliates are qualified to operate offshore banking units in the Philippines. The local branches of foreign banks are authorized to accept foreign currency deposits only upon receipt of a corresponding certificate of authority to operate as an offshore banking unit which is issued by the Monetary Board. In issuing the certificates of authority to operate as offshore banking units, the Monetary Board takes into consideration the applicant's liquidity and solvency position, net worth and resources, management, international banking expertise, contribution to the Philippine economy, and other relevant factors such as participation in equity of local commercial banks and appropriate geographic representation.\n\nThe BSP neither considers nor accepts the application to operate an offshore banking unit unless the applicant submits a sworn undertaking from its head office, parent or holding company that it will provide and maintain in its offshore banking unit net office funds the minimum amount of US$1,000,000.00.\n\nForeign Currency Deposit Unit (FCDU)\n\nForeign currency deposit unit refers to that unit of a local bank or a local branch of a foreign bank authorized by the BSP to engage in foreign currency-denominated transactions.\n\nCommercial banks may be authorized to function under the expanded foreign currency deposit system if they meet the following minimum qualifications:\n\n1. Its networth or combined capital accounts (the total of unimpaired paid-in capital, surplus, and undivided profits, net of such valuation reserves and other capital adjustments) is at least equal to the minimum capital requirement for a commercial bank as prescribed by the Monetary Board;\n\n2. It has shown profitable operations for a period of two (2) consecutive business years immediately preceding the date of application;\n\n3. It has substantially complied with the applicable laws and existing rules and regulations of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas; and\n\n4. Bank officers shall have at least two (2) years of actual experience in foreign exchange operations or related activities or have undergone training in foreign exchange operations acceptable to the BSP.\n\nC. Specialized Government Banks\n\nThere are three (3) banks classified as specialized government banks under the present system. These banks are the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP), the Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) and the Philippine Amanah Bank These banks are under the control of the Philippine Government.\n\nDBP is licensed as a universal bank (EKB). It is mandated to help spur the growth of the agriculture industry and to promote the establishment of the private development banks (PDBs). DBP, however, is the only EKB that does not perform foreign exchange operations, although it serves as one of the channels of the government's foreign borrowings from multilateral and bilateral funding sources. Loans extended by DBP are primarily channelled to the following activities:\n\n1. The establishment or development of agricultural and industrial enterprises including public utilities, mining, livestock, and fisheries;\n\n2. Home building and home-financing projects;\n\n3. Purchase of preferred shares of agricultural or industrial enterprises to finance their fixed and operating capital requirements; and\n\n4. Various local government unit-sponsored activities such as construction of public markets, toll bridges, waterworks and other relevant generating services.\n\nThe LBP is principally mandated to finance agrarian reform programs. Licensed as a commercial bank, LBP's banking operations subsidizes the government's agrarian reform activities.\n\nThe Philippine Amanah Bank is intended to serve the financing and banking needs of the Muslim community.\n\nD. Thrift Banks\n\nThrift banks are organized in the form of stock corporations. The Monetary Board of the BSP sets the minimum paid-up capital of thrift banks in an amount the Board considers necessary for the safe and sound operations of thrift banks and for the protection of the general public. Thrift banks are not allowed to organize without prior issuance of a certificate of authority from the Monetary Board.\n\nThrift banks are primarily intended to encourage further savings and meet the credit needs of households and small and medium enterprises. Thrift banks are categorized into savings and mortgage banks (SMBs), stock savings and loan associations (SSLAs), rural banks, and private development banks (PDBs). SMBs accept savings deposit and invest them in medium and long-term loans to assist in business and housing requirements. On the other hand, SSLAs accumulate the savings of their members and shareholders and utilize these funds for loans or as investments. Meanwhile, PDBs serve the needs for capital and adequate investment credit in the form of long-term and medium-term loans to businesses.\n\nUnder RA No. 7906 or the Thrift Banks Act which was enacted in 1995, thrift banks are also authorized to invest in the equities of allied undertakings subject to certain conditions. Allied undertakings include banking and finance, leasing, farming and agriculture-related activities and other activities as may be determined by the Monetary Board.\n\nThe Monetary Board of the BSP supervises the operations of thrift banks which may consist of placing limits to the maximum credit allowed to any individual borrower, indicating the manner in which technical assistance shall be extended to thrift banks; imposing a uniform accounting system and the manner of keeping the accounts and records; instituting periodic surveys of loans and lending procedures, audits, test-check of cash and other transactions; conducting training courses for personnel; and supervising their business operations.\n\nThe functions of thrift banks are:\n\n1. Accept deposits and trust accounts from residents and non-residents;\n\n2. Grant loans or credits to clients/borrowers;\n\n3. Deposit, on short-term maturity, with foreign banks abroad, OBUs and other FCDUs;\n\n4. Invest in foreign currency-denominated debt instruments which are of short-term maturity, and are readily marketable;\n\n5. Grant short-term foreign currency loans as may be allowed under existing BSP rules and regulations;\n\n6. Borrow, on short-term maturity, from other FCDUs and from foreign banks abroad, and OBUs, subject to existing rules on foreign borrowings; and\n\n7. Engage in foreign currency-swap with the BSP, as well as with other FCDUs and OBUs.\n\nD.1 Savings and Mortgage Banks\n\nSavings and mortgage banks are corporations organized primarily for the purpose of accumulating the small savings of depositors and investing them, together with its capital, in bonds or in loans secured by bonds, real estate mortgages, and other forms of security.\n\nThe loans and investments of saving and mortgage banks are generally limited to the following, subject to the rules and regulations of the Monetary Board of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP):\n\n1. Loans with the security of their own savings deposit obligations or of mortgage and chattel mortgage bonds which they have issued, or with the security of savings deposit obligations of other banks doing business in the Philippines.\n\n2. Medium-term loans of the following types:\n\na. Loans for the encouragement of cattle, carabao and other livestock breeding which shall be repaid in regular installments and shall have as principal security a lien on the animals, real estate and other securities, to the bank's satisfaction.\n\nb. Equipment loans for the acquisition of instruments, machinery, and other movable equipment including fertilizers used in the production, processing, transformation, handling or transportation of agricultural and industrial products. Such loans shall constitute a first lien on the assets acquired with the proceeds of the loan, together with the lien on other properties of the debtor.\n\n3. Mortgage loans for the conservation, enlargement or improvement of the productive properties, or the acquisition of machinery or other property with fixed installation. Such loans shall be secured by a first mortgage on the property.\n\n4. Real estate mortgage loans for the following purposes:\n\n4.1 For the construction, acquisition, expansion or improvement of rural and urban properties.\n\n(a) For the refinancing of similar loans and mortgages; and\n\n(b) For such other purposes as may be authorized by the Monetary Board of the BSP.\n\n5. High-grade bonds and other evidences of indebtedness, and loans against such obligations.\n\n6. Drafts, bills of exchange, acceptances, or notes arising out of current commercial transactions which are endorsed or accepted by any solvent bank operating in the Philippines.\n\n7. Collateral trust bonds or notes, or obligations secured by such bonds or notes, secured by a first mortgage or by a participating interest in a first mortgage on improved urban or rural real estate in cities and municipalities of the Philippines.\n\n8. Loans secured by the pledge to the corporation/borrower of gold or silver bullion.\n\n9. Loans with first mortgages transferred to the corporation/borrower as collateral security on improved and otherwise unencumbered real estate.\n\nD.2. Savings and Loan Association\n\nSavings and loan associations are corporations whose capital stock is required or is permitted to be paid in by the stockholders in regular, equal, periodical payments and whose purpose is to accumulate the savings of its stockholders, to repay said stockholders thru accumulated savings and profits upon surrender of their shares, to encourage industry, frugality, and home building among its stockholders on the security of their investments and with the pledge of shares of the capital stock owned by such stockholders as collateral security.\n\nThe capital stock of such associations shall be paid in by the stockholders in regular, equal, periodical payments known as dues, at such times in such amounts as shall be provided in the by-laws of the association. The dues of each share of stock subscribed for a stockholder shall continue to be paid by the stockholder to the association until the share has been duly withdrawn, cancelled or forfeited or until the share has reached its matured value (i.e., when the dues paid on each share and the net earnings thereof in accordance with the by-laws shall amount to the matured value of the share). However, such association may issue and sell paid-up stock for each and also investment stock to be paid in installments, and may pay to the holders of such paid-up stock out of the net profits such rates dividends as may be fixed from time to time by the board of directors of the association, which shall be expressed in the stock certificates and shall not participate further in the profits or accretions of the association.\n\nD.3 Rural Banks\n\nRural banking was introduced in 1952 to serve the credit needs of small borrowers in the rural areas that are considered as poor risks by commercial banks (KBs) due to their lack of bankable properties. Rural banks are like thrift banks, except that their clientele include, among others, farmers and cooperatives in rural communities. Loans or advances extended by rural banks are primarily for the purpose of meeting the normal credit needs of farmers, fishermen or farm families owning or cultivating land dedicated to agricultural production, as well as the normal credit needs of cooperatives and merchants. In the granting of loans, the rural banks give preference to applicants whose cash requirements are small.\n\nD.4 Private Development Banks\n\nDevelopment banks are organized in the form of stock corporations to provide banking services principally to service the needs of agricultural and industrial enterprises, particularly in the countryside and preferably for small and medium enterprises. These banks are also authorized to perform all other functions of a thrift bank.\n\nIn general, development banks are established to undertake the following activities:\n\n1. To accept such deposits as are allowed thrift banks under existing laws and BSP regulations including, but not limited to demand, savings, and time deposits;\n\n2. To grant loans for the establishment, development or expansion of any agricultural or industrial enterprise;\n\n3. To accept and manage trust funds and properties and carry on the business of a trust corporation;\n\n4. To acquire, assign, or otherwise dispose of marketable securities and other debt instruments which are essential to the effective conduct of their general banking activities; and\n\n5.

Determine the business purpose for such insurance and check their coverage and effectivity dates as reflected in the policy to determine qualification for deductibility as prescribed under existing laws, rules and regulations.\n\n5.2 Vouch premium payments by tracing the same to the corresponding official receipts issued by the insurance company.\n\n6. Interest Expense\n\n6.1 Determine the amount of interest expense charged to operations giving due consideration to the limitations set forth under Republic Act No. 1605 with respect to secrecy of bank deposits:\n\n6.1.1 Determine the total amount of interest expense as reflected in the audited financial statements, particularly the statement of income and expenses.\n\n6.1.2 Classify and analyze interest expense account in accordance with the types of liabilities incurred (i.e., deposits and deposits substitutes, trust funds and similar investments and long-term deposits, and availments of regular loans from domestic and foreign sources).\n\n6.1.3 Test-check documents in support of interest-bearing obligations and payments/accruals of interests to prove legitimacy of the transactions and established basis of interest computation.\n\n6.1.4 Verify whether accruals or prepayments of interests on borrowed funds were properly taken up in the books.\n\n6.1.5 Test-check accuracy of interest computations and trace the corresponding cost slips and/or debit and credit tickets for interests charged to operations to the entries in the expense ledger. Account for any discrepancy.\n\n6.2 Verify the propriety of allowing the deductibility of interest expenses that are considered as reconciling items in the income tax return.\n\n6.3 Account for charges to interest expense that are subject to applicable final or creditable withholding taxes. Compare the same with the amounts of interests actually subjected to withholding taxes. Reconcile any noted discrepancy.\n\n6.4 Test-check recorded interest expense against the loan documents and entries in the bank's ledgers.\n\n6.5 Verify whether some interest expenses were treated as direct offsets against interest income. If such is the case, include the amount offset to the basis of the computation of gross receipts tax and withholding taxes on interest expenses, if such amount was not part of the taxable base.\n\n6.6 Test reasonableness of interest expense by multiplying the average balance of major categories of debt outstanding by average or stated interest rates. Normally, interest expense on deposits is computed by averaging the daily balance (ADB) of the accounts on a quarterly basis.\n\n7. Travel and Entertainment Expenses\n\n7.1 Scan the general ledger for charges to travel and entertainment expenses which are significant in amount.\n\n7.2 Vouch the supporting documents evidencing payment of these expenses.\n\n7.3 Obtain copies of the minutes of meetings or any document which outlines the company policy for travel and entertainment. Watch out for expenses classified as traveling and entertainment which are actually part of the gross compensation of bank executives or granted as fringe benefits under Section 33 of the Tax Code.\n\n7.4 Test-check existence of individual authorizations of employees who incurred substantial travel and entertainment expenses.\n\n7.5 Ascertain that the proper withholding tax is withheld on income payments to travel agencies and other payees.\n\n8. Losses and Bad Debts\n\n8.1 Ascertain that the following requisites for deductibility of bad debts as set forth under Revenue Regulations No. 5-99 are met:\n\n8.1.1 There must be an existing indebtedness due to the taxpayer which must be valid and legally demandable;\n\n8.1.2 The same must be connected with the taxpayer's trade, business or practice of profession;\n\n8.1.3 The same must not be sustained in a transaction entered into between related parties enumerated under Sec. 36(B) of the Tax Code.\n\n8.1.4 The same must be actually charged off in the books of accounts of the taxpayer as of the end of the taxable year and not merely set up as a provision for uncollectible accounts; and\n\n8.1.5 The Bangko Sentral Pilipinas (BSP), thru is Monetary Board, should have ascertained the worthlessness and uncollectibility of the bad debts and it should have approved the writing off of the said indebtedness from the bank's books of accounts at the end of the taxable year.\n\n8.2 Check whether losses are treated as direct offsets against income. Consider the possibility that the taxpayer may have adopted this practice in order to reduce or minimize income or receipts subject to gross receipts tax.\n\n8.3 Analyze losses sustained from foreign currency transactions. Verify whether claims for translation losses were actually realized/sustained during the taxable year. Otherwise, these should be added back to taxable income.\n\nC. GROSS RECEIPTS TAX\n\n1. Verify gross income subject to Gross Receipts Tax (GRT) such as interests, commissions/discounts from lending activities and income from financial leasing based on the remaining maturities of the instruments.\n\n2. Check whether the appropriate tax rates were used by performing the following procedures:\n\n2.1 Segregate beginning and ending balances of loans/other income receivables and unearned discounts. Classify those receivables/discounts into accounts from taxable and exempt income accounts.\n\n2.2 Ascertain that all income subjected to final tax are properly taken up at gross amounts.\n\n2.3 In computing the correct gross receipts subject to tax, the following basic formula may be used:\n\n2.4 Test-check whether gross receipt tax rates applied on the interest payments received were adjusted when remaining maturities change, as in the case of pre-terminated loans.\n\n2.5 Request for copies of the quarterly percentage tax returns and the working papers prepared by the taxpayer showing the items of gross receipts and the computation of the gross receipts tax paid. Compare gross receipts tax due per audit with the gross receipts tax payments during the year.\n\n2.6 Compute the corresponding GRT due on items of additional taxable gross receipts discovered during the audit which cannot be justified or refuted by the taxpayer.\n\nD. DOCUMENTARY STAMPS TAX\n\n1. Ascertain whether all issued documents on transactions covered under Title VII of the Tax Code have been subjected to the payment of the documentary stamp taxes (DST) at prescribed rates.\n\n1.1 Analyze the transactions that are subject to DST. The account used by banks to record transactions subject to DST must be determined with emphasis on the nature of transactions and not on the accounts used. (e.g. trust certificate, deposit substitute, special savings in lieu of time deposit, reverse repurchase agreements [RRPs], etc.). After eliminating adjustments and correcting entries, these accounts can be used in computing the banks' DST liabilities. Refer to BSP-prescribed chart of accounts in identifying these taxable transactions.\n\n1.1.1 Test-check accuracy of amounts of loans extended.\n\n1.1.2 Check whether the DST on inter-bank call loans were paid.\n\n1.1.2.1 Ascertain the maturity periods of Inter-bank Call Loans to determine whether the DST shall be imposed, as follows:\n\nif maturity is < 5days \u2014 exempt from DST\n\nif maturity is > 5days \u2014 subject to DST\n\n1.1.3 Verify the accuracy of DST payments on acceptances and/or payments of bills of exchange (domestic or foreign) by performing the following steps:\n\n1.1.3.1 Test check copies of acceptances or bills of exchange on file;\n\n1.1.3.2 Trace the information on the drafts or documents received with the entries in the ledger account.\n\n1.1.3.3 Sum up total amount arising from these transactions and compute for the prescribed DST.\n\n1.1.4 On letters of credit issued, determine the total amount of letters of credit issued during the year from the general ledger. Determine whether the correct DSTs were paid thereon.\n\n1.1.5 Check whether the correct DSTs were paid for certificates of deposits, including savings deposits with specific maturity dates.\n\n1.1.5.1 Sum up all general ledger credit postings to these deposit accounts.\n\n1.1.5.2 Test-check existence of adjustments to these accounts to determine propriety of the transactions.\n\n1.1.5.3 Compute the appropriate amount of DST due on these issued certificates.\n\n1.1.6 Verify completeness and accuracy of amounts of all loans extend, if monthly reports for loan releases, renewals, restructuring, and extensions are available.\n\n1.1.6.1 Test-check loan ledgers and match the loan details reflected thereat with the data or information appearing in the loan documents.\n\n1.1.6.2 Examine on a test-basis the documents in support of loans such as loan agreements, promissory notes, hold-out agreements, sureties, deeds of real estate mortgage, deeds of chattel mortgage, etc.\n\n1.1.6.3 Sum up all the debts in the general ledgers of the loan accounts and deduct therefrom all valid adjustments. These loan accounts may include, among others, loans and discounts, bills purchased, customers' liability on bill, etc. Account for any discrepancy noted and determine the implication of discovered discrepancy on its DST liability.\n\n1.1.6.4 Compute the correct DST due on the loan documents issued for these loan accounts.\n\n1.1.7 Determine whether there are additional subscriptions of capital stocks and/or declarations of stock dividends during the taxable year. Check whether the appropriate DSTs were paid on issued stock certificates or subscribed capital stock in accordance with existing rules and regulations.\n\n2. Summarize all payments of DST made by the head office and all the branches based on BIR Form Nos. 2000/2002 filed during the year. Compare the total amount of DST due as ascertained per audit with the total amount of DST paid during the year. Account for any discrepancy noted and compute for the corresponding deficiency DST assessment.\n\n3. Check whether all payments of DSTs were made on time in accordance with existing laws and regulations.\n\nE. WITHHOLDING TAX\nE.1 General Audit Procedures\n\nIn order to ascertain whether taxes on all income payments subject to withholding tax have been properly withheld and remitted, the following audit procedures may be performed:\n\n1. Reconcile the information from records of the head office and branches as reflected in the withholding tax returns and alpha list of recipients of income payments duly filed with the BIR against the expenses subject to withholding tax shown in the audited financial statements and income tax returns.\n\n2. Prepare an analysis of all withholding taxes (compensation, creditable at source, and final) withheld and remitted.\n\nE.2 Specific Audit Procedures\n\n1. Withholding Tax on Compensation\n\n1.1 Test-check the accuracy of computation of withholding taxes on employees with annual salaries of over P200,000.00 on the basis of monthly payroll registers. Ascertain that corresponding taxes withheld have been remitted.\n\n1.2 Determine whether the prescribed taxes have been withheld from employees' fringe benefits, allowances, and other emoluments.\n\n1.3 Reconcile summary of payments of salaries, wages, etc. to employees with the amounts appearing in the alphabetical list of employees from whom taxes were withheld during the year.\n\n1.4 Determine deficiency withholding tax due for differences noted which the taxpayer cannot satisfactorily explain or justify .\n\n2. Expanded Withholding Tax\n\n2.1 Account for all expenses subject to expanded withholding taxes. Take note of expenses which were directly offset against income accounts. Include such amount to determine the correct basis in the computation of taxes withheld.\n\n2.2 Compute for the expanded withholding taxes due on these income payments and reconcile the same with the amount actually withheld and remitted to the BIR.\n\n3. Final Withholding Tax\n\n3.1 Ascertain the existence of income payments to residents and non-residents that are subject to final withholding taxes. In general, the following income payments are subject to final withholding taxes:\n\na. Interest on any currency bank deposit and yield or any other monetary benefit from deposit substitute and from trust fund and similar arrangements;\n\nb. Interest paid under the expanded foreign currency deposit system;\n\nc. Interest on foreign currency loans granted by FCDUs;\n\nd. Income payments to depository banks arising from foreign currency transactions under the expanded foreign currency deposit system;\n\ne. Capital gains realized from sale, exchange, or other disposition of real properties located in the Philippines classified as capital assets;\n\nf. Income payments from foreign currency transactions, whenever applicable, depending upon the agreement between the bank and the borrower;\n\ng. Branch profit remittances, if any; and\n\nh. Dividends, rents, royalties, etc., whenever applicable.\n\n3.2 Review pertinent contracts relative to these income payments to ascertain the correct tax base and their respective due dates for payments/remittances.\n\n3.3 Check the provisions of existing laws and regulations to establish the taxability of the transactions and determine the applicable tax rates (e.g., codal provision on taxable items and tax rates, tax treaty provisions, special law granting tax exemption, etc.).\n\n3.4 Reconcile all income payments subject to final withholding taxes with the amount of actual payments as reflected in the pertinent accounts in the audited financial statements such as interest expense, royalties, dividend declarations, etc. Segregate taxable and exempt transactions for purposes of determining the correct taxable base.\n\n3.5 Determine if there are any income payments to residents and non-residents not subjected to final withholding taxes (e.g. branch profit remittances, interests, dividends, royalties, etc.), taking into account the existence of special laws affecting the tax treatment of these income payments, the applicable tax treaty provisions, if any, and such other circumstances that may affect the taxability of the transactions.\n\n3.6 Check the accuracy of computation of withholding taxes due on interest payments subject to 20%, 10%, and 7.5% final taxes as well as all other payments subject to final withholding tax at source. Determine whether there are cases of under-withholding of final tax.\n\n3.7 Ascertain whether the final taxes withheld at source were remitted on time.\n\nF.

OBJECTIVE\n\nThis Order is issued to provide Revenue Officers with the basic procedures and techniques in the audit of Value-Added Tax (VAT) returns and prescribe the use of the Updated Value-Added Tax Manual (Annex \"A\").\n\nII. QUALITY AUDIT\n\nThe audit of a tax return is a tool utilized by management to determine the degree of taxpayers' compliance with existing laws, rules and regulations. While collection of taxes thru audit has been one of the major initiatives of this Bureau, the primordial purpose for conducting the same should be focused more on identifying the weaknesses in tax administration that need to be properly addressed with the end view of enhancing the level of taxpayer's voluntary compliance. This objective can only be accomplished by conducting a quality audit of taxpayers' books of accounts and other pertinent records in sufficient depth in order to ascertain correctness and validity of entries therein and the propriety of interpretation and application of tax laws, rules and regulations. cdlex\n\nIII. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS\n\nRevenue Officers are required to make a report after the audit has been conducted.

Introduction\n\nThe Bureau of Internal Revenue is one of the oldest institutions of the Republic mainly responsible for tax administration in the country. Its function is to generate income to defray the necessary expenditures of the government through the enforcement and collection of taxes needed to carry-out its development programs.\n\nThe mission of the Bureau is to collect taxes efficiently and effectively for and at the least cost to the government through impartial and consistent enforcement of internal revenue tax laws, and convenient and honest service to taxpayers. LLpr\n\nIn order to achieve the Bureau's mission, a quality tax audit must be performed to ascertain the correctness and reliability of income tax returns. The Bureau recognizes that it is not through the implementation of new taxes that they can generate more revenues but through better enforcement of tax collection.\n\na. Purpose\n\nThe updated VAT Audit Manual has been prepared for all revenue officers who conduct field examinations of tax returns to ensure the performance of a quality audit. The manual aims to equip the users with the necessary knowledge, useful auditing skills and confidence in the conduct of the audit. The Manual has been designed to ensure that the examination of internal revenue tax returns are competently and skillfully undertaken.\n\nb. Contents of the Manual\n\nThe Manual contains specialized auditing procedures and techniques in the examination of the taxpayers' value-added tax liabilities. Several schedules are provided for proper documentation of audit reports.\n\nThe revenue officer is, however, not precluded from performing such other auditing procedures and techniques as he deems necessary based on the circumstances prevailing in each particular case. prLL\n\nAUDIT OF VALUE-ADDED TAX LIABILITIES\n\n(Ref.

Preliminary Approach to Investigation\n\nPrior to actual field investigation, the Revenue Officer should perform the following analytical procedures.\n\n1. Familiarize with the business of the taxpayer and determine the economic activity in which it is engaged in, whether sale of goods, properties or services.\n\n2. Ascertain if the taxpayer maintains branches or other business establishments other than its main office. Determine the actual number and locations of branches and storage facilities being maintained by the taxpayer from the internal and external sources and validate the same from the registration records of the concerned RDOs.\n\n3. Determine if the taxpayer is engaged in other lines of business aside from its principal undertaking.\n\n4. Conduct ocular inspection of the taxpayer's premises such as production plant, sales outlets and/or storage facilities. Relate the equipment in use, the product lines being carried, and the estimated value of the business being handled with the amount of sales declared for tax purposes.\n\n5. Study the accounting methods and peculiarities in the industry group where the taxpayer belongs.\n\n6. If possible, conduct interviews with responsible accounting and sales personnel to determine the degree of internal control.\n\n7. Examine the quarterly VAT returns and monthly VAT declarations filed. LLjur\n\n7.1 Check if all the required information are properly reflected thereat.\n\n7.2 Check whether the return was filed and the appropriate tax due was paid on time.\n\n7.3 Verify if a Tax Debit Memo (TDM) has been issued authorizing the application of TCC against VAT, if applicable, by the appropriate office.\n\n8. Scrutinize the validation of payment on the VAT declaration/returns. Verify payment thru Batch Control Sheet (BCS-A)/ledger cards with the collection section of the District for non-ITS and Collections and Bank Reconciliation (CBR) system for ITS RDOs to ascertain its remittance. Determine if the bank issued the corresponding Official Receipt, Bank Debit or Credit Memo depending on the nature of payment. Watch out for fake validations. In the event that an Official Receipt is required to be issued by the accredited agent bank prior to receipt and validation of VAT payments, compare the details of payment shown in the Official Receipt with the bank validation information reflected in the VAT declarations/returns. Verify any discrepancy noted.\n\n9. Refer to the report of the audit of the value-added tax liabilities of the taxpayer for the immediately preceding period to be aware of the deficiencies noted that may also be relevant in the audit of the current period, if there is any. cdrep\n\n10. Check reasonableness of sales and purchases together with output and input taxes declared. Verify mathematical computations.\n\n11. Tally input tax carried over against the VAT return for the prior period.\n\n12. Identify significant changes in sales and purchases and VAT payments from the immediately preceding period with the period under audit.\n\n13. Obtain complete documentary requirements enumerated under Schedule V-6 of this Manual for claims for VAT credit/refund.\n\n14. Request for the books of accounts and accounting records to be examined per Schedule V-7 hereof.\n\nB. Audit of Sales and Output Tax\n\n1. Gross Taxable Sale of Goods, Properties and Services\n\na. Reconcile the amount of each category of sales per monthly VAT declarations quarterly VAT returns and financial statements with the recorded amount of sales per general ledger, sales journal, including the control subsidiary sales ledger of the head office and subsidiary sales journal for each branch.\n\nb. Review the composition of the sales account in the journals and ledgers and ascertain that:\n\nb.1 Only those transactions which are specifically exempted under Sec. 109 of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) of 1997 are treated as exempt sales.\n\nb.2 \"Deemed\" sales of goods are recorded as taxable transactions:\n\nb.2.1 Transfer, use or consumption not in the course of business of goods or properties originally intended for sale or for use in the course of business. Transfer of goods or properties not in the course of business can take place when a VAT-registered person withdraws goods from his business for his personal use. LLjur\n\nb.2.2 Distribution or transfer to shareholders or investors as share in the profits of the VAT- registered person. Property dividends which constitute stock- in-trade or properties primarily held for, sale or lease declared out of retained earnings on or after January 1, 1996 and distributed by the company to its shareholders shall be, subject to VAT based on the zonal value or fair market value at the time of distribution whichever is applicable.\n\nb.2.3 Transfer to creditors in payment of debt or obligation.\n\nb.2.4 Consignment of goods if actual sale is not made within 60 days following the date when such goods were consigned. Consigned goods returned by the consignee within the 60-day period is not deemed sold.\n\nb.2.5 Retirement from or cessation of business with respect to all goods on hand, whether capital goods, stock-in-trade, supplies or materials as of the date of such retirement or cessation, whether or not the business is continued by the new owner or successor. The following circumstances shall, among others, give rise to transactions \"deemed-sale\".\n\n\u2022 change of ownership of the business\n\n\u2022 dissolution of a partnership other than a general professional partnership and creation of a new partnership which takes over the business\n\nc. Verify entries appearing in the subsidiary and/or sales journal and compare the same with the information shown in the sales invoices.\n\nd. Test the accuracy of the sales summary against the source documents.\n\ne. Determine compliance with the invoicing requirements and procedures.\n\ne.1 Ascertain that invoices and official receipts bear all necessary information as required under Sec. 113 (A) and 237 of the NIRC, as amended by Republic Act (RA) 8424, and Sec. 4.108-1 of Revenue Regulations (RR) 7-95.\n\ne.2 Check whether the words \"zero-rated\" are printed on the invoice covering zero-rated sales. Otherwise, the transaction shall be considered, as taxable since the concerned customer may be able to generate input credit for the transaction.\n\ne.3 Verify authority to print receipts/invoices with the Revenue Regulatory Unit (RRU) of the concerned RDO. LLpr\n\nf. Ensure that all receipts and invoices issued to customers including those assigned to branches are all accounted for. Account for any break in the sequence of their serial numbers. In case of cancellation, the original copy thereof should be on file.\n\ng. For those using loose-leaf invoices/cash register machines, verify with the RRU or require presentation of authority to use the same. Verify the number of cash registers authorized to be used in the establishment. Be alert on the possibility that unregistered machines are being used for unrecorded transactions.\n\nh. Be alert if the taxpayer is practicing the following schemes:\n\nh.1 use of double or multiple set of invoices/receipts bearing identical serial numbers\n\nh.2 unregistered invoices/receipts\n\nh.3 non-issuance of official receipts or invoices\n\ni. Verify if the transactions covered by \"Statement of Account\", \"Delivery Receipt\", \"Debit Notes\" and other similar documents are properly recorded as sales. The mere issuance of these documents without the corresponding sales invoice is a violation of the bookkeeping regulations and an indication of unrecorded sales, except in the case of bona fide consignment sales.\n\nj. When verifying ,a delivery receipt, ascertain whether it covers a consummated sale or consignment sale. Consignment sale shall be considered as taxable sale after sixty (60) days following the date of consignment.\n\nk. Check whether information reflected in the sales invoices /official receipts tally with other complementary documents such as purchase orders, delivery receipts, etc.\n\nl. If the taxpayer is engaged in both taxable and exempt transactions, ascertain that only VAT invoices are issued for VAT taxable transactions and separate invoices are issued for exempt transactions.\n\nAny person whose sale of goods, properties or services which are otherwise not subject to VAT but who issues a VAT invoice or receipt therefor shall, in addition to his liability to other applicable percentage tax, if any, be liable to VAT without benefit of any input tax credit.\n\nm. Test check footings in the sales and subsidiary sales journals and posting to general ledger. cda\n\nn. Verify sales contracts, marketing agreements, consignment terms and other sales related documents.\n\no. Scrutinize miscellaneous and other income accounts and ascertain if such accounts are subject to VAT.\n\np. Examine the cash receipts book and official receipts issued to uncover any collection which may not have been included in the taxable sale.\n\nq. Be resourceful in discovering under declaration of sales. Abnormal levels of inventories, sales, purchases, accounts receivables, including manipulation of interbranch transactions, among others, may suggest instances of under declaration.\n\nq.1. Cross check transactions reflected in the books of accounts against the records of selected customers and obtain certification of sales/purchases from selected buyers/suppliers.\n\nq.2 Reconcile the sale or receipts reported per VAT returns with the amount of sales/receipts subjected to withholding tax reflected in the withholding tax certificate submitted by customers to BIR.\n\nr. If necessary, analyze all the accounts affecting total sales, particularly cash account, accounts and/or notes receivable, collections from receivables, sales discounts and sales returns, bad debts written off and other relevant accounts.\n\nIn auditing sales of services, analyze other accounts such as advances, retention receivables, mobilization fees and other related accounts. (See pro-forma computations on Schedules V1-V4).\n\ns. Compare sales of other taxpayers belonging to the same industry within the vicinity/location.\n\nt. Identify instances where the gross selling price of goods or properties are being unreasonably lower than the actual market value and look into the possibility of making necessary adjustments in the sales value thereof. cdasia\n\nu. If the accounting records are unreliable, look into gate-passes, purchase order registers and other records used by the taxpayer in its day-to-day transactions.\n\nv. Ascertain the correctness of output tax computation.\n\nw. Verify whether other charges such as excise tax, packaging, insurance, freight and delivery expenses are treated as part of the gross taxable sales. The excise tax, if any, shall form part of taxable sales.\n\nx. Account for deductions from sales such as:\n\nx.1 Discounts granted and determined at the time of sale which do not depend upon the happening of a future event, expressly indicated on the face of the invoice and previously recorded in the books of accounts. These discounts may be excluded from gross sales within the same month/quarter it was given.\n\nx.2 Sales returns and allowances for which proper credit or refund was made during the month or quarter to the buyer for sales previously recorded as taxable sales.\n\ny. In case the taxpayer enjoys full or partial exemption pursuant to special laws, verify the extent of exemption and compliance with the conditions set for the enjoyment of such exemptions. Obtain documentary confirmation of such exemption.\n\nV-1\n\nApply the following pro-forma computation to arrive at the total sale of goods -\n\nNote: All accounts from V-1 to V-4 should be net of VAT.\n\n2.  Zero-Rated and Foreign Currency Denominated Sales\n\na. Determine whether sales declared as zero-rated actually emanate from export sales or foreign currency denominated sales and other transactions that may qualify as zero-rated or effectively zero-rated sales.\n\nb. For actual export sales, review commercial invoices/receipts, bills of lading or airway bill, export declaration permit, packing list, inward letters of credit, landing certificates and other related commercial documents. Ascertain if the proceeds were paid for in acceptable foreign currency or its equivalent in goods or services and accounted for in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP). Obtain schedule with the following information and check against supporting documents: cdt\n\n\u2022 Date of Export\n\n\u2022 Sales Invoice No.\n\n\u2022 Name of Consignee\n\n\u2022 AWB/BL NO.\n\n\u2022 Shipment Date\n\n\u2022 Amount of Sales in Foreign Currency and in Pesos Per Invoice\n\n\u2022 Conversion Rate\n\n\u2022 Amount of Remittance in Pesos\n\n\u2022 Amount of Sales per Books\n\n\u2022 Discrepancy Between Amount of Sales per Invoice in Pesos and Amount of Remittance in Pesos\n\n\u2022 Discrepancy Between Amount of Remittance in Pesos and Amount of Sales per Books\n\nc. For effectively zero-rated transactions, secure copy of the application for zero-rating as approved by the Revenue District Office. Without an approved application, the transaction otherwise entitled to zero-rating shall be considered exempt.\n\nd. For \"foreign currency denominated sales\", review the transactions and ascertain if:\n\nd.1 the buyer is a non-resident;\n\nd.2 the goods other than those mentioned in Secs. 149 (automobiles) and 150 (non-essential goods) of the NIRC, as amended by RA 8424, are assembled or manufactured in the Philippines;\n\nd.3 the goods are to be delivered to a resident in the Philippines; and\n\nd.4 the goods are paid for in acceptable foreign currency and accounted for in accordance with the rules and regulations of the BSP.\n\ne. For zero-rated sale of services, verify contract to determine the person for whom the services were rendered, amount of consideration, description of the services, and examine documents evidencing actual payments. Determine if proceeds of sale in foreign currency were accounted for in accordance with the rules and regulations of the BSP. Prepare schedule with the following information: cdtai\n\n\u2022 Name of Contractee\n\n\u2022 Contract Price/Date\n\n\u2022 Amount Billed in Foreign Currency and in Pesos/Date of Billing\n\n\u2022 Amount Received in Foreign Currency\n\n\u2022 Official Receipt No./Date\n\n\u2022 Date of Receipt/Remittance\n\n\u2022 Conversion Rate\n\n\u2022 Amount Received in Pesos\n\n\u2022 Name of Accredited Bank\n\n\u2022 Bank Credit Memo No.\n\n\u2022 Billing or Receipts per Books\n\n\u2022 Discrepancy between Amount Billed and Amount Received in Foreign Currency\n\n\u2022 Discrepancy between Billing or Receipts per Books and Amount Received in Pesos\n\nC. Audit of Purchases and Input Tax\n\n1. Reconcile the amount of each category of purchases per VAT declarations and returns with the amount of purchases per subsidiary purchase journal. Check if all the information required are recorded in the purchase journal.\n\n2. Analyze and compare the summary of purchases with entries appearing in the subsidiary purchase journals, purchase journal, purchase invoices and other source documents.\n\n3. Review the composition of the purchase accounts in the journals and ledgers and ascertain that input tax credit is not recognized from the following:\n\n3.1 Purchases from non-VAT and/or exempt persons;\n\n3.2 Effectively zero-rated purchases;\n\n3.3 Purchases from VAT persons, which are personal in nature or not made in the course of trade or business;\n\n3.4 Purchases of tax-exempt goods, properties or services from VAT-registered persons although covered by VAT invoices or receipts; and\n\n3.5 Purchases of automobiles, aircrafts and yachts (Sec. 4.104-1 of RR 7-95).\n\n4. Determine compliance with substantiation on requirements of claims for input tax credit.\n\n4.1 For domestic purchases of goods, properties and services in the course of trade or business, these must be supported by VAT invoices and/or official receipts, showing the information required in Sec. 113 (A) and 237 of the NIRC, as amended by RA 8424, and Sec. 4.108-1 of RR 7-95. The printer's authority to print must likewise be indicated on the face of the invoice or receipt. A cash register machine tape shall constitute valid proof of input tax credit only if the name and TIN of the purchaser is indicated in the receipt and authenticated by a duly authorized representative of the seller.\n\n4.2 Input tax on purchases of real property should be supported by a copy of the public instrument (i.e., deed of absolute sale, deed of conditional sale, contract/agreement to sell) together with the VAT receipt issued by the seller. (Sec. 4.100-1 of RR 7-95)\n\n4.2.1 VAT official receipts issued for amortization (installment) payments, subsequent to initial down payment, on purchase of real property on \"Deferred Payment Basis\" shall not generate input tax credit. LLpr\n\n4.2.2 For sale of real property on installment plan, the computation of VAT shall be based on the actual consideration received, including interests and other charges. However, upon full payment, if the zonal/market value at the time of the initial down payment was made is higher than the total receipts/collections, then the additional VAT shall become due and payable accordingly.\n\n4.3 Credit for input tax on importation shall be supported with import entries or other equivalent documents showing actual payment of VAT on the imported goods. VAT payment must be based on the total value used by the Bureau of Customs in determining tariff and customs duties, plus customs duties, excise taxes, if any, and other charges prior to the release of the goods from customs custody, such as postage, commissions and similar charges.\n\n5. Determine correctness of computation of claims for input tax credits by multiplying the total amount indicated in the purchase invoices, and/or official receipts by one-eleventh (1/11).\n\n6. Verify actual existence of goods or properties that generate input tax credits whenever practicable and ascertain whether the same are actually used in the course of business.\n\n7. Check the authenticity of substantial claims of input tax credits by confirming purchase transactions through, but not limited to:\n\n7.1 Accessing suppliers' records;\n\n7.2 Comparing purchases of other taxpayers belonging to the same industry; and\n\n7.3 Test checking payments of representative sample of purchases against cash disbursement book/journal, check vouchers and cancelled checks.\n\n8. Ascertain that purchase returns or allowances granted to the taxpayer and input tax attributable to exempt sales results in a corresponding reduction in the input tax credit balance. (See illustration on Schedule V-5).\n\nIf a VAT-registered person is also engaged in exempt activities, determine the direct attribution of purchased goods, properties or services to taxable and exempt transactions. If purchases are directly attributable to exempt transactions, any claim for input tax credit therefor shall be disallowed. However, if the input taxes paid for purchases of goods, properties or services could not be directly attributed to either activity, the same shall be allocated between the taxable operation and the non-taxable operation using the computation shown in Schedule V-5. The amount allocated to the exempt transaction should result to corresponding reduction of input tax credit balance.\n\n9. Applications for the issuance of tax credit certificates and refund affecting the input tax credit accounts must reduce the input tax credit available at the time of application. These shall include not only applications filed with the Bureau of Internal Revenue but also those filed with the Department of Finance, the Board of Investments and the Bureau of Customs. cdll\n\n10. Reconcile the amounts of input tax claimed in the VAT return for the portion carried over from previous quarters and the balance carried to succeeding quarters with the amounts recorded in the books of accounts.\n\n10.1 In case there are discrepancies between these records, trace the sources of the discrepancies against underlying documents to detect any possible deficiency tax assessment.\n\n11. Ascertain that the recorded amount of the purchase of goods, properties or services are net of VAT.\n\n12. Verify whether the taxpayer filed amended returns or declarations covering the period under audit to preclude any possibility that the audit findings will still include transactions which were already reflected by the taxpayer in the amended returns.\n\n13. Verify the correctness of the claim for presumptive input tax, if any.\n\n13.1 Ascertain the legal basis for entitlement to the claim for presumptive input tax.\n\n13.2 Check whether the taxpayer has complied with all the administrative requirements relative to the claim pursuant to existing rules and regulations.\n\n13.3 Check the reasonableness of the value of inventories used as a basis in computing the claim for presumptive input tax. Be alert on the possibility that the taxpayer may have deliberately inflated his inventory balance to take advantage of huge presumptive input tax credit or may have included items of inventories that are not entitled to any tax credit.\n\nV-5 Illustration on Allocation of Input Tax between Taxable and Non-Taxable Operation\n\nFor instance:\n\nD. Reporting Requirements\n\nThe audit report should be brief and concise but complete in all details necessary to its understanding. It must have the following contents but not limited to:\n\n1.

                                    "Details": "This RAMO is issued as a basic guideline for the joint and coordinated examination of interrelated group of companies under Revenue Memorandum Order No. 61-98. prLL\n\n1. BACKGROUND\n\n1.1 The remarkable decrease in collection from interrelated group of companies has seriously affected the collection efforts of the Bureau. Statistics showed that while 'inter-related transaction' accounts for a big percentage of the transfer of goods and services in the country, the revenue collection from related-party groups continue to go on a downtrend.\n\n1.2 The magnitude of revenue lost has become so alarming that there is a need to immediately address this problem. It is a fact that, because these companies are more interested in their net income as a whole (rather than as individual corporations) there is a desire to minimize tax payments by taking advantage of the loopholes in our tax system and by making use of schemes that allow them to move around the law in order to reduce their tax obligations.\n\n1.3 It is therefore necessary to conduct a joint and coordinated examination of interrelated group of companies in order to identify the tax avoidance schemes and be able to prescribe the necessary measures in order to avoid the erosion of revenues.\n\n2. GENERAL GUIDELINES\n\n2.1 General Procedures. The provisions laid down in Volume 1 of the Handbook on Audit Procedures and Techniques must be followed with respect to:\n\na. Basic reportorial requirements; and\n\nb. general audit procedures and techniques.\n\n2.2 Special Audit Procedures. In addition, focus must be made on the following audit issues (detailed audit procedures are laid down in Section 3 of this RAMO ):\n\n2.2.1 Use of tax shelters (such as a foundation or a tax-exempt company) in order to avail of tax exemptions or of lower tax rates; dctai\n\n2.2.2 Shifting income and/or expenses in favor of a related company with special tax privileges (e.g. BOI Incentives, Tax Holidays, and etc.);\n\n2.2.3 Transfer pricing in inter-company supply of goods (tangible and intangible) and services;\n\n2.2.4 Inter-company loans and advances, and financing arrangements where the interest charged for the use of money is not at arm's length;\n\n2.2.5 Arbitrary cost-sharing arrangements for common expenses;\n\n2.2.6 Tax avoidance through resale and agency arrangements; and\n\n2.2.7 Thin capitalization and earning stripping.\n\n2.3 Use of Section 50 of the NIRC , as amended\n\n2.3.1 The authority for allocating income and expenses between or among related parties is laid down in Section 50 of the NIRC, as amended. This Section gives the Commissioner of Internal Revenue the authority to make allocation of income and expenses between or among controlled group of companies, if a related taxpayer has not reported its true taxable income.\n\n2.3.2 The purpose of Section 50 is to ensure that taxpayers clearly reflect income attributable to controlled transactions and to prevent the avoidance of taxes with respect to such transactions. It places a controlled taxpayer in tax parity with an uncontrolled taxpayer by determining the arm's-length price of inter-company transactions. LLphil\n\n2.4 Determination of Arm's Length Price \u2014\n\na. The method to be used in determining the arm's-length price depends on the type of transaction \u2014 whether the transaction involves a transfer of property, services, loans, advances, rentals or other arrangements. Accordingly, proper judgment must be used taking into consideration the peculiarity of the transaction and the presence of available information that would reliably determine the correct income of a controlled taxpayer.\n\nb. The different methods of determining the arm's length price of a controlled transaction under the OECD Rules on transfer pricing may be used as a reference. This includes the use of Comparable Uncontrolled Price Method, Resale Method, Cost-plus Method and Gross Profit Margin Method (these are discussed in detail in the next Section).\n\nc. In addition, the following must be considered:\n\nData and Assumptions \u2014 consider the completeness and accuracy of available data and information and the reliability of assumptions that are to be made.\n\nComparability \u2014 consider similar transactions between unrelated parties. Factors of comparability to be considered in the examination include:\n\na. Functional analysis \u2014 factors such as product design and engineering, manufacturing, production and process, marketing and distribution, advertising and etc.\n\nb. Contractual terms \u2014 this include sales and purchase agreements, volume, nature of warranties, credit and payment terms and other commercial arrangements.\n\nc. Risks \u2014 market risks including fluctuations in demand, financial risks, collection risk and commercial risks.\n\nd. Economic conditions \u2014 refers to the prevailing conditions in the market.\n\n2.5 Definition of Terms \u2014\n\n2.5.2 The term 'controlled' for purposes of this RAMO shall mean any kind of control, direct or indirect, whether legally enforceable and however exercisable or exercised. It is the reality of the control which is decisive, not its form or the mode of its exercise or ownership. A presumption of control arises if income and expenses have been arbitrarily shifted.\n\n2.5.3 The term 'controlled taxpayer' means any one or two or more organizations or trade, or businesses owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the same interests;\n\n2.5.4 The term 'true taxable income' means, the taxable income which would have been reported by the controlled taxpayer, had it in the conduct of its affairs dealt with the other member or members of the group at arm's-length. cdasia\n\n3. AUDIT PROCEDURES\n\n3.1 Transfer Pricing in interrelated supply of goods or services. This is relevant if one of the related-party enjoys certain privileges such as tax exemption, lower tax rates, incentives, or is a losing company.\n\n3.1.1 In General. \u2014 The method to be used in determining the arm's-length price of a controlled transaction shall rely primarily on the best judgment of the examiner after taking into consideration the prevailing circumstances as well as the availability of information at the time of transaction.\n\n3.1.2 As a guide, the methods under the OECD Guidelines on transfer Pricing may be used, as follows:\n\na. The comparable uncontrolled price method (CUP) \u2014 this evaluates the arm's length by reference to the amount charged in a comparable uncontrolled transaction. In evaluating comparability, consider the following:\n\n\u2022 trademark\n\n\u2022 product differences\n\n\u2022 geographical differences, and\n\n\u2022 extraordinary market conditions;\n\nb. The Resale Price Method (RPM) \u2014 it evaluates arm's length by reference to the gross profit margin realized in comparable transactions.\n\nc. The Cost Plus Method (CPM) \u2014 it evaluates the arm's-length by adding the appropriate gross profit to the controlled taxpayer's cost of producing the property involved in the controlled transaction and then impose the applicable profit rate.\n\nd. The Profit Split Method \u2014 this is done simply by dividing the profit between the members involved in the transaction taking into consideration the extent of their participation in the realization of the transaction.\n\n3.2 Loans and Advances, and financing arrangements between or among related parties\u2014\n\n3.2.1. In General. When one member of a group makes a loan or advance directly or indirectly to, or otherwise becomes a creditor of another member and either party charges an interest which is not at arm's length, there may be a tax advantage to either the lender or borrower.\n\n3.2.2 Loans and Advances may be in the form of :\n\na. Bona fide indebtedness such as loans or advances of money or other considerations;\n\nb. Indebtedness arising in the ordinary course of business from sales, leases, or the rendition of services by and between members of the group, or any other similar extension of credit;\n\nc. Alleged indebtedness\n\nFor purposes of this Section, an \"arm's length rate of interest\" is the rate of interest which would have been charged in independent transactions between unrelated parties under similar circumstances. cda\n\n3.2.3 Financing Arrangements.\n\n3.2.3.1 A common element in related-party groups is the presence of a finance company (usually a holding company) to provide financial services for the members of the group.\n\n3.2.3.2 Financial services by a holding company may range from serving as a central lender for the group, in which capacity, it may borrow funds from unrelated financial institutions and on-loan such amounts to its subsidiaries. It may also perform financial intermediary services for the group including factoring and hedging.\n\n3.2.3.3 Where one member of a group of controlled entities makes a loan or advance directly or indirectly, or otherwise becomes the creditor of another member of such group, an arm's length price for the use of money should be charged. The same is true in the case of indebtedness arising in the ordinary course of business such as sales, leases, provision of services and other similar extension of credits.\n\n3.3 Performance of Services for Another\n\n3.3.1 In general \u2014 under this scheme, one member of the group performs marketing, managerial, administrative, technical or other services for the benefit of, or on behalf of another member of the group without charge or at a charge which is not arm's-length.\n\n3.3.2 To determine the arm's length price for the service, the \"Benefit Test\" may be considered. Under this test, the direct benefit to the member which received the service must be considered. It is necessary to take into account on some reasonable basis all the costs or deductions which are directly or indirectly related to the service performed. cdrep\n\n3.3.3 Where tangible or intangible property is transferred, sold, assigned, loaned, leased or otherwise made available in any manner by one member of a group to another member of the group and services are rendered by the transferor in connection with such transfer, the services rendered in such transaction, provided it is not ancillary, must be valued.\n\n3.4 Sharing of Costs\n\n3.4.1 In general. A cost sharing arrangement is an agreement under which the parties agree to share the costs in proportion to their respective share of anticipated benefits. This is very common in joint undertaking and in expenses such as research and development, office and factory spaces, legal and consultancy services and etc.\n\n3.4.2 In determining the appropriateness of the sharing arrangement, factors such as benefits-received, size of the company, participation in the venture, and etc. should be considered.\n\n3.5 Thin Capitalization and Earning Stripping\n\n3.5.1 In General \u2014 The most common form of tax avoidance scheme using corporate structure is high-debt financing of thinly capitalized controlled company. This scheme favors debt over equity as a form of financing mainly because of tax favored treatment of interest payments compared to dividends.\n\n3.5.2 Under present laws, interest payments are fully deductible against taxable income while dividends are not. The tax advantages of interest payments in contrast to dividend is an outright savings of 35% (34%-32% under CTRP) in the form of a deductible expense against the taxable base. If interest payments are subjected to 20% Final Tax (while intercorporate dividends are at 0% tax), financing through debt rather than equity would still have an advantage equivalent to 15%.\n\n3.5.3 In the absence of rules prescribing guidelines and presumptions as to what constitute thin capitalization (unlike other countries), there is a necessity to determine the reasonable ratio of debt over equity considering all factors surrounding the case.\n\n4. EFFECTIVITY\n\nThis RAMO shall take effect immediately. cdasia\n\nBEETHOVEN L. RUALO\nCommissioner of Internal Revenue",

SCOPE\n\nThis Order outlines the procedures, guidelines and techniques in the verification of Presumptive Input Tax (PIT) claimed by taxpayers newly-covered by EVAT (RA 7716 ) and shall cover all inventories of goods, materials, supplies and improvements as of December 31, 1995 on which PIT was recognized pursuant to Section 4.112-2(a) of Revenue Regulations No. 7-95.\n\nII. OBJECTIVE\n\nTo insure the validity and correctness of claims for Presumptive Input Tax, the inventory lists of goods, materials, supplies and improvements as of December 31, 1995 filed by newly-covered taxpayers shall be subjected to test-verification following the uniform guidelines, procedures and techniques as hereinafter provided.\n\nIII. POLICIES\n\n1. All verification of PIT shall be covered by a Mission Order (Annex A) and a Letter to Taxpayer (Annex B) signed by the Revenue District Officer which shall serve as the authority of the Revenue Officer to conduct verification. Mission Orders shall be prepared in four (4) copies distributed as follows:\n\n2. All Mission Orders shall be valid only for forty-five (45) days within which the Revenue Officers shall conduct actual verification. Thereafter, a report of investigation which includes a Memorandum Report, Presumptive Input Tax Verification Report (Annex C) and a Summary Verification Report (Annex D) shall be submitted within fifteen (15) days from completion of actual verification. All reports shall be submitted to the Assessment Division for review not later than sixty (60) days from issuance of Mission Order.\n\nRevenue Officers who fail to submit the required report within the prescribed period shall submit a written justification for such failure, otherwise, necessary administrative sanctions shall be imposed upon him/her.\n\n3. The Assessment Division shall review the report of PIT verification and if approved, shall issue a Certificate of Allowable Presumptive Input Tax (CAPIT) (Annex E) to the taxpayer within ten (10) days from receipt of the report from the RDO. If disapproved, follow the same procedures under Section II(d) of RMO 37-94. The CAPIT shall reflect the amount of allowable PIT to be credited against the output tax of the taxpayer.\n\n4. All taxpayers who claimed PIT of 1 Million or more except those already verified under RMO 6-96 and RSO 137-96, shall be subjected to mandatory verification.\n\n5.

Issue CAPIT within ten (10) days from receipt of the report from the Revenue District Office. All CAPIT issued shall be numbered consecutively with the first two numbers representing the regional office number. For example, the first CAPIT issued by the Assessment Division of Revenue Region 7, Quezon City shall be numbered 07-001.\n\n3. If disallowance of PIT results to deficiency taxes, issue the corresponding Assessment Notice.\n\n4. Require xerox copy of Amended VAT Return of the taxpayer reflecting therein the correct amount of allowable PIT as appearing in CAPIT.\n\n5. Submit to the Assessment Service every 10th day of the following month list of all CAPIT issued.\n\nC. Revenue Officer\n\n1. Conduct PIT verification following the procedures outlined below:\n\n1.1 Preliminary Approach to Verification\n\nEssential to an effective audit of PIT is the familiarization of:\n\n\u2022 the business organization of the taxpayer and whether it has business establishments other than its head office;\n\n\u2022 location of warehouses, storage places, bodegas and other premises where inventories are being kept and maintained;\n\n\u2022 accounting methods and policies, including method of valuation, as well as the degree of internal control.\n\n1.2 General Audit Procedures\n\n1. Secure copies of the following documents with the revenue district office where taxpayer is registered:\n\n1.1 Inventory List as of December 31, 1995;\n\n1.2 VAT Declarations for January and February of 1996 and VAT Return for the quarter ended March 31, 1996.\n\n2. Serve the Mission Order and Letter to the taxpayer together with a checklist of the requirements which include the following:\n\n2.1 Inventory List used as basis of the 8% presumptive input tax including supporting schedules;\n\n2.2 Audited Financial Statements and Post-Closing Trial Balance as of December 31, 1995;\n\n2.3 Lapsing schedule, or schedule of periodic depreciation, if inventory list includes depreciable goods/assets;\n\n2.4 Suppliers' sales invoices and/or official receipts for items included in the inventory list;\n\n2.5 Other documents necessary in the verification of PIT.\n\n3. Verify the authenticity of inventory list submitted by taxpayers claiming PIT. Check completeness of information provided, i.e. description of items, quantity, unit cost and peso value. Check footings and extensions.\n\n4. Have access to the following records of the taxpayer.\n\n4.1 Regular books of accounts, i.e. ledgers and journals\n\n4.2 Inventory records such as stock cards or bin cards, stock records, property ledgers\n\n4.3 Other records deemed necessary in the verification of PIT.\n\n5. Review the composition of inventory list. In determining the correct basis for PIT, exclude the following:\n\n5.1 Items in the inventory which are exempt from VAT;\n\n5.1.1 tax-exempt and duty-free importation of capital equipment by taxpayers enjoying tax exemption under special laws such as EO 226 and/or EO 484;\n\n5.1.2 those falling under Section 103 of the NIRC, as amended;\n\n5.2 Goods or properties that are fully depreciated;\n\n5.3 Goods, materials and supplies purchased prior to the effectivity of EO 273, January 1, 1988;\n\n5.4 Items where taxpayer has no legal title as of December 31, 1995, i.e., goods in transit, consignment, etc.\n\n5.5 Immovable properties except improvements in the case of real estate dealers;\n\n5.6 Non-operating movable equipments or those not directly connected with the vatable operation of the taxpayer;\n\n5.7 Items in the inventory charged to costs or expenses and claimed as deductions from income prior to 1996.\n\n5.8 Items not properly supported by valid VAT invoice/receipt.\n\n5.9 In case the taxpayer is engaged in both vatable and exempt transactions, exclude the items in the inventory directly identifiable to exempt transactions. For items not directly identifiable, allocate the value of the inventory based on the amount of exempt sales reported in the income statement for the taxable year 1995, using the formula:\n\n6. Reconcile the balances of inventory accounts shown in the balance sheet against the amount appearing in the inventory list and the amount claimed per VAT Return filed with the district office. The maximum amount of PIT that can be granted should not be more than the amount appearing in the balance sheet figures. Find out if the \"Input Tax Credit\" account or any account of similar nature has been debited in the books upon recognition of PIT.\n\n7. Conduct an ocular inspection/test-count of properties and inventories of material value kept in warehouses, bodegas, offices and other areas to determine actual existence and whether it qualifies for PIT.\n\n8. Verify method of inventory valuation and costing. Ascertain if it conforms to the method prescribed in the Tax Code as implemented by Sec. 146-149 of Revenue Regulations No. 2.\n\n8.1 Materials and Supplies\n\n8.1.1 Determine the costing method employed;\n\n8.1.2 Test-check valuation of materials and supplies from suppliers' invoices, official receipts and other documents.\n\n8.1.3 Trace in the stock or bin cards the cost assigned to the stock on hand and verify the same against the inventory list;\n\n8.1.4 Verify unit cost per item selected based on last purchase invoice against unit cost per inventory list;\n\n8.1.5 Where existence of material discrepancy in the preparation of inventory list is determined, conduct a stock-taking of materials and supplies on hand. Determine the level of inventory as of December 31, 1995 by accounting for purchases and material issuances to arrive at the correct inventory level.\n\n8.2 Movable Operating Equipments\n\n8.2.1 Ascertain the acquisition cost of depreciable operating movable goods from suppliers' invoices, official receipts and other supporting documents.\n\n8.2.2 Check the depreciation policy adopted and verify if such is consistently applied. Note that a drop in depreciation rate in 1995 requires an explanation.\n\n8.2.3 Verify the accumulated depreciation as of December 31, 1995.\n\n9. Prepare audit report with all working papers and documentary evidences to support the findings. The report should be brief and concise but complete in all details. It should contain the following:\n\n9.1 Duplicate copy of Mission Order and Letter to taxpayer;\n\n9.2 VAT Declaration for the months of January and February, 1996 and VAT Return for the first quarter of 1996;\n\n9.3 Inventory List as of December 31, 1995;\n\n9.4 Audited Financial Statements as of December 31, 1995;\n\n9.5 Computation of disallowed presumptive input tax;\n\n9.6 Computation of VAT due, if any;\n\n9.7 Revenue Officers' Memorandum Report and Presumptive Input Tax Verification Report;\n\n9.8 Certificate of Allowable Presumptive Input Tax (CAPIT) for approval and signature by the Chief of Assessment Division.\n\n1.3 Audit Procedures by Industry\n\nIn addition to the procedures required in IV(C)(1.2) above, the following procedures shall also be performed depending on the industry classification of the taxpayer.\n\nA. Real Estate Dealer/Lessor\n\n1. Require submission/presentation of the following:\n\n1.1 Inventory list of properties with details as to name of project, cost, area and number of units, classified into:\n\na) Primarily held for lease, with names of tenants;\n\nb) Primarily held for sale;\n\nc) Indirectly used in the real estate business;\n\nd) Used in other lines of business;\n\n1.2 License to Develop and Sell real properties with information as to the number of units developed, classification whether low-cost, socialized regular residential or commercial/industrial units;\n\n1.3 Suppliers' and contractors' sales invoices or official receipts;\n\n1.4 Other documents necessary to establish the taxpayer's business profile i.e. Articles of Incorporation, business permits, etc.\n\n1.5 Location maps\n\n2. Identify and segregate the inventories of materials, supplies and improvements as of December 31, 1995 as to:\n\n2.1 real estate dealer i.e. buying, developing, and selling;\n\n2.2 real estate leasing;\n\n2.3 VAT-exempt transactions like low-cost and socialized housing, etc.\n\n3. Determine the composition of inventory and separate the cost of raw land from the land improvements and/or cost of construction. Disallow any PIT claimed on the cost of raw land. In determining the value of raw land, consider the acquisition cost.\n\n4. In case of joint venture agreements where the share of one party consist of land while the other party shoulders the cost of developing the land, the former party shall not be entitled to PIT with respect to the value of the land contributed to the joint venture. In cases, however, where both parties to the joint venture share in the development cost, the PIT shall be allocated to the parties in accordance with the joint venture sharing agreement.\n\n5. Conduct ocular inspection to determine existence of low-cost and socialized housing projects. Disallow PIT claimed on low-cost housing projects under B.P. 220 and socialized housing projects under R.A. 7279.\n\n6. Determine the inventory of unsold units as of December 31, 1995. If sold before January 1, 1996, determine the mode of payment. If more than 25% of the selling price has been paid as of December 31, 1995, then the property is considered sold on a deferred payment plan and therefore it should not form part of inventory. If 25% or less has been paid as of December 31, 1995, then the property is considered sold on installment and therefore should still form part of the inventory. Any PIT claimed on properties sold on deferred payment plan as of December 31, 1995 shall be disallowed.\n\n7. If cost improvement cannot be identified directly to the sold and unsold units, the PIT shall be allocated using the following formula:\n\n8. Disallow PIT claimed on properties (land and improvement) held for lease. Real estate lessors are entitled to PIT only on their inventory of goods, materials and supplies as of December 31, 1995.\n\n9. Disallow PIT claimed on improvements introduced before the effectivity of EO 273, January 1, 1988.\n\nB. Taxicabs, Tourist Bus, Rent-a-Car, and Other Common Carriers\n\n1. Identify and segregate the inventories on materials, goods and supplies as of December 31, 1995 attributable to \u2014\n\n1.1 Vatable activity i.e. carriage of cargo\n\n1.2 Non-Vatable activity i.e. carriage of passengers.\n\nPIT directly identifiable to non-vatable transactions shall be disallowed. Those which cannot be directly identified shall be allocated based on sales as reflected in the income statement for taxable year 1995.\n\n2. Determine whether movable equipments on which PIT has been claimed is directly related to the vatable activity or are considered movable operating equipments such as:\n\n2.1 Taxi units of taxi operators, buses for tourist bus operators, trucks for haulers, and other similar movable equipments. For purposes of claiming PIT, ships and airplanes are not considered movable operating equipments. Therefore, no PIT shall be allowed.\n\n2.2 Tools for repairs and maintenance.\n\n3. Check Registration Certificates to determine if taxpayer has title to the property.\n\nC. Hotels, Motels, Resorts and Restaurants\n\n1. Determine whether movable equipments on which PIT has been claimed are operating movable equipments such as: china, glasswares and silverwares; linen; uniforms; kitchen utensils; furnitures and furnishings in guestrooms, hotel outlets and lobby area; telephone, refrigerators, television sets and fax machines used in guestrooms; audio visual equipments and musical instruments used in function rooms where seminar, debut, wedding and other affairs are held; sports equipment in case of resorts. Only movable operating equipments are entitled to PIT.\n\nNon-operating movable equipments such as office equipment and business machines, micro and personal computers, housekeeping and laundry equipment, display cases and racks, health club, sports and beauty salon equipments; engineering tools and equipments, and other equipments not directly related to the business, are not entitled to PIT.\n\n2. In cases where goods or properties included in the inventory are being manufacture/processed by the taxpayer, scrutinize the cost components and exclude those which do not have VAT component i.e. labor, where service was rendered by the employees of the taxpayer, and materials, where the same were not subjected to VAT.\n\n3. In cases where a commissary in charge of purchasing, processing, warehousing as well as distributing goods to all store outlets and franchises is maintained, only the inventories in store outlets are allowed PIT.\n\nD.

Deoferio, Jr., Beethoven L. Rualo and Rene G. Banez.\n\nAcknowledgment is extended to the following for their invaluable contribution to the project: Arturo Andino, Luz Barrion, Arnel A. Bernardo, Enrique Bueno, Frederick P. Capitan, Teresita Felipe, Lucina A. Fernando, Alberto R. Paggabao, Evita M. Pantaleon, Arnulfo Romero, Marilou del Rosario, Erlinda Simple, Felix Sumbillo, Esperanza B. Tee, Samuel Veluz, Leonor S. Villalon and Tax Administration Assistance Project (TAAP) Technical Advisors, Steven Bowen, Yassie Hodges and Martin Townsend.\n\nASSESSMENT SERVICE\n\nI. Introduction\n\nA. Revenue Tax Administration\n\nThe function of the Bureau of Internal Revenue is to administer the provisions of the National Internal Revenue Code. It is the duty of the Bureau to implement the Tax Code and related laws enacted by Congress in a fair and impartial manner.\n\nThe mission of the Bureau is to enforce internal revenue laws with impartiality, courtesy and consistency, collect the correct amount of taxes at the least cost to the government and least inconvenience to the taxpayer and serve the public honestly and efficiently in a manner that will elicit the highest level of confidence in the Bureau of Internal Revenue.\n\nInvestigation supports the mission of the Bureau by enhancing a high degree of compliance and encouraging the correct reporting of income, transfer, business and other taxes. This is accomplished by:\n\na. Measuring the degree of voluntary compliance as reflected on filed returns; HITAEC\n\nb. Reducing non-compliance by identifying returns and taxpayers that need to be investigated; and\n\nc. Conducting quality audits of selected tax returns on a timely basis.\n\nThe purpose of auditing a tax return is to determine the taxpayer's correct tax liability. A quality audit is the examination of a taxpayer's books and records in sufficient depth so as to ascertain the correctness and validity of entries thereon and the propriety of application of tax laws.\n\nB. Purpose\n\nThe updated Handbook on Audit Procedures and Techniques has been prepared for all revenue officers who make field examinations of tax returns to provide him with confidence in carrying out the investigation. The purpose of the handbook is to equip the revenue officer with the necessary knowledge for the proper examination of tax returns and provide him with confidence in carrying out the investigation. This Handbook is designed to ensure that the revenue officer acquires useful auditing skills, progress from simple audit techniques to more sophisticated procedures and advance in examination procedures from a single proprietorship to a large corporation and from a simple bookkeeping accounting system to a highly sophisticated computerized system.\n\nThe revenue officer's job is to familiarize with the business activity and/or undertaking of taxpayers assigned to him for audit, evaluate the various methods and procedures used, be imaginative, inquisitive and observant and above all, use common sense.\n\nC. Contents of the Handbook\n\nThe handbook contains guides, instructions and suggestions in the conduct of audit for various taxpayers. The discussions begin with the analysis of tax returns & financial statements, familiarization with accounting methods, bookkeeping systems, books of accounts and other related records. The audit procedures for balance sheet and income statement accounts are laid out together with investigation techniques for each type of tax. This does not preclude, however, the revenue officer from carrying out other audit techniques which are deemed necessary in the circumstances surrounding a particular case.\n\nThe Handbook is not intended to provide a source of tax law or procedural doctrine nor a reference material of revenue issuances. Each revenue officer is presumed to have a working knowledge of the Tax Code, the latest amendments thereon and an update of existing revenue regulations, revenue rulings, revenue memorandum orders and other issuances.\n\nThe other contents of the handbook include documentary requirements in the investigation process and proper report making.\n\nII. Accounting Methods\n\nThe methods of accounting regularly employed by the taxpayer in keeping his books are such methods as clearly reflect his income and which are followed at the time items of gross income and deductions are to be accounted for. If the taxpayer does not regularly employ a method of accounting which reasonably shows his correct income, the computation of income shall be made in such manner as in the opinion of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue or his duly authorized representative clearly reflects it.\n\nThe methods of accounting recognized under the Tax Code are:\n\nA. Cash Basis is a method of accounting whereby all items of gross income received during the year shall be accounted for in such taxable year and that only expenses actually paid shall be claimed as deductions during the year. This method of accounting is generally used by taxpayers who do not keep books of accounts. Under this method, income is realized upon receipt of cash or its equivalent including those constructively received (such as deposits for the taxpayer's account by customers) but not including gifts or donations. Users of cash basis accounting are mostly individuals engaged in business and the practice of profession, professional partnerships and professional service organizations.\n\nB. Accrual Basis is a method of accounting for income in the period it is earned regardless of whether it has been received or not. In the same manner, expenses are accounted for in the period they are incurred and not in the period they are paid. Under this method, net income is being measured by the excess of income earned during the period over the expenses incurred. Expenses not being claimed as deductions by taxpayers in the current year when they are incurred cannot be claimed as deduction from income for the succeeding year. Thus, a taxpayer who is authorized to deduct certain of his expenses and other allowable deductions for the current year but failed to do so cannot be allowed to deduct the same for the next year. The accrual basis of accounting is being used by taxpayers whose nature of business uses inventories since this method of accounting will correctly reflect income by matching purchases and expenses against sales. This method is being applied by most medium and large corporations.\n\nC. Completion of Contract Basis is an accounting method applicable to contractors in the construction of building, installation of equipments and other fixed assets or other construction work covering a period in excess of one year.\n\nUnder this method, gross income may be reported on the taxable year in which the contract is fully completed and accepted by the contractee if the taxpayers elected it as a consistent practice to treat such income, provided that such method clearly reflects the net income. If this method is adopted there should be deducted from gross income all expenditures during the life of the contract which are properly allocated thereto, taking into consideration any materials and supplies charged to the work under the contract but remaining on hand at the time of the completion.\n\nD. Percentage of Completion Basis is a method applicable in the case of a building, installation or construction contract covering a period in excess of one year whereby gross income derived from such contract may be reported upon the basis of percentage of completion. In determining the percentage of completion of a contract, generally one of the following methods is used:\n\na. The costs incurred under the contract as of the end of the tax year are compared with the estimated total contract costs; or\n\nb. The work performed on the contract as of the end of the tax year is compared with the estimated work to be performed. HScAEC\n\nIn such case, the return should be accompanied by a certificate of the architect or engineer showing the percentage of completion during the taxable year of the entire work performed under contract. There should be deducted from such gross income all expenditures made during the taxable year on account of the contract, account being taken of the materials and supplies on hand at the beginning and end of the taxable period for use in connection with the work under the contract but not yet so applied.\n\nE. Installment Basis is a method considered appropriate when collections extend over relatively long periods of time and there is a strong possibility that full collection will not be made. As customers make installment payments, the seller recognizes the gross profit on sale in proportion to the cash collected.\n\nF. Crop Year Basis is a method applicable only for farmers engaged in the production of crops which take more than a year from the time of planting to the process of gathering and disposal. Expenses paid or incurred are deductible in the year the gross income from the sale of the crops are realized.\n\nIn relation to the foregoing accounting methods, the Tax Code provides for a tax credit system in computing the tax payable by certain taxpayers. While the tax credit system is not an accounting system, it is discussed here for the proper understanding of the computation of taxes due from taxpayers.\n\nThe tax credit system is a method used to account for the creditable taxes deducted by the withholding agents from the income payments due to certain payees (as in the case of withholding tax at source pursuant to RR 6-85) or the creditable tax added to the sales price (as in the case of value-added tax). The creditable taxes should be clearly identified in the books of the taxpayer; such as:\n\n1. Creditable income tax (asset)\n\n2. VAT input tax (asset)\n\n3. Withholding tax payable - Compensation (liability)\n\n4. Withholding tax payable - Expanded Withholding Tax (EWT) (liability)\n\n5. VAT output tax (liability)\n\nIII. Bookkeeping Systems\n\nBookkeeping may be made according to two systems, namely, (1) the single entry and (2) the double entry.\n\nThe single entry system of bookkeeping is basically a type of \"net worth\" method of arriving at net income. It records only the debit or credit of each transaction, or an account with the debtor or creditor and a simple record of cash receipts and disbursements.\n\nWhenever a system of records keeping does not include equal debit and credit to asset, liability, proprietorship, income and expense accounts, it is referred to as a \"single entry system\". The single entry is often used by comparatively simple ventures such as small retail or commission merchants, professional firms, estates and trusts. In many cases, the only record of income and deductions consists of entries on the stubs of their checkbooks. Some taxpayers maintain an income tax folder in which they place documents to support their income tax deductions.\n\nA single entry system may be merely a chronological record of transactions posted in a notebook or journal.\n\nSometimes, the records consist of a complete set of journals (cash, sales, purchases and general journal) and general ledger providing important accounts.\n\nThe accounting cycle starts with source documents (invoices, bills, paid checks, vouchers, receipts, register tapes, loan documents, bank deposit slips, and bank statements) proceeding to the cash receipts and cash disbursements journal, working paper summary and ending with the tax return.\n\nReconciliation of the taxpayer's books, working paper summary and records to the return is a very important audit step. In this way, the revenue officer will become familiar with the taxpayer's accounting system, policies and control procedures. If the records available are organized, this will lend more credibility to the tax return, but if they are inadequate, then the revenue officer should closely scrutinize the information on the income tax return. Therefore, when encountered with the lack of formal books and records, the revenue officer must use source documents and other available documents to construct the taxpayer's financial position in order to compare it with the taxpayer's standard of living and business activity.\n\nDouble Entry System \u2014 Under this system of bookkeeping, accounting recognizes the two-fold effects of every recorded event, the debit and the credit or the object of the event and the equitable interest in that object. Every recorded event affecting one side must necessarily affect the other side. This can be presented in an equation:\n\nAssets = Liabilities + Capital\n\nThis can be analyzed into its component elements which show that there are two distinct parties that have rights in the assets of the business, the creditors and the owners. The rights of the creditors are the claims of such creditors on the assets of the business which are referred to as liabilities and the rights of the owners on the business are referred to as capital.\n\nIn the double entry method, any net increase and net decrease in asset has a corresponding increase and decrease in either liabilities or capital.\n\nAudit of accounting records under this system shall be detailed as presented in the following discussions of audit of real and nominal accounts.\n\nIV. Accounting Records\n\nTaxpayers are required by law and regulation to keep and maintain accounting records in sufficient detail to enable them to make a proper return of income. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue is authorized to examine such records or other data which may be relevant material for the purpose of ascertaining the correctness of the tax returns. The books and records kept must be sufficient to establish the amount of the gross income and the deductions, credits and other matters required to be shown in the tax return.\n\nThe primary records commonly used by all types of businesses, considering the accounting systems and reporting methods of the business are those documents such as invoices, vouchers, bills, receipts and other source documents which are also the supporting documents in the selling and buying of merchandise, services and assets used in the business. For companies which require the use of inventories, the primary records include the detailed inventory list. Other primary records used in financial transactions are the cancelled checks, duplicate deposit slips bank statements and notes. HcDaAI\n\nThe secondary records, regardless of the accounting method used by the taxpayer include permanent books and working papers which summarize and list the individual documents including adjustments, when necessary. These records are properly classified in such a way that the taxpayer will determine the financial status of his business in a given period of time and the profit and loss for the period.\n\nAll records required to be kept by the taxpayers should be preserved by them for proper administration of any internal revenue law.\n\nBelow are the accounting records being used by taxpayers:\n\nA. Journal is a book of original entry in which transactions affecting the business of a taxpayer are recorded consecutively day by day as they occur.\n\nJournal consists of the following:\n\na. Sales Journal. This is a book whereby sales an account are recorded which are supported by sales invoices and which are also the documents that will serve as the basis of recording the transactions in the books of accounts.\n\nCash sales are usually recorded in the cash book although it may be posted in both books representing a debit to cash in the cash book and a credit to sales in the sales book.\n\nEvery entry in the sales journal represents a debit to a customer's account and a credit to sales to be posted in the general ledger.\n\nSales returns and allowances are also recorded in the sales book which represents a debit to Sales Returns and Allowances and a credit to Accounts Receivable to be posted in the general ledger. This would mean a decrease in Sales and eventually a decrease in an asset account.\n\nb. Purchase Journal. This is a book used to record exclusively all transactions involving the purchase or acquisition of merchandise on account. The business document that serves as evidence of a purchase transaction is the purchase invoice.\n\nAn entry to record charge purchases is a debit to Purchases and a credit to Accounts Payable to be posted in the general ledger.\n\nPurchase returns and allowances are also recorded in this book and posted in the general ledger representing a debit to Accounts Payable and a credit to Purchase Returns and Allowances which would mean a decrease in the purchases account.\n\nIn certain instances such as where the volume of business is large under the value-added tax system, taxpayers maintain subsidiary sales and purchase journals where details of daily sales and purchases are recorded.\n\nc. Cash Book is a book whereby all transactions involving cash whether cash receipts or cash disbursements are recorded.\n\nUnder this book are the following:\n\nc.1. Cash receipts book \u2014 a book whereby all transactions involving cash receipts of whatever source are recorded.\n\nc.2. Cash disbursements book \u2014 a book whereby all transactions involving cash or check disbursements are recorded.\n\nB. Ledger is a book of final entry to which are posted the classified accounts or items of all transactions entered in the journal. All entries in the journal must be posted to the ledger and shall be classified in the ledger so as to show the assets, liabilities, capital and the operating accounts from which a balance sheet and a profit and loss statement covering the operation of the business can be prepared. No entry shall be made in the ledger unless said entry originates from the journal.\n\nThe accounts contained in the general ledger provide the revenue officer with insight into the operations of the business. When pertinent, the chart of accounts should be requested from the taxpayer. If a private ledger is maintained, it should also be requested.\n\nAs the revenue officer goes through the ledger, unusual or non-recurring items should be noted and verified. Most of these items are classified as follows:\n\na. Unusual in amount \u2014 The revenue officer should be alert for month-end entries with significant amounts which may affect income and expenses.\n\nb. Unusual by source \u2014 source means the books of accounts from where the entry to the ledger account originates. Hence, expenses or adjustments to income which do not ordinarily originate from the cash journals, sales and purchase books should be investigated. Such adjustments originating from the general journal or journal vouchers should be thoroughly examined as to supporting documents and proper authorization.\n\nc. Unusual by nature \u2014 An entry in a ledger account may be unusual by nature as well as by an account itself. Accounts with abnormal balances such as receivable accounts with credit balances may indicate income which is credited to receivables instead of sales. Unusual accounts such as suspense, other receivables and due to stockholders and such other unusual liability accounts should be analyzed as there may be income components lodged in these accounts. EISCaD\n\nC. Subsidiary Book. In the general ledger, accounts are usually transferred and grouped into certain accounts to a subsidiary book. This general ledger account is called control account. Control accounts in the general ledger contain summarized information that is recorded in detail in a subsidiary book or ledger. It is therefore the control account which contains summarized information and the subsidiary ledger contains the same information but in detail.\n\nThus, in order to relieve the general ledger of too many individual accounts, business concerns having numerous accounts with customers and creditors will transfer said accounts to separate ledgers \u2014 one for customers and another for creditor's. For example, the control account for the customer's subsidiary book will be called \"Accounts Receivable\", while the control account for the creditors' subsidiary book will be called \"Accounts Payable\".\n\nAll corporations, companies, partnerships or persons required by law to pay internal revenue taxes have the option to keep this kind of book depending on the need of their business, provided that where such subsidiaries are kept, they shall form part of the accounting records of the taxpayer and shall be subject to the same rules and regulations as to their keeping, translation, production and inspection as are applicable to the journal and the ledger.\n\nD. Computerized Accounting System. This method of accounting is now being used by most companies. It is a system whereby information are fed into the computer thus providing uniformity in the processing of transactions.\n\nTypes of System under this method:\n\na. Simple System. Transactions are easily traced in a small computer system where the primary function performed is the sorting and manipulation of input data and the printing of output reports. There is no loss of audit trail. Audit of this type of system requires little training and background in Information Systems (IS).\n\nAn example of this type of system are shipping data that are encoded and processed throughout the system along with accounts receivable ledgers. The output is a multicopy sales invoice for each sale, an updated subsidiary ledger and a sales journal.\n\nb. Complex System. This is characterized by the batch processing mode, the existence of one Central Processing Unit (CPU) and the extensive use of master files on magnetic media in processing. In this type of system, processing is usually confined to calculations, extensions, summarizations and the like. There is some loss of audit trail but the same is not significant. The audit of such system can be done by auditors with limited specialized training in IS auditing. Because of the extent of a printed audit trail, the auditors have the option of performing audit tests with or without the use of the computer based on his experience.\n\nc. Sophisticated System. In this type of system, transactions are initiated within the computer. There is extensive data processing and consequently, a substantial loss of audit trail. Most of the output is in machine-readable form.\n\nHeavy reliance must be placed on internal control in the audit of said system. Since many of these tests require IS skills beyond the knowledge of most auditors, IS specialists are usually called upon by the auditors. Careful advance planning is necessary because records needed in audit and the approach to be used in testing must be made before data are processed.\n\nV. Accounting Periods\n\nAccounting periods are classified into two, they are:\n\n1. Calendar year; and\n\n2. Fiscal year.\n\nCalendar year \u2014 is an accounting period which starts from January 1 and ends on December 31. This is generally used by most taxpayers who elect the calendar year as their accounting period. However, the calendar year shall be the basis of computing the net income in the following cases:\n\na. when the taxpayer is an individual;\n\nb. when the taxpayer does not keep books of accounts; and\n\nc. when the taxpayer has no annual accounting period.\n\nFiscal Year \u2014 is an accounting period for twelve months ending on the last day of any month other than December.\n\nCorporations and duly registered general co-partnerships are allowed to use this type of accounting period.\n\nA taxpayer may have a taxable period of less than twelve (12) months in the following cases:\n\na. When a corporation is newly organized;\n\nb. When a corporation changes its accounting period;\n\nc. When a corporation is dissolved;\n\nd. When the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, by authority, terminates the tax period of a taxpayer; and\n\ne. In case of final return for the decedent.\n\nChange in Accounting Period \u2014 An individual cannot change his accounting period from the calendar year to the fiscal year. He is only allowed to use the calendar year.\n\nThe corporation and general co-partnership have the option to choose between the calendar year and the fiscal year.\n\nThe application for a change in accounting period should be filed in writing with the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, through the Revenue District Office, within thirty (30) days prior to the date fixed for filing of the return on the basis of the original accounting period designating therein the proposed date for the closing of its new taxable year.\n\nVI. Financial Statements\n\nFinancial Statements are reports signifying the end product of the financial accounting process. These reports are as follows:\n\nA. Income Statement \u2014 it is a report that summarizes the business activities for a given period and reports the net income or loss resulting from operations and from certain other activities. It is variously called the earnings statement, the statement of profit and loss and the statement of operations. It normally consists of the following sections or items:\n\na. Sales \u2014 reports the total sales to customers and fees received from clients for the period. Transactions deemed sale, except goods out for consignment, must have been properly recorded as sales. All sales transactions should be recorded and invoiced.\n\nb. Cost of goods sold \u2014 refers to cost of goods relating to sales when merchandise is acquired from outsiders. This is the sum of the beginning inventory, purchases and all other buying, freight and storage costs relating to the acquisition of goods and subtracting the ending inventory thereof. When the goods are manufactured by the seller, the cost of goods manufactured must first be calculated. This is the sum of the cost of goods in process at the beginning, the cost of materials put into production, the cost of labor applied and factory overhead incurred. The total cost as thus obtained represents the cost of both completed work and uncompleted work still in production. The ending goods in process inventory, then, must be subtracted from this total in arriving at the cost of the product completed and made available for sale.\n\nc. Operating expenses \u2014 are expenses incurred or utilized in the course of business or pursuant to the practice of profession. They are generally reported in two categories:\n\na. selling expenses and\n\nb. general and administrative expenses.\n\nIn case of self employed individual taxpayers, professionals, non-resident aliens, estates and trusts engaged in trade or business, general professional partnerships and their individual partners, expenses claimed are subject to the provisions of RR 2-93.\n\nd. Other Income and Expenses \u2014 include items identified with financial management and miscellaneous recurring activities. Other income include interest and dividend income and income from rentals, royalties and service fees. Other expenses include interest expense and expenses related to the miscellaneous income items reported.\n\nB. Balance Sheet \u2014 is a report that shows the financial position of the business unit as of a specified moment of time. It is a status report rather than a flow report. It is variously called statement of financial position, statement of condition, statement of resources and liabilities and the statement of net worth.\n\nThe balance sheet is the fundamental accounting statement in the sense that every accounting transaction can be analyzed in terms of its effect on the balance sheet. In order to understand the information a balance sheet conveys and how economic events affect the balance sheet, it is essential that the reader be absolutely clear as to the meaning of its two sides, the equation DSHTaC\n\nASSETS = LIABILITIES + OWNER'S EQUITY\n\na. Assets \u2014 are economic benefits obtained or controlled by a particular entity as a result of past transactions or events. They include those costs that have not been matched with revenues in the past and are expected to afford economic utility in the production of revenues in the future. It includes both monetary assets, such as cash, marketable securities and receivables and non-monetary assets, those costs recognized as recoverable and hence properly assignable to revenues of future periods, such as inventories, prepaid insurance, equipment and patents.\n\nb. Liabilities \u2014 measure the claims of creditors against entity resources. The method for settlement of liabilities varies. Liabilities may call for settlement by cash payment or settlement through goods to be delivered or services to be performed.\n\nc. Owner's Equity \u2014 is the residual interest in the assets of an entity that remains after deducting its liabilities. It measures the interest of the ownership group in the total resources of the enterprise. Such equities originally arise as the result of contributions by the owners and the equities change with the change in net assets resulting from operations.\n\nVII. Purpose and Standards of Audit\n\nThe basic purpose of tax examination is the determination of correct taxable income as defined by the National Internal Revenue Code and the determination of the correct income and other internal revenue tax liabilities of the person or entity whose return is being examined.\n\nIn making the examination, the revenue officer's responsibility is two-fold: to the taxpayer and to the Philippine Government. Minimum standards of examination may be extended beyond the originally intended scope, or beyond minimum requirements because of situations or facts not apparent at the outset. The amount of verification to be done in any single tax examination is a matter of auditing judgment for which no rigid guide can be established.\n\nThe degree of checking or scope of a tax examination may be influenced by an analysis of the taxpayer's accounting procedures and the results achieved thereby insofar as they evidence the credibility of the records and the degree of the existing system of internal control of the taxpayer.\n\nStandard refers to the criteria by which the quality of performance of auditing examinations are measured.\n\nA. General Standards\n\na. An impartial mental attitude must be maintained in all affairs relating to an examination in order to assure a fair application of tax laws, regulations and rulings.\n\nb. Professional skill and ingenuity must be exercised in the performance of the examination and the preparation of the report.\n\nc. Issues should be raised only when in the revenue officer's opinion they have real merit and only when they will contribute in the proper determination of tax liability.\n\nd. The confidential nature of all information pertaining to any assignment must be rigidly observed.\n\nB. Standards Of Preliminary Planning\n\na. Sound judgment should be exercised in selecting from assigned returns those which are most likely to contain areas of non-compliance and, where otherwise permissible, survey procedures should be employed to dispose of those which do not warrant further consideration.\n\nb. Advance planning of work schedules with reasonable accuracy is essential for the effective use of time.\n\nc. A general work plan should be formulated in each case prior to contacting the taxpayer which includes the development of issues suggested by the return and other information. The following steps may be included in the work plan:\n\nc.1. Prepare a list of items which suggest a need for special consideration.\n\nc.2. A list of questions to be asked from the taxpayer.\n\nc.3 A list of other agencies or offices where the revenue officer can have access to their records if the taxpayer cannot present the documents requested.\n\nC. Standards of Field Work\n\na. Audits should normally be performed at the taxpayer's place of business because of the accessibility of the books and records and to permit actual observation of taxpayer's facilities and scope of operation. Otherwise, it should be performed in the office of the Bureau of Internal Revenue.\n\nb. The use of accounting skills, tax knowledge and ingenuity should be directed toward recognizing and raising issues which relate to non-compliance areas.\n\nc. Adequate evidential matter should be obtained through inspection, observation, inquiry, analysis and documentation to afford a reasonable basis for consideration of each issue with regard to the position of both the Government and the taxpayer.\n\nd. The position taken with respect to each issue should be supported by adequate authority.\n\nD. Standards Of Reporting\n\na. Reports are to be prepared in a complete, clear, concise, and legible manner in order that they may be easily read and understood.\n\nb. Working papers should be legible, in the revenue officer's own handwriting, properly headed, indexed, signed and arranged in a logical and orderly manner.\n\nc. Working papers should be used as a practical and professional tool to aid the revenue officer in the discussion of issues or questions with the taxpayer or his authorized representative. It also generally provides a record of the audit procedures undertaken by the revenue officer.\n\nE. Standards of Public Relations\n\na. Initial contact for audit arrangements should be made with the taxpayer and care should be exercised in explaining the type of records required.\n\nb. Revenue Officers must be fully cognizant of the proper sources for gathering information and of the rights of the taxpayer and his representatives.\n\nc. Necessary time and patience should be devoted to a discussion of any proposed adjustments to ensure that the taxpayer has a proper understanding of the issues.\n\nd. Tact and discretion are required in pointing out errors in books and records in order to avoid discrediting an employee or representative of the taxpayer. cAISTC\n\nVIII. Preliminary Approach To Examination\n\nA. Pre-Audit Analysis Of Return\n\nAnalysis of the return is essential to an effective audit. Preliminary analysis is used to identify potential issues which will be developed further after contacting the taxpayer. All information contained in any attachment to the tax return should be thoroughly and completely scrutinized to ascertain whether or not all of the information is adequately reflected on the tax return. Before contacting the taxpayer the revenue officer should familiarize himself with the following:\n\na. The business organization of the taxpayer and whether it has business establishments other than its main or head office;\n\nb. The location of the business and its branches as this has a relation to the volume of business;\n\nc. The economic activity in which the taxpayer is engaged in;\n\nd. The accounting books and records that would ordinarily be kept;\n\ne. The accounting methods and policies and the degree of internal control;\n\nf. The overall composition of the tax return;\n\ng. The types of income reported;\n\nh. The reasonableness of deductions;\n\ni. Unusual or unfamiliar items;\n\nj. Apparently questionable or unallowable items;\n\nk. Gross profit and selling expense percentage as well as significant variations between prior and current years;\n\nl. Inconsistencies between items and also in the treatment with respect to bad debts, inventory valuation methods, depreciation rates methods, etc.;\n\nm. Prior year's entries in the reconciliation schedules of retained earnings on a corporate return and of a partner's capital account in a partnership return which affect the year under examination;\n\nn. The status of the retained earnings account as well as basis of assets and depreciation allowed or allowable; and\n\no. The report of the tax liabilities of the taxpayer for the immediately preceding period in order to be aware of the deficiencies that were reported. Review of prior year's examination records will clarify some doubts or questions in the revenue officer's mind regarding certain items or bring light to situations that otherwise would have remained concealed on the basis of the return alone.\n\nB. Work Planning\n\nWork properly planned achieves good results.\n\na. Returns or cases where the statute of limitations is about to prescribe should be given first priority. Prescriptive period is three (3) years counted from the date prescribed by law for the filing of the return, provided that in case a return is filed beyond the prescribed period, the three-year period shall be counted from the day the return was filed.\n\nb. Claims for refund should be given the next priority in order to develop good BIR-taxpayer relationship.\n\nc. Cases assigned for reinvestigation should follow.\n\nd. Returns which would be more productive in point of revenues should be given precedence over the less productive ones.\n\nIn work planning, an Audit Program should be prepared for each and every case. An Audit Program is a checklist of the various auditing procedures to be undertaken and the various books of accounts, records, documents and business forms to be verified in order to assess the correct tax due from a taxpayer. This checklist would serve as a guide for the revenue officer to conduct a \"Quality Audit\" within the time frame allowed to conclude a tax audit. It is also a tool of the tax administrators to check on the progress of the tax audit and for proper evaluation of the performance of the revenue officer.\n\nC. Contact With Taxpayer\n\na. Arranging for an appointment.\n\nA telephone or a personal call by the revenue officer should be made to the taxpayer and not to his representative.\n\nb. Serving of Letter of Authority\n\nb.1. On the first opportunity of the revenue officer to have personal contact with the taxpayer, he should present the Letter of Authority together with a copy of the Taxpayer's Bill of Rights. The LA should be served by the revenue officer assigned to the case and no one else. He should have the proper identification card and should be in proper attire.\n\nb.2. A Letter of Authority (LA) authorizes or empowers a designated revenue officer (RO) to examine, verify and scrutinize a taxpayer's books and records in relation to internal revenue tax liabilities for a particular period.\n\nb.3. A Letter of Authority must be served or presented to the taxpayer within 30 days from its date of issue, otherwise, it becomes null and void unless revalidated and the taxpayer has all the right to refuse its service if presented beyond the 30-day period. Revalidation is done by serving a new Letter of Authority. AaIDCS\n\nc. Request for Accounting Records\n\nThe revenue officer should clearly specify the records he desires to be assembled for his examination. Among the books and records that may be required are:\n\nc.1. receipts\n\nc.2. invoices\n\nc.3. vouchers\n\nc.4. bills\n\nc.5. contracts\n\nc.6. journals\n\nc.7. ledgers\n\nd. Initial Interview\n\nThe initial interview is the most important part of the examination process and should be conducted in all audits.\n\nRequest should be made for a personal interview with the taxpayer himself. The interrogation should be so conducted as to encourage the taxpayer to contribute willingly useful information which will assist in the proper determination of his tax liability. The information developed by this method will determine the eventual outcome of the case. The preliminary interview should, as far as practicable, cover the following:\n\nd.1. Discussion of sources of income \u2014 This may uncover possible sources of income which has not been reported such as interests on investments and deposits, dividends, rents, sales of properties as well as information on financial history and standard of living.\n\nd.2. Records kept for each source of income;\n\nd.3. Handling and recording of cash transactions;\n\nd.4. Records of loans from banks and/or loans to others;\n\nd.5. Real or personal properties bought or sold in current year;\n\nd.6. Correctness of personal and additional exemptions claimed; and\n\nd.7. Other items that would be relevant in the examination, to wit:\n\nd.7.1. The responsible officers of the firm in order to facilitate acquisition of information/data;\n\nd.7.2. Place and time of audit;\n\nd.7.3. Ocular inspection of the factory, branches, outlets, etc.;\n\nd.7.4. Officers to whom the tax audit findings will be discussed;\n\nd.7.5. Financial history and standard of living of the owner/owners.\n\nD. Preliminary Evaluation Of Miscellaneous Records\n\nThe investigation on the taxpayer's office may begin with miscellaneous records other than accounting ledgers and journals. Mostly, scrutiny of these records may reveal items which the revenue officer should take into consideration as the examination progresses. The records and information to be obtained are the following:\n\na. Minute Book\n\nThe review of the minute book should not be confined to the taxable year under audit but should cover at least some period immediately before or after. As the revenue officer scans the minute book, he should note appropriate transactions and items of significance, such as contracts entered into by the taxpayer, stock issuance, dividend declaration and compensation of officers.\n\nb. Stock Transfer Book\n\nThis book contains the names of stockholders, past and present, with the number of shares cancelled and issued. This book is vital also in computing documentary stamp tax liabilities. A general knowledge of the names of large shareholders is also of value when checking the salary expense. When the stock and transfer book is not available, the record of dividend payment is an alternative source of similar information.\n\nc. Partnership agreement\n\nA copy of the partnership agreement should be obtained and certain provisions affecting partner's salaries, profit and loss sharing, interest on capital, other allowances and other matters which may have tax consequences should be noted.\n\nd. Audit report of independent auditors\n\nThe revenue officer should read the auditor's report accompanying the financial statements. Sometimes, revenue officers fail to evaluate the auditor's report. However, there are cases when auditors do not issue an unqualified opinion. Any qualification or unusual comments in the auditor's report or certificate such as expression of opinion as to taxpayer's depreciation policy, inventory and cost valuation, adequacy of reserves, status of collectibility of receivables and the like should be noted for consideration and should be related to the examination of accounts.\n\nIn cases where the auditor issues two reports, one for management and the other for attachment to the tax return, the former should be studied and compared with the latter. Income and net worth in both reports may differ from income and net worth per books due to the auditor's adjusting entries not reflected in the books. Thus, the adjusting entries and supporting documents should be examined. If needed, the auditor's working papers should be looked into to explain these entries.\n\ne. Auditor 's working papers\n\nAudits, particularly of large companies, may frequently be simplified and facilitated, if the examining revenue officers are given access to the auditor's working papers. Where necessary, authorization from the taxpayer or requests for access to said working papers signed by duly authorized officials shall be secured to be able to scrutinize the working papers of auditors, particularly the year-end adjustments, intercompany transactions, nature of receivables and other peculiar accounts. TCAHES\n\nf. Statements and schedules filed with government regulatory agencies\n\nCertain taxpayers are required to file financial statements and other reports with government bodies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission for corporate taxpayers, the Garments and Textile Export Board for garments exporters, the Board Of Investments for exporters and other similar government offices. The revenue officer should compare the statements filed with the Bureau of Internal Revenue against those filed with other government offices Any discrepancy should be inquired into and material differences should undergo an in-depth investigation.\n\ng. Appraisal reports\n\nAppraisal reports, particularly real estate appraisals, are important in many cases such as for estate tax valuation of properties, capita] gains tax verification and donor's tax investigation.\n\nE. Initial Examination Techniques\n\na. Understanding the taxpayer's books and records.\n\nOne technique that should be commonly used is for the revenue officer to interview the taxpayer or his representative to walk him through the book recording of a sale, purchase and expense transaction and to have a thorough understanding of the taxpayer's accounting system and records.\n\nb. Reconciliation -of books and returns.\n\nAnother step in understanding the records is to perform a reconciliation of the books with the return. The following actions are recommended to assist the revenue officer in the reconciliation process:\n\nb.1. Request for a Chart of Accounts and identify account numbers and account titles.\n\nb.2. Identify unusual accounts.\n\nb.3. Scan the general ledger to pursue unusual account entries.\n\nb.4. Ask the taxpayer for the tax working papers or any other type of working papers that were used to prepare the return.\n\nIf the working papers are in the hands of the external auditor, the taxpayer should be advised to secure a copy thereof from their auditor.\n\nIf no working papers are available, request the taxpayer to prepare the reconciliation and supporting schedules used to arrive at the reconciliation.\n\nb.5. Inspect the Statement of Changes in Financial Position, if the taxpayer has one, to identify sales and purchases of fixed assets, investments made and disposed, loan and debt payments, capital contributions and other transactions that might not be readily apparent on the balance sheet and income statement.\n\nc. Performance of compliance tests.\n\nThe revenue officer should establish the level of reliance that can be laced on the books and records and determine whether the books show all the transactions which occurred.\n\nTo accomplish this, a compliance test should be performed on some transactions through the backward approach and the forward approach as follows:\n\nc.1. In the backward approach, the figures per tax return are traced to the trial balance, then to the general ledger, the various journals and ultimately to the source documents such as sales invoice or official receipt.\n\nc.2. In the forward approach, the revenue officer should select a supporting document, say a sales invoice, and trace it through the sales journal, general ledger, trial balance and finally to the tax return. The backward approach is effective in checking unsupported expenses while the forward approach is used in uncovering unreported income.\n\nd. Analysis of adjusting journal entries.\n\nIt is important that the revenue officer understands adjusting journal entries because tax issues are frequently discovered in the adjusting journal entries. These adjusting journal entries are usually accruals, deferrals, corrections or reclassification of accounts.\n\nd.1. Accruals are normally entries to record certain known and fixed amount obligations or liabilities. Accruals are also used to book uncertain, contingent liabilities. Contingent liabilities are not fixed in amount or date and are not deductible for tax purposes.\n\nd.2. Deferrals are typically used to defer or postpone recognition of income or expenses. An inspection of the deferred income account may reflect amounts representing services already performed. It may also show goods already shipped and received by the customer. In both of these situations, a referral of income is not proper. IEDaAc\n\nd.3. Corrections of prior year's earnings, other adjustments and reclassifications are made through adjusting journal entries which are recorded in the general journal or in the journal vouchers. Usually, these entries are taken from the auditor's working papers.\n\nThe examining revenue officer should scrutinize these entries, specially those credited directly to retained earnings, analyze the tax issues involved and note down possible-tax assessments.\n\nd.4. Also, when scanning adjusting journal entries, the following should be looked into closely:\n\nd..4.1 Unusual, nonrecurring entries.\n\nd..4.2 Entries reducing assets as there could possibly be unreported gain on sale, incorrectly computed gain on sale, incorrectly computed installment sale, non-taxable exchange or withdrawal of goods by the owner.\n\nd..4.3 Entries increasing liabilities as these could represent fictitious or contingent liabilities, fictitious expenses, invalid loans to shareholders or undeclared income credited to liability accounts.\n\nF. Evaluation Of Internal Control\n\nInternal Control is a system of procedures in place to ensure that all business transactions are properly recorded and assets are adequately safeguarded.\n\nIt is mandatory for the revenue officer to evaluate internal control to decide to what extent the system can be relied upon, which in turn determines the nature, extent and timing of audit tests to be applied in the examination and to plan subsequent audit procedures.\n\na. Principles of Internal Control\n\nGood internal control assures good record keeping and the inability of the employees and the owner from misappropriating the assets.\n\nSome broad principles of internal control are:\n\na.1. Responsibilities should be clearly established.\n\na.2. Adequate records should be maintained.\n\na.3. Assets should be insured and employees bonded.\n\na.4. Record keeping and custody should be separated.\n\na.5. Responsibility for related transactions should be divided.\n\na.6. Personnel should be rotated. cCaIET\n\na.7. Automation should be used whenever practical.\n\na.8. Employees should be informed of prescribed procedures.\n\na.9. The system should be under constant review.\n\nb. Elements of Internal Control\n\nInternal control can be divided into three elements:\n\nb.1. Control environment\n\nThis includes the entity's organizational structure, methods of assigning authority and responsibility, engagement in related party transactions and compliance with various laws.\n\nb.2. Accounting system\n\nThis consists of the methods and records established to capture financial transactions such as sales, purchases, investments and payment of expenses and liabilities. This element is important to the revenue officer for him to understand how transactions are initiated and recorded and to determine the degree of reliability to be placed in the taxpayer's books and records.\n\nb.3. Control procedures\n\nThese include the adequate use of documents to ensure the proper recording, valuation and timing of transactions. Reconciliations of accounts should be done periodically and management should review reports for accuracy and completeness.\n\nc. Standard Procedures in Evaluating Internal Control\n\nTo establish the scope of the audit and degree of compliance tests to be performed, internal control should first be evaluated based on the following techniques:\n\nc.1. Identify the personnel responsible for record keeping and determine their responsibilities and authority in the business operation.\n\nc.2 Reconcile the return with the books and records. Difficulty in reconciling the return with the books and records may be an indication of inadequate internal control in either financial or tax accounting.\n\nc.3. Interview responsible company personnel and observe business operations .\n\nc.4. Review the chart of accounts and identify unusual accounts or note those accounts which should be included but are absent.\n\nc.5. Secure and study copies of operating manuals or instructional booklets that may lead to an easy understanding of the taxpayer's business operations.\n\nc.6. Determine if the taxpayer's personal transactions are segregated from business operations or if separate bank accounts are maintained by the owner and the business.\n\nc.7. Determine if bank accounts are reconciled monthly.\n\nc.8. Determine the books and records maintained and the frequency of recording transactions.\n\nc.9. Determine if pre-numbered documents are being used.\n\nc.10. Determine the extent of involvement of auditors and other third parties in the business.\n\nc.11. Determine if certified audits for any reason were prepared. If so, copies of these documents should be secured.\n\nc.12. Determine if the income reported by the taxpayer reflects his lifestyle.\n\nThe effective evaluation of internal control is dependent upon a very good interview, observation of the business operation and testing of the system.\n\nG. Sampling Techniques\n\nSampling is a large and important part of the examination of a tax return. It is the application of examination procedures to less than 100% of the items in an account to evaluate its accuracy.\n\na. Two Basic Types of Sampling\n\na.1. Statistical sampling\n\na.2. Judgmental sampling\n\nIn selecting accounts and transactions to be tested, judgmental sampling should be applied as it involves the use of professional judgment in planning and performing the sampling and analyzing the results. ASDCaI\n\nJudgmental sampling may include any or both of the following methods:\n\na.2.1. Block sampling \u2014 uses groups of continuous items selected from an account balance or class of transactions. An example is a revenue officer's decision to sample one month of travel expense to reach a conclusion for the year.\n\na.2.2. Peso limitation sampling or cut-off sampling \u2014 selects a minimum peso amount and transactions in excess of the said amount are verified.\n\nb. Factors to be Considered in Planning the Sample\n\nb.1. Internal Control\n\nThe extent of sampling to be done is dependent on the degree of internal control. Thus, a small sample size is required if internal control can be greatly relied upon.\n\nb.2. Accounting System\n\nLarge errors or high frequency of errors in the accounting system may require a large sample size.\n\nb.3. Materiality\n\nIn choosing appropriate material limits, the absolute size of an item, the relative size and the nature of the business and industry/business practice should be considered. Materiality of an item should be related to its tax consequence.\n\nb.4. Analytical Review\n\nIn analytical review, the following considerations should be studied:\n\nb.4.1. Taxpayer's standard of living TcDIEH\n\nb.4.2 Interest in closely held companies\n\nb.4.3. Transactions between related parties\n\nb.4.4. Transactions involving questions of fraud\n\nb.4.5 Significant increases or decreases in taxable income from year to year\n\nb.4.6. Significant adjustments on previous revenue officer's reports\n\nc. Sampling Techniques to be Applied in Testing Accounts and Transactions\n\nThere are as many sampling techniques as there are cases. The revenue officer is not precluded from discovering and applying new techniques as may be needed in each particular case.\n\nListed below are the suggested sampling techniques in testing income statement and balance sheet items:\n\nc.1. Select the first and last months of sales to ensure that income was not deferred to an improper year.\n\nc.2. The last month of the period under examination should be tested because of the likelihood of errors and unallowable adjustments made before the end of the year.\n\nc.3. Selection of the largest three months of an expense account may reveal expenses that should be capitalized, personal expenses or padded expenses.\n\nc.4. Scan the cash disbursements journal and general ledger for unusual or very large entries. This step also familiarizes the revenue officer with the accounts, payees, suppliers and clients of the taxpayer.\n\nc.5. Select at least one month's (or one week for a large corporation) issuance of cancelled checks.\n\nThoroughly analyze each check together with the endorsement at the back. This could lead to the discovery of fictitious payees, unusual transactions, personal items charged to expense and other potential disallowances.\n\nc.6. Inspection of the corporate minutes and the articles of incorporation could lead to a revenue officer's determination to sample a particular account.\n\nc.7. Examine certain accounts in the income statement in relation to the balance sheet accounts. Thus, Accounts Receivable should be analyzed together with Sales, Bad Debts Expense should be verified together with the Allowance for Bad Debts. Likewise, Accounts Payable should be examined together with Purchases and other related expenses.\n\nc.8. Test check source documents and related transactions by considering the persons involved, nature of the contract, mode of payment and other important aspects.\n\nc.9. Rounded figures should be checked as they may be estimates.\n\nc.10. Utilize results of analytical review in selecting the sample.\n\nc.11. Contract or limit the scope of the sample if the majority of the samples are completed and there are still no discrepancies.\n\nd. Examining the Sample Items\n\nThe sample items, as selected, should be verified as follows:\n\nd.1. Analyze and determine the validity of the source documents.\n\nd.2. Examine collaborating documents.\n\nd.3. Check with third parties.\n\nd.4. Inspect and observe inventory flow, fixed assets acquired, sales transaction and other transactions which may require ocular inspection.\n\ne. Analyzing the Results\n\nAnalyzing the results of a sample is an important yet commonly missed step. The sample taken should be evaluated and considered in relation to any peculiar situation, such as related party transactions or economically unsound transactions. One example would be purchases made at unusually high or low prices.\n\nIf the results of the sampling indicates potential tax assessment, an in-depth analysis should be conducted as follows:\n\ne.1. Verify the account showing the discrepancy or possible source of tax deficiency. cADaIH\n\ne.2. Trace the audit trail involving the transaction.\n\ne.3. Perform a 100% verification of such account.\n\ne.4. Consider performing third party checks to substantiate transactions.\n\ne.5. Take a close look at how the taxpayer handled the entire transaction.\n\ne.6. Consider the adjustments associated to other accounts.\n\ne.7. Discuss the problems or discrepancies with the taxpayer or his authorized representative.\n\nf. Concluding the Sampling Results\n\nThe audit samples should be clearly documented in the working papers from which a conclusion shall be drawn. If a quality sample analysis has been performed, it will be easy to form a conclusion from the sample results. The conclusion reached should be clear, concise and final.\n\nIX. Balance Sheet Approach To Examination\n\nA series of suggestions on the procedures of commencing the examination of tax returns and appropriate accounting records have already been presented. The initial phase includes a verification of the net income per books with the reconciling items reflected in the tax return.\n\nAfter the foregoing process, the revenue officer should turn his attention primarily to the books and records bearing in mind that there are some reconciling items which affect the net income per books.\n\nThe following offer guides to the techniques in examining asset, liability and net worth accounts. The revenue officer, however, is not precluded from applying other techniques which are required in each particular case.\n\nA. Cash on Hand and in Bank\n\na. Compare deposits shown by the bank statement against entries in the cash receipts book and official receipts. Note down any unrecorded or unreceipted deposit and investigate the source.\n\nb. Test check cash sales with the cash receipts book if they have been correctly recorded. Also check cash sales made at the beginning and end of the period under examination to determine if year-end sales have been recorded in the proper accounting period.\n\nc. Investigate entries in the general ledger cash account. Look for unusual items which do not originate from cash receipts or disbursements journals . These entries may indicate unauthorized withdrawals or expenditures, sales of capital assets, omitted sales, undisclosed bank accounts, etc.\n\nd. Review cash receipts journal for items not identified with ordinary business sales, being alert to such items as sales of assets, miscellaneous income, sale of scrap, income received in advance, proceeds from issuance of capital stock and other taxable transactions.\n\ne. Review cash on hand and cash in bank accounts to determine if there are any credit balances during the period under examination. This may indicate unrecorded receipts.\n\nf. Review cash disbursements journal for a representative period. Note any missing check numbers, checks payable to cash, large or unusual items and determine propriety thereof through a comparison with vouchers, journal entries and other related accounting records.\n\ng. If the taxpayer is on cash basis, ascertain if checks were written and recorded at the close of the period under audit but were issued thereafter.\n\nVerify checks issued during the latter part of the year to check the authenticity of expenses claimed.\n\nh. Give special consideration to checks issued for cashier's checks, sight drafts and other similar bank instruments where the payees and nature of the disbursements are clearly shown.\n\ni. Obtain bank statements and cancelled checks for each bank account for one or more months, including the last month of the period under examination.\n\nj. Note year-end bank overdrafts. This may indicate expenses which are fictitious or unallowable since funds were not available for payment.\n\nk. Determine if there are checks which have remained outstanding for an unreasonable period of time. This may indicate improper, fictitious or duplication of disbursements . Old outstanding checks could possibly be restored to income. AHSaTI\n\nl. Determine whether voided checks have been properly adjusted in the books and credited to the appropriate expense accounts, if applicable.\n\nm. For a test period, check endorsements to verify if they are the same as that of the payees', noting any endorsements by the owner, or any questionable endorsement.\n\nn. If records appear unreliable or have not been subjected to a competent independent audit, tests of footings and postings should be made for a representative period.\n\no. Test check disbursements from petty cash to determine if there are any unallowable items included.\n\np. Scrutinize cash overages and shortages, being alert to irregularities.\n\nq. Tally debits and credits to the cash accounts per month against sales credits, and other sources of cash based on the worksheet of real and nominal accounts submitted by the taxpayer. Note down discrepancies and substantial accumulation of cash without reasonable credits.\n\nB. Notes And Accounts Receivable\n\na. Secure a breakdown of the receivables by class, whether notes or accounts and by debtors, such as customers, affiliated companies, officers, stockholders, employees and others.\n\nb. Check entries in the general ledger control accounts Look for unusual items, especially those which do not originate from the sales or cash receipts journals.\n\nc. Determine if subsidiary ledgers are in agreement with control accounts, and if not, ascertain the reasons for any differences.\n\nd. Note any credit balances in the general ledger or subsidiary accounts. This may indicate deposits or overpayments which could be considered as additional income or unrecorded sales. Also, credit balances may indicate a bad debt recovery misapplied or deposits received for so long a time that there is little likelihood that they will ever be refunded. Whatever the cause, the credits, if material, should be isolated for consideration.\n\ne. Some credit sales invoices and postings should be test checked from the sales journal to the subsidiary and control account.\n\nf. Compare balances of accounts receivable and sales with preceding year's. Investigate significant changes.\n\ng. Investigate large and/or unusual balances classified as other accounts receivable.\n\nh. In case of notes receivable, determine whether accrued income on interest bearing notes or accounts has been included in income.\n\ni. Investigate the sources of notes receivable as there may be instances when the taxpayer has other sources of income other than his regular business.\n\nj. Determine whether accrued income on interest bearing notes or accounts has been included in income.\n\nk. If needed, check the detailed listing of beginning receivables to cash collected as reflected in the cash receipts book. This may disclose diversion of funds and other irregularities.\n\nC. Allowance For Bad Debts\n\na. Ascertain the company policy of providing for allowance for bad debts by examining minutes of meeting and other documents.\n\nb. Compare balances in the allowance account with the preceding year's. Investigate significant changes.\n\nc. Evaluate the reasonableness of the allowance by computing the ratio of the balance of allowance for bad debts to the trade accounts receivable balance.\n\nd. Compute the ratio of bad debts expense over sales. Analyze if such is reasonable.\n\ne. Review the aging schedule of accounts receivable.\n\nf. For accounts written off which were charged to expense, examine minute book for authorization to write off accounts.\n\ng. Ascertain that accounts written off are worthless by examining supporting documents such as reports of collection agencies, correspondence with said customers and documents ISAaTH\n\ng. Ascertain that accounts written off are worthless by examining supporting documents such as reports of collection agencies, correspondence with said customers and documents filed in court and court decisions on collection cases.\n\nh. If possible, check the financial status of the customers for which allowance for bad debts were provided.\n\ni. Check entries to the allowance account for possible bad debt recoveries and trace if the same were declared as income at the time of recovery.\n\nD. Inventories\n\na. Determine what cost to include in the inventory. The cost used in determining inventory depend on whether the business is of a service, merchandising or manufacturing nature.\n\nb. Verify the inventory valuation method being applied if such is acceptable for tax purposes and consistently applied from year to year.\n\nc. Compare inventory balances in the return under examination with the balances for the prior and subsequent year's returns and financial statements and verify these with the taxpayer's records.\n\nd. Check authorization for changes in inventory valuation method.\n\ne. Check gross profit percentage variations.\n\nf. Determine the significance of any notes or qualifying statements on financial reports prepared by independent accounting firms.\n\ng. Determine the taxpayer's computation of standard rates if standard rates are applied.\n\nh. Verify cost of production reports and test check certain costs reflected therein to supporting documents.\n\ni. Determine if year-end purchases were included in the closing inventory.\n\nj. Analyze unusual entries to cost of sales account for materials, labor and overhead charges not directly related to sales or transfers of finished goods, if applicable.\n\nk. Determine if there have been write-downs for \"excess\" inventory to below cost. Verify authorization and supporting document/report for such write down.\n\nl. When items have been removed from inventory for the owner's or shareholders' use, check of this is properly recorded as part of sales.\n\nE. Advances To Stockholders/Officers\n\nThis receivable account may represent an outright advance of money by the corporation to officers and/or stockholders. Usually, these advances vary in amounts over a period of time, building up to the current amount. The following verification procedures on this account should be conducted, if warranted:\n\na. Verify authorization from Board of Directors for advances and loans to stockholders and officers by checking duly approved minutes of meetings.\n\nb. Identify company officers and stockholders who are granted advances regularly.\n\nc. Check payments of advances to the company if such earned interest for which no withholding tax was deducted.\n\nd. Verify entries on cancellation of advances if the same do not originate from cash receipts.\n\nF. Investment\n\nThe investments most commonly found on the books are stocks and bonds and, in some cases, real estate not used in actual business operations. The following procedures should be conducted in the examination of investments, if such are material assets of the taxpayer:\n\na. Become familiar with the nature of investments, utilizing any records maintained by the taxpayers such as the investment ledgers, worksheets showing the breakdown of investments and other investment records.\n\nb. Analyze sales and other credit entries. If stocks sold are listed in the stock market, test check selling price of stocks sold at the prevailing \"close\" price at the Philippine Stock Exchange during the date of sale. Real properties sold should not fall below fair market value and/or zonal value where the zonal value has been established, whichever is higher.\n\nc. Verify journal entries to ascertain the selling price and gain on sale of investments. Vouch supporting documents such as deeds of sale, proof of remittance of taxes withheld, payment of documentary stamp tax and other relevant records.\n\nd. Investigate sales to related parties and/or to officers or stockholders below fair market value.\n\ne. All investments during the year should be cross-checked to the interest, dividend or rental income accounts.\n\nf. If investments or bonds were acquired at a premium or discount, determine whether the premium/discount is amortized.\n\nG. Depreciable Assets\n\nThis group includes tangible properties of relatively long life which are used in the operation of the business. Natural resources such as oil or mineral lands are not included in this group. The following verification procedures should be undertaken on these accounts:\n\na. Compare the asset and related reserve amounts as they appear on the tax return, balance sheet, depreciation schedule and taxpayer's books and schedules. Compare the beginning and ending figures for the taxable year and reconcile differences or ask the taxpayer to make a reconciliation. Verify such reconciliation.\n\nb. Review depreciation schedule of fixed assets and ascertain propriety of depreciation expense claimed. Watch out for depreciation that may have been taken on assets which are fully depreciated or charged off to expense.\n\nc. Review asset additions during the year by reference to invoices, contracts and other documents and determine if the proper basis was used.\n\nc.1. Note items which appear to have originated from unusual sources such as appraisal increases, transfers and exchanges, and determine propriety thereof. Ascertain if prior earnings were adequate to cover acquisitions.\n\nc.2. Determine if acquisition and installation costs of fixed assets and leasehold improvements have been capitalized.\n\nc.3. Ascertain if assets include items of a personal nature. If the assets are used by the officers for their personal use, the depreciation should be disallowed.\n\nc.4. Where construction or another work of a capital nature is performed with the taxpayer's own labor, equipment and other assets for its own use, be certain that the basis of such asset includes materials, labor and overhead including depreciation.\n\nc.5. With regard to the basis of assets, consider such items as trade-ins, acquisitions from related taxpayers, allocation of cost between land and building and other basis.\n\nd. Decreases in the asset accounts during the year should be noted. Gains or losses resulting therefrom should be verified and ascertain that the appropriate tax, such as value-added tax, if applicable, has been paid.\n\ne. Ascertain if the taxpayer has transferred assets to the owner, officers, stockholders or to a controlled domestic or foreign corporation for less than fair consideration.\n\nH. Allowances For Depreciation, Amortization And Other Valuation Reserves\n\na. Review the nature and source of all accounts and ascertain if they are being used to claim unallowable deductions.\n\nb. With regard to depreciation, determine the correctness of the amount being depreciated. No depreciation is allowable on the appraisal increase of fixed assets. Any foreseeable salvage is to be deducted from the cost of the asset in determining the basis of depreciation.\n\nb.1. No depreciation is allowable on a building until it is completed or on a machine until it is installed. Expenditures which are properly includible as an element of cost are freight-in, installation cost, title cost, and legal or brokerage fees in connection with acquisition.\n\nb.2. Where land and building are acquired on lump-sum, the following formula should be used in computing the building cost for depreciation computation:\n\nc. Consider the depreciation and amortization policies:\n\nc.1. Whether the methods applied by the taxpayer are in compliance with the Tax Code and existing revenue regulations; CSHEAI\n\nc.2. Whether the depreciation rates used by the taxpayer are fair and reasonable;\n\nc.3. Whether the taxpayer has applied the same method consistently from period to period; and\n\nd. Check authorization from minutes of meetings, fixed asset reports, etc. on credits for allowance for obsolescence and/or asset write-offs. If necessary, inspect assets claimed as obsolete and/or written off.\n\nI. Intangible Assets\n\na. Investigate the nature of the intangible whether leases, patents, licenses, trademarks, goodwill, copyright, franchise and others.\n\nb. Costs of acquiring the intangible should be capitalized when useful lives can be estimated. If not, no amortization is allowable for tax purposes.\n\nc. Determine if the cost and cost of current additions includes proper elements such as legal fees, application fees and other costs of acquisition. Examine contracts and other legal documents.\n\nd. Verify correctness of deductions claimed as follows:\n\nd.1. Leasehold costs are subject to amortization over the term of the lease.\n\nd.2. Goodwill cannot be amortized if it is for an indefinite period of time.\n\nd.3. Research and development expenditures may be capitalized or treated as deductible expense.\n\nd.4. Patents sold with the exclusive right to make, use and sell an article constitutes ordinary income.\n\nd.5. Organization expenses are not deductible in the year incurred. Check the reasonableness of the taxpayer's amortization policy on original expense.\n\ne. Determine if there have been transactions with related taxpayers. If so, consider arms length features.\n\nf. Determine if income applicable to intangibles has been included as income, e.g. subleases, over-riding royalties, franchises and other sources.\n\ng. Analyze any transaction involving transfer of foreign rights to any foreign entity for an equity interest or for nominal consideration.\n\nh. Be alert to transactions which could have given rise to intangibles which may have been recorded as expense.\n\nJ. Prepaid Expenses And Deferred Charges\n\na. Verify the nature and source of these assets and the manner in which they are charged off to expense.\n\nb. When prepaid expenses are not present in the balance sheet, verify charges to expenses which entail advance payments such as insurance, rent, supplies, repairs and maintenance as covered by contracts.\n\nK. Other Assets\n\na. When material in amount, obtain a schedule of other assets\n\nb. Investigate sources of charges to the account; verify entries and supporting documents to check if the other assets are results of income generating activities not reported in the financial statements.\n\nL. Exchange, Clearing or Suspense Account\n\na. If significant in amount, obtain a schedule to determine the nature and purpose of the account.\n\nb. Test check debit-and credit entries, being aware of the possibility that such account may be used as a means for diverting sales, padding expenses and other irregularities.\n\nM. Current And Accrued Liabilities Including Notes Payable\n\nThese liabilities are found on business records under various titles, such as accounts payable, vouchers payable, notes payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities. The procedures are as follows:\n\na. Reconcile subsidiary ledgers with the control accounts. Request the taxpayer for explanation for any discrepancies. SDEHCc\n\nb. Note debit balances in the general ledger or subsidiary accounts. This may indicate diversion of funds and other underdeclaration of income.\n\nc. Note accounts which have long overdue balances. This may indicate contested liabilities or accounts which no longer exist such as unclaimed wages or unclaimed deposits which should be reverted to income.\n\nd. Review computation of year-end accruals with respect to their deductibility as expenses or purchases.\n\ne. Examine legitimacy of accounts payable to affiliates or related taxpayers. Test check payments made.\n\nf. Investigate entries in the general ledger control accounts. Check unusual items such as those that do not originate from the voucher register or disbursement book. This may disclose unreported income, improper or overstated expense.\n\ng. Be aware of any contingent liability by reading minutes or annual reports. Although this is not reflected in the return, an accrual may have been made for the item. To be deductible, an expense cannot be contingent. It must be reasonably determinable in amount and the liability must be fixed.\n\nh. If payables include security deposits, read the lease term to determine application of the deposits. They are taxable when received.\n\nN. Fixed Liabilities\n\na. Acquaint with the pertinent provisions of loan contracts, mortgage agreements, certificates of indebtedness, financing arrangements and consider possible adjustment areas as follows:\n\na.1. determination of expenses, e.g. interest and bank charges\n\na.2. refunding of debt\n\na.3. legal, professional and other expenses of issuance\n\nb. Scrutinize any long-term outstanding liability to the owner, shareholders, officers or to a related taxpayer as this may be accumulated unreported income.\n\nc. When the liability is secured by pledged collateral or mortgage, ascertain that income has been reported from such collateral.\n\nd. Verify if funds were borrowed for use of affiliates as the interest expense thereon shall not be deductible on the part of the borrowing taxpayer. This must be shifted to the affiliate.\n\ne. Determine if loans were borrowed to finance tax exempt securities. If so, the interest expense is not deductible.\n\nO. Deferred Credits\n\na. Check all payments received in the cash receipts book., i.e. date of receipt and other entries.\n\nb. Check if payments received were included in the gross income for the year payments were received. Amounts are generally includible in gross income for tax purposes not later than the time of receipt if they are subject to free and unrestricted used by the taxpayer. (Advance rents, legal retainer and the like, advance sales of transportation tokens or communications tickets and other advances are income when received under this theory).\n\nc. Look for credit balance accounts which fall in these categories. They may be clearly labeled as advance rents, deferred service income or may be shown as a reserve mixed with true liability accounts, or as a contra-balance in receivables.\n\nd. If the taxpayer used the completed contract method of accounting, income and expenses attributable to a particular job or project are properly deferred until substantial completion. The contracts and progress reports should be inspected to determine whether income has been delayed beyond the completion of the project.\n\ne. When a taxpayer uses the installment method of reporting income, the unrecognized gain for tax purposes should be recorded as a deferred credit. This particular account should be checked to determine if the year-end balance remaining in the account reconciles with the gross profit to be reported on the subsequent payments. A difference would indicate that the current or prior installment computations of the taxpayer were erroneous. ISTECA\n\nP. Loans from Shareholders/Officers/Owners\n\na. Determine whether there is a true debtor-creditor relationship. Excessively large liabilities in relation to capital stock (especially in the case of a new company) may indicate a thin capitalization situation.\n\nb. Check the financial statements of the corporation as well as that of the shareholders. If there is an interest expense account on the part of the corporation from such loan, there should also be an interest income account on the part of the shareholder.\n\nThere are certain advantages to the corporation or shareholder for an equity investment to be treated as a loan. See that the taxpayer gets these benefits only when the facts of the case show that a true loan exists.\n\nIf \"loans\" are found to be equity capital, then:\n\nb.1. Disallow interest expense; treat as dividends.\n\nb.2. Treat repayments as dividends.\n\nb.3. Disallow bad debts deductions by the shareholders.\n\nc. Check supporting loan documents issued in favor of the shareholders, officers or owners. If unsupported or if support is doubtful, the unreported income may be lodged in this account.\n\nd. Test check payments of loans against check vouchers and paid checks.\n\ne. Verify the debit and credit entries in the general ledger account and watch out for unusual sources other than the cash receipts and disbursements book.\n\nf. Examine adjustments, specially increases in the account, at the end of the year as this may constitute shifting of taxable income to this liability account. Verify general journal entries, journal vouchers and related documents supporting the entries.\n\nQ. Capital Accounts\n\na. Capital or Owner's Equity \u2014 for sole proprietorship\n\na.1. Review debits and credits to the account during the period under audit and check supporting entries to the account. Increases which originate from sources other than profit and loss may indicate omitted income.\n\na.2 Reconcile amount appearing on the books, return and financial statements. Verify discrepancies, if any.\n\na.3. Relate the account balance and withdrawals with the owner's standard of living. Where owners report no other sources of income and withdrawals appear insufficient to maintain personal living expenses there may be underreporting or diversion of income.\n\nb. Partners' Capital \u2014 for partnerships\n\nb.1. Review debits and credits to the account during the period under audit. Verify increases and decreases and check for unusual sources other than profit and loss.\n\nb.2. Reconcile amount appearing on the tax return, books and financial statements. Verify any differences noted.\n\nb.3. Examine pertinent provisions of partnership contract and check correctness of distribution of partnership income and expenses.\n\nb.4. Ascertain that the correct tax has been withheld on distribution of partnership profits.\n\nb.5. If the taxpayer claims that it is a general professional partnership, examine partnership contract and registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nc. Stockholders ' Equity \u2014 for corporations\n\nc.1. Capital Stock\n\nc.1.1. Review entries in the capital stock account and verify increases and decreases.\n\nc.1.2. Verify correctness of all items appearing on the return, books and financial statements. Investigate discrepancies, if any.\n\nc.1.3. In case of additions to capital stock out of new issues during the period under audit, ascertain that the correct amount of documentary stamp tax has been paid. Secure a photocopy of the proof of payment.\n\nc.1.4. Compare data from minute book with items recorded on the books of accounts to determine if entries have been made.\n\nc.1.5. Determine if expenses relating to stock issuance have been properly handled (legal fees, registration fees, broker's commission and other expenses).\n\nc.1.6. Determine during the examination of a recapitalization of the stock in a closely held company if the fair market value of the stock to be received by each exchanging shareholder is equal to the fair market value of the stock surrendered in the exchange. If there is a significant difference, the revenue officer should consider the possibility of considering the difference as a donation, and therefore subject to donor's tax.\n\nc.1.7. If a reorganization has taken place, examine the following documents:\n\nc.1.7.1 The reorganization plan AcTHCE\n\nc.1.7.2 Journal entries giving effect to the reorganization\n\nc.1.7.3. Notes of all minute book references to it\n\nc.1.7.4. Notes of pertinent information from the correspondence file with other parties to the reorganization\n\nc.1.8. Examine by-laws, articles of incorporation or other documents in stocks; and support of other transactions affecting capital stock.\n\nc.1.9. Determine if the increase in capital stock is the direct consequence of an exchange of property under Section 34(c)(2) of the Tax Code. If so, confirm compliance with the conditions set for the non-recognition of gain or loss by performing the following audit procedures:\n\nc.1.9.1. In case of merger or consolidation\n\nc.1.9.1.1. Verify if the plan of reorganization has been adopted by each of the parties to the reorganization.\n\nc.1.9.1.2. Check if the income tax return filed for the taxable year in which the exchange took place incorporated all the facts pertinent to the non-recognition of gain or loss upon such exchange, such as:\n\nc.1.9.1.2.1. the historical cost or other basis of valuation of all properties, including all stocks or securities, transferred incident to the plan; and\n\nc.1.9.1.2.2. the nature and amount of liability assumed upon the exchange and the amount and nature of any liabilities to which any of the property acquired in the exchange is subject.\n\nc.1.9.1.3. Verify Deed of Assignment of property for shares of stocks; and\n\nc.1.9.1.4. Check if Documentary Stamp tax has been paid.\n\nc.1.9.2 In case of transfer of property to a controlled corporation\n\nc.1.9.2.1 Verify if the transferor and the transferee filed an income tax return for the taxable year in which the exchange was consummated with a complete statement of all facts pertinent to the exchange;\n\nc.1.9.2.2. Verify Deed of Assignment;\n\nc.1.9.2.3. Determine if transferor of property acquired at least 51% of the total voting stock, alone or together with others, not exceeding four persons of the transferee-corporation; and\n\nc.1.9.2.4. Determine if the Documentary stamp tax was paid.\n\nc.1.9.3. In both cases, ascertain if the following information has been annotated at the back of the Transfer Certificates of Title or certificates of stock:\n\nc.1.9.3.1. Date the deed of exchange was executed;\n\nc.1.9.3.2. The original or historical cost of property; and\n\nc.1.9.3.3. The fact that no gain or less was recognized as a result of such exchange.\n\nc.2. Retained Earnings\n\nThe investigation of the retained earnings (or deficit, in case of accumulated losses), is a very important part of the audit process as this is related to the net worth method of investigation. It is the account to which the net income or net loss from operations is transferred and accumulated. The minimum audit procedures that should be undertaken in analyzing this account are as follows:\n\nc.2.1. Compare the amount shown on the return, financial statements, books of accounts and the schedule of reconciliation of net income per books and per return. Verify differences, if any.\n\nc.2.2. Verify correctness of all items, both increases and decreases appearing on the books or return. Trace opening retained earnings balance to the balance sheet of the prior period.\n\nc.2.3. Check increases which do not originate from net income. Verify entries from the general journal/journal vouchers, specially those recorded other than as year-end adjustments as these may indicate sales or income directly posted to the retained earnings account.\n\nc.2.4. Determine if declared and unpaid dividends are properly recorded. Compare paid dividends to Directors' minutes.\n\nc.2.5. For taxpayers incurring continuous losses and deficit balance, investigate the real status of the business. Tour company premises, evaluate the volume of business and compare the information gathered with the financial data reported. There may be underreporting of sales as there is very little reason for a business to exist if it is continuously incurring losses.\n\nc.2.6. Examine supporting documents and authorization for all other transactions in retained earnings to determine conformity with existing tax laws.\n\nX. Audit Of Income And Expenses\n\nThis Chapter discusses the books of accounts, accounting records and documents used to record income and expense transactions. It enumerates the audit procedures and techniques for income and expenses.\n\nThe audit of income or revenues are applicable to resident and non-resident individuals engaged in business and the practice of profession, estates and trusts engaged in trade or business, general professional and business partnerships and corporations.\n\nExpenses chargeable against income are allowable in their entirety only for business partnerships and corporations. Self-employed resident citizens and aliens engaged in business or the practice of profession, non-resident aliens engaged in business, estates and trusts engaged in trade or business and general professional partnerships as defined under Section 20 (b) of the Tax Code, as amended, and their individual partners can claim expenses subject to certain limitations under Republic Act. No. 7496 adopting the Simplified Net Income Taxation Scheme (SNITS), as implemented by Revenue Regulations No. 2-93. SCHcaT\n\nUnder the SNITS, a taxpayer can claim itemized deductions as follows:\n\na. Raw materials, supplies and direct labor;\n\nb. Salaries of employees directly performing services for the taxpayer in the course of or pursuant to his business or practice of his profession;\n\nc. Telecommunication, electricity, fuel, light and water;\n\nd. Business rental;\n\ne. Depreciation;\n\nf. Contribution made to the Government and accredited relief organizations for the rehabilitation of calamity-stricken areas declared by the President; and\n\ng. Interest paid or accrued within a taxable year on loans contracted from accredited financial institutions which must be proven to have been paid or incurred in connection with the conduct of a taxpayer's profession, trade or business.\n\nHowever, Sec. 29, NIRC, as amended by R.A. No. 7496, provides a maximum of forty percent allowable deduction based on gross sales, in the case of seller of goods, or gross revenue in the case of seller of services when the cost of goods sold and deductions are difficult to determine. Such 40% allowable deduction shall answer for business or professional expenses. A taxpayer who elected to claim the itemized deduction under SNITS, but who upon subsequent audit by the BIR cannot substantiate any or all of the expenses with the proper receipts shall not be allowed to revert to and claim the 40% maximum deduction.\n\nThe subsequent discussions on the procedures and techniques in the investigation of income and expense accounts are general audit guides. The revenue officer should not be hindered in applying additional procedures and techniques which he deems necessary based on his initial findings, evaluation of internal control, reliability of accounting records and analytical review of operations.\n\na. Sales\n\na.1. Review the taxpayer's accounting method of revenue recognition if acceptable and consistent with prior years.\n\na.2. Ascertain that all sales were reported as of the cut-off date. Cut-off refers to the point at which entries from one accounting period stop and entries for the next period begins. This is typically the last day of a taxable year. If the last day of the taxable year is not used, the taxpayer must substantiate his choice.\n\na.3. Verify revenues/sales recorded and deposited near the end of the tax year and immediately during the subsequent month to determine if these pertain to income earned for the tax year under examination.\n\na.4. Account for all sales invoices issued. Match delivery receipts, gate passes, if any, against sales invoices issued.\n\na.5. Compare totals of sales invoices, sales summary, entries in subsidiary sales and sales journals and general ledger accounts. Inquire and investigate discrepancies between book entries and returns filed.\n\na.6. Reconcile credits to sales with debits to accounts receivable and debits to cash receipts book. Test check monthly entries.\n\na.7. Research unusual and unfamiliar issuances of goods or goods which are not normally sold by the taxpayer.\n\na.8. Conduct interviews to secure information regarding the taxpayer's business, financial history, number of employees and other information which may lead to sales estimation.\n\na.9. Determine inventory method applied if acceptable and consistently followed.\n\na.10. Determine if merchandise is being withdrawn for personal use or for any other purpose not in relation to normal sales process.\n\na.11. Scan credit memo issued to customers and test check entries to Sales Returns & Allowances and Sales Discounts to insure proper recording of credits.\n\na.12. Verify cancelled sales invoices by test checking deposits made and withdrawal of goods on the day of cancellation.\n\na.13. Tour the business premises to obtain information on:\n\na.13.1. Sales volume\n\na.13.2. Volume of sales return and method of handling sales returns\n\na.13.3. Major products\n\na.13.4. Other by-products and scrap sales, if any\n\na.13.5. Equipments used in operation\n\na.13.6. Nature, quality and size of facilities\n\na.13.7. Inventory level\n\nIn touring the premises, be observant and ask questions.\n\na.14. Review sales contracts, consignment agreements and other documents relative to sales. CcADHI\n\na.15. On installment sales, ascertain that collections have been properly segregated as to the year of sales and that the proper gross profit ratios have been applied. Review unearned or deferred income accounts for any uncollected balances which have been outstanding for an unreasonable period of time.\n\na.16. Determine whether sales on consigned goods are taken up at the time of shipment or after 60 days from date goods were consigned.\n\na.17. Where the internal control is weak and records are unreliable or inadequate, apply other approaches to audit revenue such as cash analysis, net-worth analysis, third party verification and other indirect approaches.\n\nb. Rent Income\n\nb.1. Obtain copies and review lease contracts.\n\nb.2. Tour the premises under lease. Identify tenants and monthly or annual rentals. Conduct interviews if necessary.\n\nb.3. Relate real properties under lease agreement to assets declared in the balance sheet. Note inconsistencies between asset values and income generated.\n\nb.4. Where the rental income is based on a percentage of sales of the lessee, the sales of the lessee should be tested for a representative period, say one month, to get a proper approximation of the lessee's sales during the taxable year under audit and the rental income received by the lessor. In such cases, proper authorization from the lessee should be obtained before conducting the test verification.\n\nb.5. Research on rental of neighboring properties and compare with rent income reported.\n\nb.6. Scrutinize official receipts. Compare total with general ledger balance, tax return declaration and financial statements. Account for discrepancies.\n\nb.7. Ascertain acceptability and consistency of accounting methods. For cash-basis taxpayers, prepaid rent and rental deposits constitute income during the year of receipt.\n\nb.8. The revenue officer should be alert on lease contracts which are actually conditional sales.\n\nb.9. Where necessary, obtain copies of Transfer Certificates of Title, tax declarations, mayor's or municipal permits and real property tax receipts to determine properties which may be hidden by the taxpayer.\n\nc. Professional Fees\n\nc.1. Determine the taxpayer's accounting methods of recognizing income, whether cash or accrual. Most professionals, however, adopt the cash basis of accounting.\n\nc.2. Examine contracts with clients and other correspondence/documents in relation to professional services rendered.\n\nc.3. Check copies of BIR forms on taxes withheld on professional fees. Tally with the income declared per return.\n\nc.4. Compare income reported on the tax return with the books of accounts, creditable withholding tax forms, financial statements and official receipts issued. Verify discrepancies, if any.\n\nc.5. Account for official receipts issued. Note any missing receipt or break in the series.\n\nc.6. Analyze the reasonableness of expenses claimed in relation to income declared.\n\nc.7. Conduct interviews and third party verification, if necessary.\n\nc.8. Relate the income reported per tax return to the lifestyle and assets owned by the taxpayer. If the assets of the taxpayer and estimated cost of living expenses are beyond the income earned, verify and compute for possible underdeclaration of income.\n\nd. Income from Sale of Asset\n\nd.1. Identify in the tax returns and financial statements any sale, exchange or disposal of assets other than inventories.\n\nd.2. Obtain copies of deeds of sale and other documents relating to the sale.\n\nd.3. Determine zonal values, fair market values or appraisal values and compare with the selling price.\n\nd.4. Compute any underdeclaration of sales by comparing the selling price with the existing fair market value, zonal value or value of similar properties sold.\n\nd.5. In case of disposal of capital assets, ascertain compliance with the provisions of the Tax Code on capital gains and losses.\n\nd.6. Verify sales of property reported on the installment basis and determine if all requirements pertaining thereto have been complied with.\n\nd.7. Determine if proper accounting for depreciation, book value and salvage value was taken up.\n\nd.8. Inquire from certain company personnel on possible sales of assets which may not have been recorded. DECcAS\n\ne. Other Income\n\ne.1. Scrutinize the general ledger and general journal for any other income or other receivables recorded.\n\ne.2. Test check entries in intercompany accounts for shifting income or management fees that may have been charged to affiliates.\n\ne.3. Investigate suspense accounts and unusual liability accounts, such as due to affiliates/due to stockholders and other payables to uncover possible income not recorded in the income accounts.\n\nB. Audit Of Expense Accounts\n\na. Purchases\n\nFor taxpayers engaged in trading and manufacturing, purchases is one of the largest accounts in the income statement. Thus, there is a possibility that taxpayers may hide a number of non-deductible expenditures in this account due to the volume of transactions posted to it. The following principal audit procedures should be followed in examining purchases:\n\na.1. Account for all purchase invoices and receiving reports as of the cut-off date. Determine if year-end purchases have been recorded in the proper accounting period.\n\na.2. Compare totals of purchases in the return, income statement, purchase book, subsidiary purchases book, if any, and general ledger. Determine any discrepancy and investigate its nature as well as the nature of year-end adjustments.\n\na.3. Determine that the purchases declared are neither overstated nor understated by vouching the supporting documents, test-checking footings of invoices, purchase books and ledger accounts. Understatement of purchases may also mean underdeclared sales.\n\na.4. Tour the premises where inventory items are kept and correlate actual inventory level against purchases reported.\n\na.5. Scan the purchase book and look for items unusual in amount and payee. Take note of suppliers not generally associated with the products or services handled by the taxpayer.\n\na.6. Verify entries in the general ledger account which originate from unusual sources such as journal entries, debit and credit memoranda and other accounting records.\n\na.7. Test check recorded purchases for a representative period with suppliers' invoices and cancelled checks. Note if these are personal expenditures, withdrawals of merchandise by the owners, fictitious or duplicate invoices, cancelled purchase invoices, excessive rebates discounts and allowances and purchases not received.\n\na.8. Where there are only a few major suppliers, conduct third party verification to ascertain the correctness of purchases declared if there is suspicion of fraud.\n\na.9. If purchases are from suppliers related to the owners or from affiliates, conduct a review of a number of transactions to uncover prices in excess of market value, excessive rebates and allowances and other similar schemes.\n\nb. Cost Of Goods Sold\n\nb.1. Verify the inventory valuation method applied by the taxpayer whether first-in, first-out, last-in, first-out, specific identification, weighted average or simple average. Last-in, first-out is not acceptable for income tax purposes. Determine consistency of application of method from year to year.\n\nb.2. Obtain an understanding of the production process by familiarization with the taxpayer's business, tour of the premises, conducting interviews and analyzing cost of production report.\n\nb.3. Compare inventory balances in the return under examination with the balances for the prior and subsequent years' returns, and verify these with the general ledger and the physical inventory summary.\n\nb.4. Check unauthorized changes in inventory valuation method from period to period. Take samples from the summary inventory sheets and determine if the taxpayer has not improperly valued any item.\n\nb.5. Check gross profit variations. Any significant variation should be discussed with the taxpayer and a reasonable explanation obtained. A material decrease in gross profit from one year to the next could be due to understated ending inventory.\n\nb.6. Determine the significance of notes or qualifying statements on financial reports prepared by external auditors. Any unusual comments or qualifying statements about the inventories or cost of sales that have a material tax effect should be discussed with the taxpayer and, if necessary, with a representative of the external auditor.\n\nb.7. If the taxpayer applies standard or predetermined cost in costing goods manufactured, the revenue officer should inspect the working papers and production report used to calculate the cost per unit and insure that expenses included are allowable.\n\nb.8. Analyze unusual entries to cost of sales; account for labor, materials and overhead charges not directly related to sales or transfers of finished goods The taxpayer may be trying to include in the cost of sales a non-deductible item.\n\nb.9. Determine that year-end purchases are included in closing inventory. Review purchase invoices at the last month of the taxable year under audit and compare quantities on the inventory summary for classes of goods purchased with the quantity in the ending inventory list and quantity of sales recorded at year's end for such goods. Thus, if a specific item or a certain quantity of goods were purchased on the last day of the year, it should be included in the ending inventory unless sold that same day.\n\nb.10. Determine reductions in ending inventory values by reviewing authorization for write-downs and provision for obsolescence or decline in market values. Check minutes of meetings for such authorization, analyze journal entries for the write-down or provision of allowance for obsolescence/decline in value, check itemized inventory summary sheet and test-check the list with actual inventory observation. SaCIAE\n\nc. Salaries, Wages and Other Employees' Benefits\n\nc.1. Evaluate the expense initially by comparing the ratio of salaries and wages to sales and the percentage of taxes withheld to total salaries, allowances, bonus and other compensations. Low ratios might indicate that the company hires sub-contractors or an understatement of the expenses which may be a lead underdeclared-sales. High ratios may mean also an understatement of sales or padded payroll with fictitious or terminated employees.\n\nc.2. Review payroll sheets. All expenses claimed having the semblance of a compensation payment should be verified together.\n\nc.3.

The following guidelines should be followed in the verification of the deduction for depletion:\n\nl.3.1. Determine that any aggregation of mineral interest are proper;\n\nl.3.2. Ascertain that the sales reported in regard to each property do not include sales applicable to another property, sales of purchased minerals, non-minerals sales or other income items.\n\nl.3.3. Ascertain, where applicable, if mineral sales have been adjusted to \"gross income from the property\" by reduction of such factors as unallowable treatment cost, unallowable transportation costs, rents and royalties including a proportionate part of lease bonuses, amounts paid to others in contract mining or similar operations where the other party has acquired an economic interest and is entitled to depletion, certain excise taxes, trade discounts allowed and other deductions.\n\nl.3.4.

Ascertain if the miscellaneous expenses claimed do not contain any personal items.\n\nXI. Auditing Computer - Produced Records\n\nA. Impact of Computer Records on Audit\n\nThe use of computers to process accounting data has a significant effect on the audit skills of the revenue officer. The ability to understand and evaluate the automated data processing (ADP) system is important. The revenue officer must understand the flow of accounting data or audit trails on an ADP system to conduct a quality audit.\n\nB. Accounting Software Systems\n\nAuditing computer records require basic techniques used in auditing manual books and records. There is still a need to:\n\na. Perform an effective pre-audit;\n\nb. Interview the taxpayer;\n\nc. Tour the business;\n\nd. Evaluate internal controls;\n\ne. Reconcile the books to the return;\n\nf. Reevaluate your previous pre-audit;\n\ng. Set the scope of the audit;\n\nh. Test the amounts you have identified as questionable;\n\ni. Ask questions about the data you have examined; and\n\nj. Apply accounting principles and tax law to reach the proper conclusion regarding the data examined.\n\nAs part of the initial interview, the revenue officer should ask questions to achieve a clear understanding of the taxpayer's books and records, such as:\n\n\u2014 Find out what type of system software is being utilized. TAECSD\n\n\u2014 Determine who authorizes the debit and credit of certain accounts.\n\n\u2014 Determine who encodes the accounting transactions. If the same person enters both the payables and the receivables, there is no segregation of functions. This would allow one person to perpetuate or conceal errors by controlling the offsetting debits and credits. Internal control should be made for all business returns.\n\n\u2014 Find out how often reports are generated and what reports are generated. The taxpayer may not utilize reports that the software system can generate.\n\n\u2014 In addition to asking the taxpayer about the particular accounting system, the revenue officer may briefly skim the software manual. The manual will tell how the system works and the types of reports available. The revenue officer shall use judgment to determine the time to spend reviewing the software capabilities.\n\nC. Audit Techniques For Computer- Produced Records\n\na. Auditing hardcopy records\n\nThe traditional audit approach to double-entry books and records is to scan through the general ledger noting any unusual entries. The purpose of this scanning is to identify entries which are unusual due to the amount, source or nature of the entry. When an audit trail is not clear, have the taxpayer prepare a schedule substantiating deductions. Have the taxpayer demonstrate the trail through computerized records.\n\nb. Identify unusual entries in the Computerized General Ledger\n\nb.1 Unusual in Amount\n\nThe basic technique for identifying large changes to accounts in a computerized system consists of securing the monthly statements.\n\nUsually, these will be retained by the taxpayer. The monthly balances are reviewed for changes. Changes in the monthly account balances are then explored by reviewing the monthly detail and scanning the check register. The revenue officer considers if the change could be expected, is reasonable and in the expected direction, and is material enough to warrant investigation. For example, if monthly trial balances showed rent expense of P500 and one month showed P1,500, you would ask the taxpayer about the P1,500 rent expense.\n\nb.2. Unusual by Source\n\nThe basic technique for detecting entries to accounts from unusual sources consists of comparing monthly posting summaries from each source with the chart of accounts. A computerized system will utilize monthly posting summaries. These summaries will show monthly changes to an account, most often by account number and originating journal. By comparing the accounts which show monthly changes with the chart of accounts, posting to unusual accounts can be detected. Scan the accounts payable listings for vendors that appear personal.\n\nb.3. Unusual by Nature\n\nThe basic technique for detecting entries to accounts which are unusual by nature involves the same process as shown for detecting entries from unusual sources. You are looking for debit posting to accounts which normally contain only credit posting and vice versa. An example would be a debit to a sales account which could be a bad debt written-off. Accounts which exist at the beginning of the year and not at the end might indicate unauthorized accounting changes.\n\nXII. Indirect Approach\n\nReconstruction of income is generally employed where the taxpayer keeps no record or inadequate records, or where there is strong suspicion that the taxpayer has received income from undisclosed sources.\n\nOver the years, the Bureau of Internal Revenue has developed the following general methods for reconstructing a taxpayer's income:\n\nA. Percentage method\n\nB. Net worth method\n\nC. Bank deposits method\n\nD. Cash expenditure method\n\nE. Unit and value method\n\nF. Third party information or access to records method\n\nG. Surveillance and assessment method\n\nA. Percentage Method\n\nThis method is the equivalent of a ratio analysis of percentages considered typical of the business under investigation to indicate potential areas of revenue adjustment in examination where revenue records do not exist. The computed amount of revenues based on the percentage computation is compared to the amount of revenues reflected on the return. The percentages used may be obtained by an industry publication, prior years' results, the taxpayer or third parties. The comparison will provide an indication on the possibility of revenue being understated. The extent of investigation required should be based on the degree of variance.\n\nIt must, however, be emphasized that in comparing transactions of similarly situated businesses, the name of the particular taxpayer used as the model must not be divulged to the taxpayer under investigation nor in the report as this would constitute a violation by an internal revenue officer of the provisions of Section 269, National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC)on unlawful divulgence of trade secrets.\n\nSignificant ratios and trends to be analyzed are as follows:\n\na. Percentage Mark-up\n\nThis is effective on businesses whose purchases can be readily broken down in groups with approximately the same percentage of mark-up.\n\nThe purchases should be grouped in items with the same percentage of mark-up. The appropriate percentage of mark-up would then be applied to each group of items to arrive at the gross receipts.\n\nThe percentage of mark-up can be determined from selling prices obtained from the taxpayer. However, if cooperation from the taxpayer is lacking, the information should be obtained from competitive business establishments in the same industry.\n\nOnce the gross receipts are determined the taxpayer should be given the opportunity to explain the discrepancy noted between the reconstructed gross receipts and the amounts indicated by the records and the tax returns. The taxpayer may argue that the percentage mark-up should not be applied to purchases which were stolen, broken or spoiled.\n\nWhen reconstructing income using the mark-up method, possible unrecorded purchases should be considered.\n\nb. Gross Profit Ratio or Gross Margin Percentage\n\nThe gross profit is expressed as a percentage of sales.\n\nNOTE: Sales should be net of Sales Discounts, Returns and Allowances\n\nComparisons should be made with prior period ratios to evaluate the taxpayer's own performance in previous years or with other firm's in the same industry.\n\nc. Profit Margin\n\nIf the profit margin is low, this will indicate that the firms' sales prices are relatively low or that its costs are relatively high or both.\n\nd. Total Assets Turnover\n\nA high rate compared to the industry would signify sufficient volume of business and if a net loss is declared, questions must be raised or further investigation and analysis should be performed.\n\nIf the turnover is low, the company could be holding damaged or obsolete materials not actually worth their stated volume.\n\nAverage Inventory at a given point x turnover rate = total purchases during the year AcSEHT\n\nB. Net Worth Method\n\nThe fact that the taxpayer's books and records accurately reflect the figures on the income and business tax returns does not prevent the use of the net worth method of proof. The Revenue Officer can still look beyond the \"self-serving declarations\" in the taxpayer's books and records and use any evidences available to contravene their accuracy. However, this net worth method is most often used when one or more of the following conditions prevail:\n\n1. The taxpayer maintains no books and records.\n\n2. The taxpayer's books and records are not available.\n\n3. The taxpayer's books and records are inadequate.\n\n4. The taxpayer withholds books and records.\n\nThis is a method of reconstructing income which is based on the theory that if the taxpayer's net worth has increased in a given year in an amount larger than his reported income, he had understated his income for that year.\n\nIn applying this method, it is important to establish the net worth on a fixed starting date. This is to erase doubts that the increase in net worth or the excess of expenditures over reported income did not originate from prior accumulated funds (i.e. hoarded cash or undisclosed assets which do not represent income during the tax year).\n\nb. Burden of Proof\n\nThe \"Net Worth\" method to be acceptable must establish with reasonable certainty an opening net worth, to serve as a starting point from which to compute future increases in the taxpayer's assets. It must also introduce evidence to support the inference that the taxpayer's net increases are attributable to currently taxable income.\n\nIn computing the increase, the taxpayer's assets are totaled and net worth as determined at the close of the previous taxable year is subtracted from the total at the close of the taxable year in question. The remainder, if any, is the increase for the taxable year, and if no adjustments are required, constitutes taxable income.\n\nHowever, where net worth increase is the income determinant, the Revenue Officer may, in making the final computation upon which to base the tax, add to the increase estimated living expenses incurred by the taxpayer since such expenditures are presumed to be made from income. The taxpayer on the other hand is entitled to have the income, as thus reconstructed, reduced by the amount of depreciation allowable on assets which are not considered in determining net worth.\n\nThe factors to be considered in reconstructing net worth are variable like availability of evidence and facts of the individual case control. But, generally speaking, net worth has been computed on the basis of some, all or a combination of the following:\n\na. bank records\n\nb. securities\n\nc. financial statements\n\nd. physical assets\n\ne. inventory\n\nf. all available records\n\nc. Determination of Opening Net Worth: The COHAN Rule\n\nThe difficulty of establishing the opening net worth of a taxpayer has led to the use of the Cohan rule to estimate or approximate the amount of cash at that time. The Cohan rule (established by the US Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals in Cohan vs. Commissioner) allows the use of estimates where the taxpayer lacks adequate records.\n\nC. Bank Deposit Method\n\nWhen the taxpayer's records are patently inaccurate or manifestly incomplete, the Revenue Officer (RO) may look to the bank deposits of the taxpayer as evidence income. Under the bank deposit method, the bank records of the taxpayer are analyzed and the Revenue Officer estimates income on the basis of the total bank deposits after eliminating non-income items. This method stands on the premise that deposits represent taxable income unless otherwise explained as being non-taxable items.\n\nWhile the mere making of a bank deposit does not prove the receipt of taxable income, once the Revenue Officer has made his determination, the burden is on the taxpayer to prove that various deposits did not stem from the receipt of taxable income. The passage of time makes it difficult for the taxpayer to meet this burden but this does not relieve him from showing the non-taxable source to contradict the Revenue Officer's determination. If the bank deposit method is used in support of a determination of fraud, however, the burden of proof is on the Revenue Officer. ADHcTE\n\nA showing that the deposits were made with frequency and regularity and that was a source of income from which deposits might have been derived, strengthens the use of the bank deposit method of reconstructing income. Expert testimony as to the maximum income the taxpayer could earn has been held insufficient to prevent the use of the bank deposit method.\n\nWhen computing taxable income under this method, it is appropriate to add to the bank deposit the amount of cash expenditures from unbanked funds for personal non-deductible purpose. Withdrawals which can be identified as deductible are allowed against the taxable income so determined.\n\nIn using the method, it is proper to prove the existence of a business and the practice of making deposit of business income into one or more bank accounts and then to adjust the total deposits for transfers, redeposits, deposits otherwise explained and finally to allow for ascertainable expenses, deductions and exemptions.\n\na. Analysis of Bank Deposits\n\nThe Revenue Officer's careful analysis of the taxpayer's bank deposits could well constitute the most important phase of his/her investigation. A review of the taxpayer's personal and business bank records for several months should be made. The following information/questions could be obtained from inspecting the taxpayer's deposits:\n\na.1. Are deposits made on a basis consistent with the information secured during the initial interview?\n\na.2. Are there any large or unusual deposits?\n\na.3. Are there any deposits from sources not reflected on the tax return?\n\na.4. The taxpayer's cancelled checks may reveal additional bank accounts not previously disclosed by the taxpayer.\n\na.5. Are there checks endorsed by the taxpayer and deposited into an account not previously disclosed?\n\na.6. Are there checks for assets or personal expenses that affect the taxpayer's-standard of living?\n\nb. Computation of Gross Receipts Through Bank Deposit Method\n\nDeposits may represent redeposited items and loans, in which event, taxable income as determined by the Revenue Officer should be reduced by such amounts. When there is evidence that some of the deposits were for non-taxable items and as such, there is no proof of the precise amount of taxable income, the Cohan principle may be resorted to. Deposits may also be shown to represent amounts on hand at the start of the year in which they are deposited rather than income in that year.\n\nThe bank deposit method like the net worth method, encompasses an area of uncertainty, thus though the taxpayer's records are inadequate for precise and complete verification of its return, a determination of income by the bank deposit method will be rejected if it is inconsistent with surrounding circumstances and gives an absurd result.\n\nD. Cash Expenditure Method\n\nAn outgrowth of the net worth method of determining income is the \"excess cash expenditure method\". This method assumes that the excess of a taxpayer's expenditures during a tax period over his reported income for that period is taxable to the extent not proved otherwise. The taxpayer may show that this excess resulted from non-taxable items such as loans, gifts, inheritance or assets on hand at the beginning of the period. AHaDSI\n\nWhile it has been said that no opening net worth is needed, when the cash expenditure method is used, the more impressive authority is to the contrary. The two steps involved in the cash expenditure method are: a) valuation of the taxpayer's assets at the beginning of the taxable period in order to determine the taxpayer's funds available for expenditure during the ensuing taxable period and b) determination of the amount by which expenditures exceeds reported income for the taxable period.\n\nTo show a failure to report the full amount of income by the use of this method, it must be demonstrated that the expenditures made during the taxable year were in excess of the available funds during the year which were reported on the tax return.\n\nTotal expenditures may not include checks drawn to cash and items for which the taxpayer has paid cash, unless the cash bank withdrawals were not used to pay for the cash expenditure. The burden is on the taxpayer to establish the relationship between the cash withdrawal and individual items. Expenditures may not necessarily come from income, but very large expenditures for personal purposes each year may be interpreted as an indication that the income being reported was too small.\n\nConsideration must be given to non-taxable sources of cash. Here, too, the difficulty of establishing the amount of cash at the starting point has led to the use of Cohan rule to estimate the cash available at the opening of the taxable period. The method has to be rejected when it gives an unrealistic result.\n\nProof in cash expenditure case may be difficult, for it is highly unusual for anyone to keep accurate records of personal living expenses. However, once the Revenue Officer has made a determination as to the amount of cash expenditures, the burden of proof to establish a different amount is on the taxpayer.\n\nE. Unit And Value Method\n\nThis is not considered as a primary method proof. The determination or verification of gross receipts may be computed by applying price and profit figures to the known ascertainable quality of business of the taxpayer. In addition, there are existing regulatory bodies to which the taxpayer reports units of production or service, some of which are:\n\na. records of sugar milled by a sugar central\n\nb. records of fish production to the Bureau of Fishery and Aquatic Resources\n\nc. records of production by pioneer and non-pioneer industries to the Board of Investments.\n\nE.1. Examples Using Unit and Value Method\n\nF. Third Party Information (Access to Records) Method\n\nThird party contracts are a source of information that should not be forgotten. The revenue officer determines when to make third party inquiries. The decision to make a third party inquiry is shaped by the size of the peso amount involved and the volume of the transaction. Third party inquiry through access to records can be time consuming. The revenue officer must weigh the benefits to be realized from this work against the time required to make an access to records and the availability of the needed information through other methods. The need for the revenue officer to obtain third party information is most often involved in our attempts to verify gross receipts.",

Closing Conference\n\nEssential to an effective audit of internal revenue tax liabilities is the holding of a closing conference with the taxpayer before the preparation of the final report of investigation by the Revenue Officer assigned to the tax case. During this time, the Revenue Officer and his Supervisor explains to the taxpayer how the assessment of his tax liability was arrived at. If necessary, the records of the case shall be presented to the taxpayer to document the Revenue Officer's findings. The taxpayer shall then be allowed to examine such records and to present his arguments. If the taxpayer agrees with the audit findings, he shall be made to sign an Agreement Form, if not, the Revenue Officer shall give the taxpayer enough time to document his objections to the proposed assessment. In both cases, the report of investigation shall be prepared and submitted to the Revenue District Officer for review and approval.\n\nUpon receipt of the report of investigation, the Revenue District Officer (RDO) shall send to the taxpayer a notice for informal conference. The notice should be accompanied by a summary of the Revenue Officer's (RO) findings. The notice shall be made in writing and sent to the taxpayer at the address indicated in his return or at his last known address. This notice, however, may be dispensed with in case the taxpayer agrees in writing to the proposed assessment, or where such proposed assessment has been paid.\n\nIn case the taxpayer responds to the notice within the period prescribed in the informal conference letter, he or his duly authorized representative shall again be allowed to examine the records of the case and to present his arguments in writing protesting the proposed assessment. Thereafter, the RDO shall, on the basis of the evidence on record, decide whether or not to approve the report before forwarding it to the Assessment Division for approval and issuance of the corresponding Termination Letter or Assessment Notice, as the case may be.\n\nIn the event the taxpayer fails to respond to the notice for informal conference within the prescribed period, or when the RDO finds the response to be without merit, the report of investigation shall be given due course and shall be forwarded to the Assessment Division for review.\n\nXIV. Report Making\n\nThe revenue officers are required to make a report after the investigation/audit has been conducted. Before starting to write a report, the revenue officer should have in mind a definite outline of the arrangement in which the facts and evidence may be presented in the most effective manner. A good general plan is to state the problem, present the results of the investigation and set forth the conclusions and recommendations.\n\nThe report to be prepared by the revenue officer in the conduct of his investigation shall contain the following:\n\nA Document Locator Form duly accomplished by the Revenue Officer wherein the dates when the docket was received and acted upon are indicated (BIR Form 23.02)\n\nB.

Ascertain if the taxpayer maintains branches or other business establishments other than its main office. TCAScE\n\na.3. Determine if the taxpayer is engaged in other lines of business aside from its principal undertaking.\n\na.4. Study the accounting methods and peculiarities in the industry group where the taxpayer belongs.\n\na.5. If possible, conduct interviews with responsible accounting and sales personnel to determine the degree of internal control.\n\na.6. Examine the quarterly value-added tax returns and monthly VAT declarations filed and check if all information are provided for.\n\na.7. Scrutinize the validation of payment on the VAT declaration/returns. Watch out for fake validations.\n\na.8. Refer to the report of the audit of the value-added tax liabilities of the taxpayer for the immediately preceding period to be aware of the deficiencies noted that may also be relevant in the audit of the current period.\n\na.9. Check reasonableness of sales and purchases together with output and input taxes declared. Verify mathematical computations.\n\na.10. Tally input tax carried over against the VAT return for the prior period.\n\na.11. Identify significant changes in sales and purchases and VAT payment from the immediately preceding period with the period under audit.\n\na.12. Obtain documentary requirements enumerated under Schedule V-6 hereto for claims for VAT credit/refund.\n\na.13. Request for the books of accounts and accounting records to be examined per Schedule V-7 hereof.\n\nb. Audit of Sales and Output Tax\n\nb.1. Gross Taxable Sale of Goods and Services\n\nb.1.1. Reconcile the amount of each category of sales per monthly VAT declarations, quarterly VAT returns and financial statements with the recorded amount of sales per general ledger, sales journal, including the control subsidiary sales ledger and any subsidiary sales journal for each branch.\n\nb.1.2. Review the composition of the sales account in the journals and ledgers and ascertain that:\n\nb.1.2.1. Only those transactions which are specifically exempted under Sec. 103 of the NIRC, are treated as exempt sales.\n\nb.1.2.2. \"Deemed\" sales of goods are recorded as taxable transactions:\n\nb.1.2.2.1. Transfer, use or consumption not in the course of business of goods or properties originally intended for sale or for use in the course of business. Transfer of goods or properties not in the course of business can take place when a VAT-registered person withdraws goods from his business for his personal use;\n\nb.1.2.2.2. Distribution or transfer to shareholders or investors as share in the profits of the VAT-registered person. Property dividends which are distributed to shareholders and declared out of retained earnings shall be subject to VAT based on the market value at the time of receipt;\n\nb.1.2.2.3. Transfer to creditors in payment of debt or obligation;\n\nb.1.2.2.4. Consignment of goods if actual sale is not made within 60 days following the date when such goods were consigned. Consigned goods returned by the consignee within the 60-day period is not deemed sold;\n\nb.1.2.2.5. Retirement from or cessation of business with respect to all goods on hand, whether capital goods, stock-in-trade, supplies or materials as of the date of such retirement or cessation, whether or not the business is continued by the new owner or successor.

Verify and compare entries appearing in the subsidiary and/or sales journal and compare the same with information shown in the sales invoices.\n\nb.1.4. Test the accuracy of the sales summary against the source documents.\n\nb.1.5. Determine compliance with invoicing requirements and procedures.\n\nb.1.5.1. Ascertain that invoices bear all necessary information as required under Sec. 108(a) and 238 of the NIRC.\n\nb.1.5.2. Verify authority to print receipts/invoices.\n\nb.1.6. Ensure that the sales invoices issued for sales transactions are all accounted for. Account for any break in the sequence of serial numbers of sales invoices and official receipts issued and invoices assigned to branches. In case of cancelled sales invoices, the original copy should be on file.\n\nb.1.7. For those using loose-leaf invoices/cash register machines, require presentation of authority to use the same.\n\nb.1.8. Be alert on the use of double or multiple set of invoices bearing identical serial numbers.\n\nb.1.9. Verify if the transactions covered by \"Statement of Account\", \"Delivery Receipt\", \"Debit Notes\" and other similar documents are properly recorded as sales. The mere issuance of these documents without the corresponding sales invoice is a violation of the bookkeeping regulations and an indication of unrecorded sales, except in the case of bona fide consignment sales.\n\nb.1.10. When confronted with a delivery receipt, ascertain whether it covers a consummated sale or consignment sale. Consignment sale shall be considered as taxable sale after sixty (60) days following the date of consignment.\n\nb.1.11. If the taxpayer is engaged in both taxable and exempt transactions, ascertain that only VAT invoices are issued for VAT taxable transactions and separate invoices are issued for exempt transactions.\n\nAny person whose sale of goods or services which are otherwise not subject to VAT but who issues a VAT invoice or receipt therefore shall, in addition to his liability to other applicable percentage tax, if any, be liable to VAT without benefit of any input credit.\n\nb.1.12. Test check footings in the sales and subsidiary sales journals and posting to the general ledger.\n\nb.1.13. Verify sales contracts, marketing agreements, consignment terms and other sales related documents.\n\nb.1.14. Scrutinize miscellaneous and other income accounts and ascertain if such accounts are taxable.\n\nb.1.15. Examine the cash receipts book and official receipts issued to uncover any collection which may not have been included in the taxable sale.\n\nb.1.16. Tour the company and plant premises and relate the equipments in use and the volume of business with the amount of sales declared for tax purposes.\n\nb.1.17. Be resourceful in discovering underdeclaration of sales. Abnormal levels of inventories, sales, purchases, accounts receivables, including manipulation of interbranch transactions, among others, may suggest instances of underdeclaration.\n\nb.1.18. If necessary, analyze all the accounts affecting total sales, particularly cash account, accounts and/or notes receivable, collections from receivables, sales discounts and sales returns, bad debts written off and other relevant accounts. ICAcHE\n\nIn the case of sale of service, include in the analysis other accounts such as advances, retention receivables, mobilization fees and other accounts.\n\n(See illustrations on Schedules V1-V4).\n\nb.1.19. Identify instances where the gross selling price of goods and services are unreasonably lower than the actual market value and make the necessary adjustments.\n\nb.1.20. If the accounting records are unreliable, look into gatepasses, purchase order registers and other records used by the taxpayer in its day-to-day transactions.\n\nb.1.21. Ascertain the correctness of output tax computation.\n\nb.1.22. Verify whether other charges such as excise tax, packaging, insurance, freight and delivery expenses are treated as part of the gross taxable sales. The excise tax, if any, shall form part of taxable sales.\n\nb.1.23. Account for deductions from sales such as:\n\nb.1.23.1. Discounts granted and determined at the time of sale which do not depend upon the happening of a future event expressly indicated on the face of the invoice and previously recorded in the books of accounts; and\n\nb.1.23.2. Sales returns and allowances for which proper credit or refund was made during the month or quarter to the buyer for sales previously recorded.\n\nb.1.24. In case the taxpayer enjoys full or partial exemption pursuant to special laws, verify the extent of exemption and compliance with the conditions set for the enjoyment of such exemptions. Compute the output tax by applying the factors prescribed under Executive Order No. 273.\n\nb.2. Zero-Rated and Foreign Currency Denominated Sales\n\nDetermine whether sales declared as zero-rated actually emanate from export sales or foreign currency denominated sales and other transactions that may qualify as zero-rated or effectively zero-rated sales.\n\nb.2.1. For actual export sales, review invoices, bills of lading, inward letters of credit, lending certificates and other commercial documents. Ascertain if the proceeds were paid for in acceptable foreign currency and inwardly remitted or its equivalent in goods or services in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP). Obtain schedule with the following information and check against supporting documents:\n\nb.2.1.1. Date of Export\n\nb.2.1.2. Sales Invoice No.\n\nb.2.1.3. Name of Consignee\n\nb.2.1.4.

Secure approval for zero-rating on export sales other than actual exports.\n\nb.2.3. For \"foreign currency denominated sales\", review the transactions and ascertain if:\n\nb.2.3.1. the buyer is a non-resident;\n\nb.2.3.2. the goods are assembled or manufactured in the Philippines;\n\nb.2.3.3. the goods are to be delivered to a resident in the Philippines; and\n\nb.2.3.4. The goods are paid for and inwardly remitted in acceptable foreign currency and accounted for in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP).\n\nb.2.4. For zero-rated sale of services, verify contract agreement to ascertain the person for whom the services were rendered, amount of consideration, description of the services, and documents evidencing actual payments. Determine if proceeds of sale in foreign currency were inwardly remitted in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas. Prepare schedule with the following information:\n\nb.2.4.1. Name of Contractee\n\nb.2.4.2. Contract Price\n\nb.2.4.3. Amount Billed in Foreign Currency\n\nb.2.4.4.

For other effectively zero-rated transactions, secure copy of the application approved by the Revenue District Office. Without an approved application, the transaction otherwise entitled to zero-rating shall be considered taxable.\n\nc. Audit of Purchases and Input Tax\n\nc.1. Reconcile the amount of each category of purchases per VAT declarations and returns with the amount of purchases per subsidiary purchases journal. Check if all the information required are maintained in the purchase journal.\n\nc.2. Analyze and compare the summary of purchases with entries appearing in the subsidiary purchase journals, purchase journal, purchase invoices and other source documents.\n\nc.3. Review the composition of the purchase accounts in the journals and ledgers and ascertain that:\n\nc.3.1. Purchases from non-VAT and/or exempt persons do not result in any input tax credit.\n\nc.3.2. Effectively zero-rated purchases do not result in any input tax credit.\n\nc.3.3. Purchases from VAT persons, which are personal in nature, shall not give rise to input tax credit.\n\nc.4. Determine substantiation of claims for input tax credits.\n\nc.4.1. For domestic purchases of goods and services in the course of trade or business, these must be supported by VAT invoices or receipts showing the information required in Sec. 108 (a) and 238 of the Code. The printer's authority to print must likewise be indicated on the face of the invoice or receipt. A cash register machine tape shall not constitute valid proof of input tax credit.\n\nc.4.2. Credit for input tax on importation shall be supported with import entries or other equivalent documents showing actual payment of VAT on the imported goods. VAT payment must be based on the total value used by the Bureau of Customs in determining tariff and customs duties, plus customs duties, excise taxes, if any, and other charges prior to the release of the goods from customs custody, such as postage, commissions and similar charges. In case the valuation used is by volume or quantity, the landed cost which consists of the invoice amount, customs duties, freight, insurance and other charges and excise taxes, if any, shall be the basis for computing the value-added tax.\n\nc.4.3. VAT invoices issued for exempt and zero-rated transactions will not generate input credits to the purchaser.\n\nc.5. Determine correctness of computation of claims for input tax credits.\n\nc.6. Check the authenticity of substantial claims of input tax credits by confirming purchase transactions through, but not limited to:\n\nc.6.1. Access to supplier's records\n\nc.6.2. Comparing purchases of other taxpayers belonging to the same industry.\n\nc.6.3. Test checking payments of representative sample of purchases against check vouchers and cancelled checks.\n\nc.7. Ascertain that purchase returns or allowances granted to the taxpayer and input tax attributable to exempt sales results in a corresponding reduction in the input tax credit balance. (See illustration on Schedule V-5.)\n\nIf a VAT-registered person is also engaged in exempt activities, the input taxes paid for purchase of goods or services which cannot be attributed to either operation shall be allocated between the VAT taxable operation and the non-VAT operation using the above computation. The amount allocated to the exempt transaction should reduce the input tax credit balance.\n\nc.8. Applications for the issuance of tax credit certificates and refund affecting the input tax credit accounts must reduce the input tax credit available at the time of application. These shall include not only applications filed with the Bureau of Internal Revenue but also those filed with the Department of Finance, the Board of Investments and the Bureau of Customs.\n\nc.9. Reconcile the amounts of input tax claimed in the VAT return for the portion carried over from previous quarters and the balance carried to succeeding quarters with the amounts recorded in the books of accounts.\n\nc.10.

Check whether the correct amount of tax has been withheld and remitted within the prescribed period. Otherwise, impose appropriate penalties for non-withholding or non-remittance of the tax, as the case may be.\n\nESTATE TAX\n\n(Ref. - RR 17-93, RAMO 2-82, RAMO 1-82, RAMO 1-80)\n\nThe following audit procedures were culled from existing revenue issuances. They enumerate the steps to be taken by a Revenue Officer in the processing, verification and investigation of estate tax returns and unverified income tax returns of resident and non-resident decedents subject to estate tax. However, these do not preclude the application of other audit procedures as warranted by the circumstances surrounding each case.\n\n1. The estate tax return of a decedent and all his unverified income tax returns for the last three years prior to his death shall be simultaneously investigated by a revenue officer or a group of revenue officers.\n\nThe revenue officer should see to it that an income tax return covering the income and deductions of the decedent from January 1 to the date of his death has been filed. Although the period covered by the return consists of less than twelve (12) months, such period shall be considered as a \"taxable year\".\n\n2. If the settlement of the estate of the decedent is the object of judicial testamentary or intestate proceedings, ascertain if: aDcTHE\n\na. An income tax return for the estate as a taxable person has been filed by the fiduciary or administrator. \u2014\n\nThe estate's income tax return shall cover the income and deductions of the estate for the period from the date immediately following the death of the decedent to the end of the taxable year. Thereafter, annually a return for the estate shall be filed until the estate is terminated.\n\nor\n\nb. An individual return for each of the spouses, heirs/beneficiaries has been filed covering their respective income and deductions for the period from the date immediately following the death of the decedent to the end of the taxable year. \u2014\n\nSuch individual income tax returns shall include the income received by them from the estate.\n\nIf the settlement of the estate is not the object of judicial testamentary or intestate proceedings, verify if the income of the properties left by the decedent is included in the income tax return of each heir or beneficiary according to his distributive share in the net income of the estate or co-ownership.\n\n3. Verify if a Notice of Death was filed within two (2) months after the decedent's death where the gross value of the estate exceeds three thousand pesos (P3,000.00). In case of failure to file the notice, impose the appropriate penalty provided by the Tax Code. However, the Notice of Death may also be filed without penalty within two (2) months after the qualification of the executor or administrator. This contemplates the filing of estate proceedings in court and the appointment of the executor or administrator by the court.\n\n4. Determine if the value of the gross estate is fifty thousand pesos (P50,000.00) or more. If in the affirmative, check whether the estate tax return is accompanied by a certified statement of an independent Certified Public Accountant showing the following information:\n\na. Itemized assets of the decedent with their corresponding gross value at the time of his death, or in the case of a non-resident alien, of that part of his gross estate situated in the Philippines; and\n\nb. Itemized deductions from gross estate allowed under Sec. 79 of the Tax Code.\n\nAfter which, thoroughly examine the inventory of assets and liabilities submitted with the estate tax return to determine whether there are assets and/or liabilities not reported in the said return. Prepare an adjusted schedule of assets and liabilities as basis in computing the yearly increase in the net worth of the taxpayer up to the time of his death.\n\n5. Inquire into the historical acquisition of the property left by the decedent, whether it was acquired by purchase, donation or inheritance, for the purpose of ascertaining if such property is conjugal, exclusive or the paraphernal property of the deceased.\n\n6. Scrutinize the provisions of the insurance policies taken out by the deceased upon his own life as to whether the designation of the beneficiary is revocable or irrevocable. If revocable, the proceeds of the life insurance shall be included in the gross estate. If irrevocable, the proceeds thereof shall be excluded from the gross estate. However, the proceeds of the life insurance shall be included in the gross estate, irrespective of whether or not the insured retained the power of revocation, if the beneficiary named in the policy is the estate of the decedent.\n\n7. Verify if the land, specially urban land, includes improvements and buildings. Secure a certification from the Assessor's Office as to the existence or non-existence of improvements on the land. If possible, an ocular inspection of the land should be undertaken.\n\n8. Conduct third party verification an certain government agencies such as the Office of the Register of Deeds, Securities and Exchange Commission, Land Transportation Office, Office of the Provincial, City or Municipal Assessor for possible properties listed and registered in the name of the decedent which have not been included in the estate tax return.\n\n9. Inquire into the bank deposits or other investments of the decedent. The Commissioner is authorized under Section 16 of the Tax Code to look into the bank deposits of a decedent for estate tax purposes, the provisions of Republic Act No. 1405 notwithstanding. Foreign currency, if any, shall be valued at their current foreign exchange rate.\n\n10. Ascertain if the shares of stocks are properly valued. In doing so, observe the following rules on valuation pursuant to RAMO 1-82:\n\na. For stocks listed or traded in the stock market\n\na.1. The selling price shall be used where there are sales made on the valuation date. The mean between the highest and lowest selling prices on valuation dates shall be the fair market value per share.\n\na.2. If there were no sales on the valuation date but there were sales on dates within a reasonable period both before and after the valuation date, the fair market value is determined by taking the weighted average of the mean between the highest and the lowest sales in the nearest trading date after the valuation date. The average is to be weighted inversely by the respective number of trading days between the selling dates and the valuation date. The reasonable period of valuation must not exceed six months before or after the valuation date.\n\nExample:\n\nThe valuation date is January 15, Friday. Sales of stock occurred on January 13, Wednesday or two trading days before valuation date at P10.00 and on Wednesday, January 20, three days after valuation date at P15.00, the fair market value of the shares to be taken is P12.00 computed as follows:\n\n(3 x P10) + (2 x P15) = P30 + P30 = 60 = P12.00\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \u2014\u2014\n\n5 5 5\n\na.3. If actual sales of the shares are not available during a reasonable period beginning before and ending after the valuation date, the fair market value may be determined by taking the mean between the bona fide bid and asked prices on the valuation date, or if none, by taking the weighted average of the mean between the bona fide bid and asked prices on the nearest trading date before and after the valuation date within a reasonable period in accordance with the formula in the preceding paragraph.\n\na.4. If there are no sales or bona fide bid and asked prices available on a date within a reasonable period before the valuation date, but such prices are available on a date within a reasonable period after the valuation date, or vice versa, then the mean between the highest and lowest available sale prices or bid and asked prices nearest the valuation date may be taken as the value of the shares.\n\na.5. If it is established that the selling or bid and asked prices as provided in the foregoing paragraphs do not reflect the fair market value thereof, some reasonable modification of that basis or other relevant facts and element of value may be considered. In certain exceptional cases, the size of the block of the stock to be valued in relation to the number of shares changing hands in sales may affect adversely the fair market value of the stocks to be valued.\n\nb. For unlisted stocks or stocks not quoted or traded in the stock market\n\nb.1. In general, the unlisted shares shall be valued at their book value nearest the valuation date. The book value of these unlisted shares of stock shall be prima facie considered as their fair market value.\n\nb.2. In case the shares are valued on a basis lower than their book values, a justification for the deviation from the book value, together with the evidences in support thereof, should be submitted. The following factors are considered relevant in the valuation of shares of stock of closed corporations:\n\nb.2.1. The nature of the business and the financial history of the enterprise, from the date of the incorporation.\n\nb.2.2. The economic outlook in general and the business condition and outcome of the specific industry in particular.\n\nb.2.3. The financial condition of the business\n\nb.2.4. The earning capacity of the company\n\nb.2.5. The dividend paying capacity\n\nb.2.6. Goodwill\n\nb.2.7. Sales of stocks and size of the block of stock to be valued\n\nb.2.8. Market price of stocks of corporations engaged in the same or similar line of business to be valued\n\nb.2.9. Existence of corporate debts in favor of the family of the principal shareholder\n\nb.2.10. Restrictive agreements impairing the alienability of the stock\n\nb.2.11. Investments in business or property maintained at a deficit\n\nb.2.12. Dividend arrearages\n\nb.2.13. Voting rights of stockholders\n\nb.2.14. Difficulty in liquidating the assets.\n\nIf such lower fair market valuation is not clearly established and documented, the book value of the unlisted shares of stocks shall be adopted. If there have been previous bona fide sales/exchanges of the unlisted shares of stock, the price at which these shares exchange hands should be taken/considered as its fair market value/s.\n\nc. Preferred shares of stocks shall always be valued at par.\n\n11. Audit of itemized deductions under Section 79 of the Tax Code:\n\na. Funeral Expenses \u2014\n\nRequire the submission of invoices or official receipts evidencing actual funeral expenses. Only actual funeral expenses in an amount equal to 5% of the gross estate or P100,000.00, whichever is lower, may be allowed as a deduction from gross estate.\n\nb. Judicial Expenses \u2014\n\nCheck if the settlement of the estate is the object of judicial testamentary or intestate proceedings. If not, no deduction for judicial expenses shall be allowed. However, a reasonable amount for legal fees and accounting expenses incurred in the settlement of the estate of the decedent may be allowed. Scrutinize legal fees deducted in the estate tax return by checking the nature of the payment, the person to whom it was paid and the date of payment.\n\nc. Claims Against The Estate \u2014\n\nc.1. Verify if the claim is subject to Mortgage Redemption Insurance (MRI). If in the affirmative, disallow deduction claimed\n\nc.2. In the verification of claims against the estate, secure certified true copies of the following documents and scrutinize them:\n\nc.2.1. duly notarized promissory notes or contract of loan signed by the debtor if the loan was contracted within three years before the death of the decedent. Check the statement submitted by the administrator or executor regarding the disposition of the proceeds of the loan. If the administrator or executor fails to satisfactorily explain, in whole or in part, the disposition of the proceeds of the loan contracted within three (3) years before the death of the decedent, such proceeds or a portion thereof may be included as cash in the gross estate;\n\nc.2.2. vouchers, cancelled checks or other documents evidencing the advances made by individuals or corporations to the deceased;\n\nc.2.3. latest balance sheet of the corporation; and HCSDca\n\nc.2.4. other documents or evidences relevant to the grant of the loan, i.e., real estate or chattel mortgage, a copy of the Transfer Certificate of Title to show annotations thereof.\n\nc.2.4.1. Where the settlement is made through the court in a testate or intestate proceeding, scrutinize pertinent documents filed with the court evidencing claims against the estate or the court order approving the said claims if already issued.\n\nc.2.4.2. Obtain a sworn certification from the creditor as to the exact balance of the liability of the deceased. The certification must be duly signed by the president, vice-president or other principal officer of the corporation in case the creditor is a corporation.\n\nEnsure that the creditor agrees in writing allowing the verification by the Revenue Officer of his pertinent records for the purpose of substantiating the claims against the estate of the deceased.\n\nd. Claims Against Insolvent Persons \u2014\n\nd.1. Determine if the Account or Notes Receivable has been included as part of the gross estate. If not, disallow deduction.\n\nd.2. Find out if the claims against insolvent persons may be considered as conjugal or separate property of the decedent. In case the claim is the exclusive or paraphernal property of the decedent, the same should not be considered in the computation of the share of the surviving spouse.\n\ne. Vanishing Deduction (Property Previously Taxed) \u2014\n\nAscertain compliance with all of the following conditions in order that the claim for vanishing deduction may be allowed:\n\ne.1. The prior decedent must have died or the donation was made within five (5) years before the decedent's death.\n\ne.2. The property subject of the vanishing deduction must be the same property inherited or donated from the prior decedent or donor.\n\ne.3. The vanishing deduction is based on the value of the property at the time of the donation or death of the prior decedent or at the time of the death of the present decedent, whichever is lower. The deduction is based on the value of each individual property.\n\ne.4. The estate tax or donor's tax due on the donation or estate of the prior decedent must have been paid.\n\nf. Transfers For Public Use \u2014\n\nf.1. Failure to comply with any of the following requisites will result in the disallowance of the deduction:\n\nf.1.1. The transferee is the government or any political subdivision thereof and the transfer is exclusively for public purpose.\n\nf.1.2. The transfer must be by way of a last will and testament or donation mortis causa executed by the deceased before his death.\n\ng. Losses \u2014\n\nExamine closely the losses being claimed as a deduction from gross estate. Disallow the deduction if any of the following conditions is absent:\n\ng.1. The property lost must have been included in the gross estate.\n\ng.2. The loss must not have been compensated for by insurance, in whole or in part.\n\ng.3. The loss must not have been claimed as a deduction for income tax purposes.\n\ng.4. The loss must have been incurred not later than six (6) months (last day for payment of the estate tax) after the decedent's death.\n\n12.

Valuation of Family Home. \u2014\n\nThe decedent's family home shall be appraised as of the time of his death, at its current or fair market value or zonal value, whichever is higher.\n\nb. Conditions for the allowance of Family Home as a deduction from the gross estate:\n\nb.1. The family home must be the actual residential home of the decedent and his family at the time of his death, as certified to by the Barangay Captain of the locality where the family home is situated;\n\nb.2. The total value of the family home must be included as part of the gross estate of a person who died on or after July 28, 1992, the date of effectivity of R.A. 7499; and\n\nb.3. Allowable deduction must be in an amount equivalent to the fair market value or zonal value of the family home as declared or included in the gross estate but not exceeding P1,000,000.\n\nTo illustrate:\n\nNote: Although the family home is valued at P2 million, the maximum allowable deduction for the family home is P1 million only.\n\nNote: Deduction for family home is allowed for P800,000 only which is the declared value of the home.\n\n2. Decedent is a married man with surviving spouse:\n\na. The family home is his exclusive property \u2014\n\nNote: Family home allowance of P1,000,000 is considered as one item of deduction after the computation and deduction of the net share of the surviving spouse in the conjugal property.\n\nc. Same facts and figures as in (b) except for family home which has a fair market value/zonal value of only P1,500,000.\n\nNote: Since the fair market value/zonal value of Family home (Conjugal) in the above example is P1,500,000, the Family home deduction corresponding to \u00bd of such fair market value/zonal value is P750,000 only. CTIDcA\n\nd. Family home is conjugal property, but lot on which it stands is exclusive property.\n\n13. In case of death of an individual who is a VAT-registered person, verify if the value-added tax (VAT) has been paid or imposed on the transfer or transmission of the business assets to the heirs, even if the estate or the heirs of the decedent continue to operate the business. If the business assets are conjugal, only one-half (\u00bd), representing the share of the deceased, is subject to value-added tax. CTcSIA\n\nDONOR'S TAX\n\n(Ref. RAMO 1-82)\n\nAn outline of the audit procedures which may be followed by a Revenue Officer for the immediate processing and proper verification of donor's tax returns is provided hereunder.\n\na. Determine whether the donor's tax return has been filed within thirty (30) days from the date of donation. If not, impose penalties incident to late filing and late payment of the tax.\n\nb. Verify if the donor has made previous donations during the same taxable year from existing records available in the Revenue District Office or the Assessment Division for the purpose of determining how much is the gross gift to date.\n\nc. Ascertain authenticity of the following documents:\n\nc.1 Deed of Donation\n\nc.2 Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT)/Condominium Certificate of Title (CCT)/Original Certificate of Title (OCT), for real properties\n\nc.3 Latest Tax Declaration, for real properties\n\nd. If donation involves shares of stocks, verify proper valuation thereof by following the procedures prescribed under RAMO 1-82 (see procedure No. 10 in the .investigation of the estate tax liabilities of the decedent).\n\ne. Determine whether the essential elements of a gift are present.\n\nf. Ascertain whether the gross gift has been valued either at adjusted fair market value or zonal value, whichever is higher, at the time of the donation.\n\ng. Determine the relation between the donor and the donee for the imposition of the proper donor's tax rate.\n\nh. Verify if the donation of the land includes improvements and buildings. Secure a certification from the Assessor's Office as to the existence or non-existence of improvements on the land subject of the donation. Donation of the land ordinarily includes the improvements unless specifically excluded in the Deed of Donation.\n\ni. If a deduction is claimed, like liabilities or mortgage required to be assumed by the donee as a condition of the donation:\n\na. Ascertain the balance of the indebtedness as of the time of the gift.\n\nb. Verify the genuineness of the deduction claimed and require the submission of pertinent documents in support of the deduction.\n\nc. Verify if the assumption of the liability is expressly stipulated in the Deed of Donation and is duly accepted by the donee. Otherwise, the claimed deduction should be disallowed.\n\nCAPITAL GAINS TAX ON SALE, TRANSFER\n\nOR EXCHANGE OF REAL PROPERTY\n\nUNDER SECTION 21 (e) OF THE TAX CODE\n\n(Ref. - RAMO 2-91, RR 13-85)\n\nThis section equips the Revenue Officer with the minimum audit steps prescribed by existing revenue issuances in the proper determination of the correct capital gains tax due on the sale, transfer or exchange of real properties. Additional audit techniques may be employed by the Revenue Officer depending on the complexity and materiality of the transactions involved.\n\na. Ascertain authenticity of the following documents:\n\na.1 Deed of Sale/Transfer or Exchange\n\na 2 Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT)/Condominium Certificate of Title (CCT)/Original Certificate of Title (OCT)\n\na.3 Latest Tax Declaration\n\nb. For disposition of real property without any improvement, authenticate the certificate executed by the City/Provincial/Municipal Assessor on the non-existence of improvement on the real property being sold, transferred or exchanged.\n\nc. Corroborate value of property subject of sale by conducting an ocular inspection.\n\nd. Review computation of the tax base for land and improvement in accordance with the following schedules \u2014\n\nd.1 When the zonal value of land has been established\n\nd.1.1. Determine value of improvements by using the formulas shown below:\n\ne. In case of installment sales, determine whether the taxpayer is qualified to report his gain under the installment basis. An individual is qualified to account for his gain on installment basis if the initial payment does not exceed 25% of the selling price. The term \"initial payment\" means the payment or payments which the seller receives before or upon execution of the instrument of sale and payments which he expects or is scheduled to receive in cash or property (other than evidence of indebtedness of the purchaser) during the taxable year of sale or disposition.\n\nExample: Assume that on October 15, 1986, an individual sold for P100,000 a real property with an adjusted basis of P60,000 under the following terms: P10,000 upon execution of sale; the balance of P90,000 in 18 equal monthly installments of P5,000 each beginning November 15, 1986. The taxpayer qualifies to pay the capital gains tax on installment because the initial payment consisting of the amount of P10,000 he received upon sale and the amount he expects or is scheduled to receive \u2014 P5,000 on November 15, 1986 and P5,000 on December 15, 1986, or a total of P20,000 during the year of sale do not exceed 25% of the selling price.\n\ne.1. Computation of amount of tax payable on installments. If the taxpayer qualifies and elects to pay the capital gains tax in installments, the tax may be paid in installments, the amount of each installment of which shall be the proportion of the tax so determined which \u2014\n\ne.1.1. on the date of sale or disposition, first payment (amount received, including the excess of the mortgage, if any, assumed by the purchaser over the basis of the property sold) and\n\ne.1.2. in succeeding payments, the installment payment received by the seller bears to the total contract price.\n\nIllustrations:\n\nExample 1. Assume that on October 1, 1986 an individual sold a piece of real property with an adjusted basis of P60,000 for P100,000 under the following terms: P20,000 down payment; balance in five annual installments beginning 1987. Taxpayer elects and is qualified to pay the tax in installments. The periodic payment of the tax is computed as follows:\n\nPortion of the tax payable upon sale or upon receipt of first payment is determined as follows:\n\n[First payment/Contract price] X Total Tax Due = Portion of Tax Payable\n\nor\n\n[P20,000/P100,000] X P5,000 = P1,000\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nPortion of the tax payable annually for five years beginning 1987 is computed as follows\n\nExample 2: Assume that in 1969, an individual acquired a property for P60,000. In 1986, he sold the property for P100,000. Terms of sale: Down payment, October 1, 1986, P10,000; mortgage assumed, P40,000; balance payable in four annual installments beginning January 2, 1987. The taxpayer elects to pay the tax on the gain in installments.\n\nThe tax payments on installments received is computed as follows:\n\nExample 3. Assume that in 1986, an individual sold for P100,000 a piece of real property which he bought in 1980 for P40,000. Prior to sale, the property was mortgaged for P60,000 The terms of sale are as follows: Down payment, P10,000; assumption of unpaid mortgage, P50,000; balance of P40,000 payable in four semi-annual payments beginning January 15, 1987. The taxpayer elects to pay the tax in installments. Amount of tax payable in installments is computed follows:\n\nf. Confirm payment of Capital Gains Tax by cross-checking the payment thereof with the Batch Control Sheet prepared by the bank or the Collection Officer, as the case may be.\n\ng. When there is delay in the presentation of sales documents, require the taxpayer to submit documents such as cancelled checks, official receipts or certification of the archive official to show that there is no ante-dating of public instrument. The rules and regulations applicable at the date of execution of the contract shall be applied and the increments for late filing and payment of tax shall be imposed.\n\nIf the taxpayer cannot show proofs that-the-same is not ante-dated, the rules applicable at the time of presentation of the document shall be applied.\n\nXVI General Policies in the Investigation of Tax Fraud Cases\n\nA. Jurisdiction\n\n1. Tax Fraud Division\n\n1.1 The Tax Fraud Division (TFD) shall have jurisdiction to conduct or undertake the investigation and/or reinvestigation of cases referred to or developed by the Division, and those assigned, referred or approved by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue.\n\n2. Special Investigation Division (SID)\n\n2.1 The SID shall have jurisdiction over the following cases:\n\n2.1.1. Tax fraud cases referred to it by the Intelligence and Investigation Service (IIS).\n\n2.1.2 Tax fraud cases initiated and developed by the SID.\n\n2.1.3 Tax fraud cases referred to it by the RDO.\n\n3. Revenue District Offices\n\n3.1. If in the course of the regular examination of returns, indications of fraud were discovered, the RDO must transmit the records of the case immediately to the SID and provide assistance in the formal investigation thereof.\n\nThis shall be considered sufficient compliance with RMO 44-93.\n\nB. Procedure\n\nA Preliminary Investigation must first be conducted to establish the prima facie existence of fraud. This shall include the verification of the allegations on the confidential informations and/or complaints filed, and the determination of the schemes and extent of fraud perpetrated by the denounced taxpayers.\n\nThe Formal Fraud Investigation, which includes the examination of the taxpayers' books of accounts through the issuance of Letters of Authority, shall be conducted only after the prima facie existence of fraud has been established.\n\n1. Tax Fraud Division\n\n1.1 Where indications of fraud have been established in a preliminary investigation, the TFD through the Assistant Commissioner, Intelligence and Investigation Service (IIS), shall request/recommend the issuance of the corresponding Letter of Authority by the Commissioner which will automatically supersede all previously issued Letters of Authority with respect thereto.\n\n1.2 Thereafter, a copy thereof shall be immediately furnished the RDO and/or the SID of the Revenue Region having jurisdiction over the taxpayer, who, upon receipt thereof, must immediately transmit to the TFD all the documents in their possession relative thereto and must withdraw and cancel any issued Letter of Authority therefor.\n\nNo Letter of Authority shall be issued for any taxpayer already covered by a Letter of Authority issued by the Commissioner.\n\n1.3 Reports on cases recommended for criminal prosecution shall be forwarded to the Assistant Commissioner, Legal Service, Attn: Litigation and Prosecution Division, through the IIS. However, if after evaluation the Litigation and Prosecution Division resolves that the evidence is not sufficient to warrant the filing of a criminal action against subject taxpayer, the case shall be referred back to the TFD through the IIS, for further documentation and/or appropriate action.\n\n1.4. No Assessment Notice shall be served upon any taxpayer recommended for criminal prosecution for tax evasion, following the Supreme Court's ruling in the case of Ungab vs. Cusi, 97 SCRA 877. HAaECD\n\n1.5. All other reports on cases not recommended for criminal prosecution shall be forwarded to the Commissioner, through the IIS, for approval.\n\n2. Special Investigation Division\n\n2.1. The Chief of the SID shall issue the corresponding Letter of Authority if the prima facie existence of fraud has been established, and the same has been confirmed by the Regional Tax Fraud Committee (RTFC), composed of the following:\n\nThe RDO shall then desist from issuing any Letter of Authority to the taxpayer concerned, and shall transmit to the SID all the documents in its possession relative thereto.\n\nHowever, the RDO may assign one Revenue Officer, whose name shall be included in the Letter of Authority as the \"RDO Assisting Revenue Officer'' (RARO), to assist and coordinate with the SID in the formal investigation.\n\n2.2. Where the SID has established the prima facie existence of fraud against a taxpayer who has been the subject of an on-going or terminated investigation by the RDO, the SID shall nevertheless forward the records of the case for evaluation to the RTFC.\n\nIf after evaluation the RTFC confirms to the SID the prima facie existence of fraud, the following procedures shall followed:\n\n2.2.1 Where the investigation is on-going \u2014 the RDO concerned shall withdraw its Letter of Authority and immediately cease and desist from further investigation. The records of the case shall then be forwarded to the SID concerned which, thereafter, shall issue a Letter of Authority and proceed with the formal fraud investigation.\n\n2.2.2 Where investigation is already terminated \u2014 the office who has the possession of the records shall upon written request, immediately forward the records to the SID concerned.\n\nIf a re-investigation is necessary, the SID shall forwarded the same to the IIS with a recommendation for the issuance of the corresponding Letter of Authority by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue.\n\n2.3. Where the business activities and/or establishments are situated in more than one revenue region, the tax fraud case must be referred to the TFD through the IIS. ACIDTE\n\n2.4. If after conducting the preliminary investigation the prima facie existence of fraud cannot be established, but a potential deficiency tax assessment exists, the case shall be referred to the RDO concerned for appropriate action.\n\n2.5. Reports on cases recommended for criminal prosecution shall be forwarded to the Legal Division of the Revenue Region. If after evaluation the Legal Division resolves that the evidence is not sufficient to warrant the filing of a criminal action against subject taxpayer, the case shall be referred back to the SID, for further documentation and/or appropriate action.\n\n2.6. Reports on cases not recommended for criminal prosecution shall be forwarded to the Assessment Division of the Region.\n\n3. Revenue District Offices\n\n3.1 Upon discovery of the indication(s) of fraud during the regular examination of the returns, the Revenue Officer should make a detailed report thereof to Revenue District Officer who shall immediately transmit the records of the case to the SID.\n\n3.2. The RDO shall then assign a RARO to assist and coordinate with the SID in the investigation of the said case.\n\nC. Civil Fraud\n\nIn case the quantum of evidence gathered does not warrant a criminal prosecution because it is not sufficient to prove the guilt of the taxpayer beyond reasonable doubt, but there exists a clear and convincing evidence that fraud has been committed, a corresponding 50% surcharge shall nevertheless be imposed.\n\nA P P E N D I X\n\nGUIDELINES AND INVESTIGATIVE PROCEDURES\n\nIN THE DEVELOPMENT OF TAX FRAUD CASES\n\nFOR INTERNAL REVENUE OFFICERS\n\nA. OBJECTIVES:\n\nThe substantial revenue collections of the government derived from the series of tax amnesties signify to a large degree that the BIR has not effectively tapped a great number of potential sources of revenues. The tremendous shortfall in revenue collections for the preceding year should spur the BIR on the need for a more systematic and vigorous tax campaign by instilling more awareness and tax consciousness among our taxpayers, more especially those who have continuously flaunted our revenue laws with impunity.\n\nTo provide a strong deterrent to the commission of fraud against the revenues for the purpose of increasing and enhancing our revenue collections, the imposition of criminal sanctions, in addition to the civil liabilities, on erring taxpayers should be implemented to the fullest extent of the law in line with the pronouncement of the President of the Philippines.\n\nThese guidelines are, therefore, presented to guide and to refresh all internal revenue officers with the necessary know-how in the investigation, evaluation, and submission of reports of fraud cases envisioned to withstand judicial scrutiny.\n\nB. NATURE AND TYPES OF FRAUD\nDefinition \u2014 fraud or evasion\n\nTax fraud or evasion means the elimination or reduction of one's correct and proper tax by fraudulent means. \"The fraud contemplated by law is actual and not constructive. It must be intentional fraud, consisting of deception, willfully and deliberately done or resorted to in order to induce another to give some legal right. . . . \" Aznar vs. CTA and Collector, Gr#L-20569,. Aug. 25, 1974.\nFactors in Fraud or Evasion\n\nAll the following elements must be proven by competent evidences to establish the existence of fraud:\n\n1. The end to be achieved \u2014 the payment of less tax than that known by the taxpayer to be legally due.\n\n2. The accompanying state of mind which is variously described as being; evil\", \"in bad faith\", \"deliberate and not accidental\", or \"willful\" \u2014 the exact term used is not too important.\n\n3. The overt act done or scheme used by the taxpayer to achieve the non-payment of taxes known to be due. The act or scheme must be tinged with some elements of deceit, misrepresentation, trick, device, concealment or dishonesty. Fraud under Tax Law, Balter.\n\nBurden of Proof in Establishing Fraud\n\nA tax fraud or evasion case is basically a criminal case.\n\nIn the establishment of fraud, the burden of proof is on the Bureau of Internal Revenue. The presumption that an officer of the government has performed his duty regularly (.Section 5, Rule 131 of the New Rules of Court), as in the case of the correctness of deficiency assessments, is not applicable in fraud cases. \"In criminal cases, the burden of proof as to the offense charged lies on the prosecution.\"(Section 2, Rule 131, New Rules of Court).\n\nMere suspicions and mere doubts on the intention of the taxpayer are not sufficient proof of fraud. Fraud is never presumed; it must be proved.\n\nTypes of Tax Fraud Cases\n\nCriminal Fraud \u2014\n\nA criminal tax fraud case results when all the elements of fraud can be proven beyond reasonable doubt. Proof beyond reasonable doubt does not mean such a degree of proof as, excluding possibility of error, produces absolute certainty. Moral certainty is only required, or that degree of proof which produces conviction in an unprejudiced mind.\n\nHere, the taxpayer upon conviction shall be liable aside from the deficiency taxes, to both criminal and civil penalties.\n\nCivil Fraud \u2014\n\nA civil tax fraud case results when all the elements of fraud cannot be proven beyond reasonable doubt, but rather by clear and convincing evidence amounting to more than a mere preponderance, and cannot be justified by mere speculation.\n\n\"Preponderance of evidence\" means that the testimony adduced by one side is more creditable and conclusive than that of the other.\n\n\"Clear and convincing\" need not rise to proof beyond reasonable doubt as in a criminal case but yet must be stronger than mere preponderance of evidence.\n\nHere, the taxpayer shall be liable aside from the deficiency taxes only to the civil penalties.\n\nEffects of Fraud under the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC)\n\n1. Civil penalties giving rise to the imposition of the 50%, surcharge; to be imposed by the BIR;\n\n2. Criminal penalties involving the imposition of penal sanctions \u2014 imprisonment and/or fine to be imposed by the Regional Trial Court (RTC) upon conviction;\n\n3. Power of the Commissioner to assess and collect the tax is extended to 10 years from date of discovery, however, Sec. 280 provides the five year prescription on the filing of criminal action;\n\n4. Cases involving fraud cannot be the subject of compromise as mandated by Section 204, NIRC;\n\n5. Suspension and temporary closure of the business operations of a taxpayer under Sections 111 of Tax Code for violation of the VAT provisions.\n\nC. METHODS OF PROVING FRAUD IN CRIMINAL AND CIVIL TAX FRAUD CASES\n\n1. The Direct Approach Method or by Direct Evidence, also called Specific item Cases \u2014 Proof of fraudulent acts are adduced by specific items of fraudulent transactions. It is that one, if the allegations are believed, the existence of the principal or ultimate fact is proven without any inference or presumption.\n\nSpecific Item Cases determined by the direct approach method. \u2014\n\nThe following are mere examples of fraudulent act which can be adduced without the necessity of any inference or presumption:\n\n1.1 Income tax\n\n1.1.1 Omission or understatement of taxable income \u2014\n\n1.1.1.1 Failure to file income tax return;\n\n1.1.1.2 Items of income and expenses, or assets or liabilities have been omitted, or falsely claimed in the accounting records or return in order to minimize or reduce taxes;\n\n1.1.1.3 Misclassification of accounts \u2014 Income taken up and classified as liabilities; erroneous classification of income from taxable to exempt; ordinary gains classified as capital gains; non-deductible expenses disguised as deductible items; and capital expenditures classified as deductible items.\n\n1.1.1.4 Sales/Income of domestic branches purportedly shown as income of the foreign head office;\n\n1.1.1.5 Keeping two sets of invoice or receipts \u2014 one set registered with the BIR and sales or income recorded thereon are the ones posted in the accounting records; whereas the other set is not reported for tax purposes.\n\n1.1.1.6 Keeping two sets of books of accounts/ records \u2014 one set registered with the BIR and the other set reflects the correct transactions and not registered and reported to the BIR.\n\n1.1.1.7 Non-issuance of receipts to customers; and\n\n1.1.1.8 Sales invoices or receipts issued to customers reflect the correct transactions, but invoices or receipts recorded for tax purposes reflect much smaller amounts.\n\n1.1.2 Utilization of other persons or entities \u2014\n\n1.1.2.1 Establishment of several entities \u2014 corporations, partnerships, or proprietorships, by a person making it appear that sales are made by the different entities created when in fact such sales are only made by one person;\n\n1.1.2.2 Allocating income and expenses to other persons in order to reduce or minimize taxes by a controlling person; and\n\n1.1.2.3 Establishment of a registered partnership or corporation, using dummy partners or stockholders.\n\n1.1.3 Improper claims of costs of sales and deductible expenses \u2014\n\n1.1.3.1 Fictitious purchases, or padding of purchases, or that proceeds are diverted to the personal benefit of the taxpayer or his assign.\n\n1.1.3.2 False or fictitious claims of deductions.\n\n1.1.3.3 Misclassification of deductions \u2014\n\nInvestments or major repairs or improvements claimed as nominal expenses;\n\n1.1.3.4 Dividend declarations classified as expenses or salaries.\n\n1.1.3.5 Withdrawals claimed as expenses or compensation.\n\n1.1.3.6 Claim of depreciation of non-existing assets or already fully depreciated, or on assets which were appraised higher for credit purposes.\n\n1.1.3.7 Claim of purchases from non-VAT sources as VAT purchases and claiming tax credits thereon; and\n\n1.1.3.8 Improper claims of tax credits without having paid the input taxes passed on by the seller.\n\n1.1.4 Claims of false personal exemption \u2014\n\nClaiming exemptions as married by an unmarried individuals or head of the family by single persons who do not actually support their parents; and\n\nClaiming false additional exemptions of alleged children, or children who are already of age or who are not physically incapacitated.\n\n1.2. Business Taxes \u2014 VAT and Percentage Taxes\n\n1.2.1 Omission or understatement of taxable sales/income \u2014\n\n1.2.1.1 Non-filing of VAT returns or Percentage Tax Returns;\n\n1.2.1.2 Keeping of falsified books of accounts;\n\n1.2.1.3 Non-issuance of sales invoices, or under-recording of sales or non-recording of true sales or income;\n\n1.2.1.4 Claiming fictitious tax credits;\n\n1.2.1.5 Crediting sales against items of expenses or costs of sales to conceal the amount of sales subject to business taxes on VAT;\n\n1.2.1.6 Deducting against sales or income discounts which were granted subsequently and not in the sales invoice;\n\n1.2.1.7 Deducting returned sales which were not actually returned.\n\n1.2.2 Misclassification of sales or income \u2014\n\n1.2.2.1 Classifying sales as exempt when in fact they are taxable;\n\n1.2.2.2 Misclassification of sales of goods subject to VAT as only subject to percentage taxes;\n\n1.2.2.3 Claiming domestic sales as export sales when in fact the goods were sold in the domestic market; and\n\n1.2.2.4 Sales in the local market which are made to appear as sales by the foreign head office.\n\n1.2.3 Claims of fictitious tax credits \u2014\n\n1.2.3.1 Claiming tax credits on purchases of goods from Non-VAT registered enterprises; and\n\n1.2.3.2 Claiming fictitious tax credits on non-existing invoices. CacHES\n\n1.2.4 Non-payment of VAT on materials imported for re-export \u2014\n\nMaterials were applied against goods originally imported for re-export, but which were used instead on goods sold in the local market.\n\n1.3. Estate Tax\n\n1.3.1 Failure to file estate tax return;\n\n1.3.2 Filing of estate tax returns on different jurisdictions to avoid payment of the higher graduated tax, as in the case where the deceased-owned properties in various places;\n\n1.3.3 Willful under-valuation of the market values of the properties of the estate;\n\n1.3.4 Willful omission of some properties especially those located in places other than the residence of the deceased; and\n\n1.3.5 Claim of fictitious items \u2014 funeral expenses, claims against the estate, judicial and testamentary expenses.\n\n1.4. Donor's Tax\n\n1.4.1 Failure to file donor's tax return;\n\n1.4.2 Filing of returns within the same year in various jurisdictions to evade the payment of the higher graduated tax;\n\n1.4.3 Willful omissions of prior donations made during the same taxable year;\n\n1.4.4 Willful undervaluation of the market value of the property donated; and\n\n1.4.5 Insufficient consideration on sales of property, the difference between the market value from the consideration agreed upon, considered as subject to the donor's tax.\n\n1.5 Excise Taxes\n\n1.5.1 Misclassification of articles subject to excise tax by making it appear that a particular manufactured article falls within a lower tax classification;\n\n1.5.2 Illegal manufacture of articles subject to excise tax;\n\n1.5.3 Unlawful possession or removal of articles subject to excise tax, and for which no tax has been paid;\n\n1.5.4 Unlawful use of denatured alcohol;\n\n1.5.5 Unlawful possession of cigarette paper in bobbins, etc. and\n\n1.5.6 Shipment or removal of liquor or tobacco products under false names or brands or as an imitation of any existing or otherwise known product name or brand.\n\n1.6. Documentary Stamps\n\nNon-affixture of the correct documentary stamps on pertinent documents or papers.\n\n1.7. Withholding Taxes\n\nFailure to withhold the correct taxes as withholding agent under the pertinent provisions of the Tax Code.\n\n2. Indirect Approach or by Indirect Method \u2014 This relies upon circumstantial evidence of determining the correct income or transaction of a taxpayer. Circumstantial evidence is that which tends to prove the existence of the disputed facts by proof of other facts which have a legitimate tendency to lead the mind to a conclusion that the fact exists which is sought to be established. However, where circumstantial evidence is relied upon to prove a fact, the circumstances must be proved by direct evidence and cannot themselves be inferred.\n\nThe legal bases for an indirect approach in the determination of the correct income or transactions of a taxpayer are anchored on Sections 16 and 37 of NIRC of 1988.\n\nPrincipal Types of Indirect Approach or Indirect Methods Used \u2014\n\n1. Net Worth Methods or Inventory Method or Net Worth & Expenditures Method\n\nThis is a method of reconstructing income based on the theory that if the taxpayer's net worth has increased in a given year in an amount larger than his reported income, he had understated his income for that year.\n\nFormula:\n\nThe mathematical formula for this method may be laid down as follows:\n\na. Increase in net worth, plus\n\nb. Non-deductible items, less\n\nc. Non-taxable income or receipts subjected to final tax or transfer taxes, equals\n\nd. Taxable net income, less\n\ne. Personal and additional exemptions equals\n\nf. Net income subject to tax\n\nThe Commissioner's determination of taxpayer's unreported income through the net worth expenditure method usually involves the following steps:\n\n(1) The net worth on a fixed starting date is established (excess of assets over liabilities). This starting date is usually the beginning of the first tax year under examination. The amount of such net worth is considered of vital importance in order to foreclose the possibility than an increase in net worth during the tax year, or an excess of expenditures over reported income, did not originate from prior accumulated funds (i.e. hoarded cash or undisclosed assets which would not represent income during the tax year);\n\n(2) The net worth at the close of each tax year under examination is established;\n\n(3) Comparison is made of the net worth at the beginning and end of each year, to determine the increase, if any;\n\n(4) The increase in net worth for each year is adjusted to eliminate items accounting for such increases which arise from non-taxable sources (i.e., gifts, bequests, other receipts exempt from tax, etc.) and adjustment is made where property is sold at a profit but the entire profit is not taxable because of long-term capital gain provisions. The increase in net worth for the year, after these eliminations and adjustments, is presumed to be income realized in that year;\n\n(5) The amount of non-deductible expenditures is determined or estimated. These items usually consist of personal, family and living expenses; and\n\n(6) The reconstructed income under the net worth expenditure method is the sum of items (4) and (5) and this amount is then compared with the income reported, if any, by the taxpayer.

Rev., L-17715, July 31, 1963).\n\nCircumstances and conditions necessary to warrant the use of the Indirect method in establishing a prima facie case of fraud:\n\n(1) That the taxpayer's accounting records are inadequate and do not clearly reflect his income; or that the taxpayer maintains no books and records; or that the taxpayer's accounting records are available, but he refuses to produce them;\n\n(2) That there is a fixed starting point or opening net worth, i.e., a date beginning of a taxable year or prior year to it, at which time the taxpayer's financial conditions can be affirmatively established with some definiteness; (Statements of net worth of taxpayers who availed of the tax amnesty under the provisions of Executive Order No. 41, may be used as the starting point as at December 31, 1985, pursuant to the authority given to the BIR under section 7 of said Executive Order);\n\n(3) That the circumstances are such that the method does reflect the taxpayer's income with reasonable accuracy and certainty, and proper and just additions of personal expenses and other non-deductible expenditures were made and correct; fair and equitable credit adjustments were given by way of eliminating non-taxable items or receipts or taxable income which have been subjected to final tax.\n\n(4) The need for evidence of the source of income under this method:\n\n\"In all leading cases on this matter, courts are unanimous in holding that when the tax case is civil in nature, direct proof of sources of income is not essential. . . . However, when a taxpayer is criminally prosecuted for tax evasion, the need for evidence of a likely source of income becomes a prerequisite for a successful prosecution. . . .\" RMC No. 43-74\n\nThis proof of a likely source of income may be shown by any of the following:\n\n(1) Demonstrating that there were specific omissions of income items by the taxpayer in his income tax return;\n\n(2) A showing that the nature of the taxpayer's business is such that it has the capacity of generating a substantial income;\n\n(3) Proofs of underdeclaration of income by the existence of unregistered sales invoices, which were not recorded in the books;\n\n(4) Findings of unrecorded purchases;\n\n(5) Existence of business permits, license from government agencies as to the types of businesses the taxpayer is engaged in;\n\n(6) Keeping separate sets of books \u2014 one registered and the other reflecting the correct transactions of a business;\n\n(7) Use of false invoices or documents; and\n\n(8) Willful destruction of accounting records.\n\n2. Expenditures Method or Excess Cash Expenditures Method:\n\nThe expenditures method proceeds on the theory that where the amount of money which a taxpayer spends during a given year exceeds his reported income, and the source of such money is otherwise unexplained, it may be inferred that such expenditures represent unreported income.\n\nThe discussions on when and how the net worth method should be used are equally applicable to the expenditures method. In a case where the taxpayer has several assets (and liabilities) whose cost bases remain the same throughout the period under investigation, the expenditures method may be preferred over the net worth method because a more laconic presentation can be made of the computation of taxable income. This is because assets and liabilities which do not change during the period under investigation may be omitted from the expenditures statement. The expenditures method is used often on a taxpayer who spends his income on lavish living and has little, if any, net worth. THcEaS\n\nFormula:\n\nThe expenditures method of determining income should be applied by deducting the aggregate yearly expenditures from the declared yearly income (Col. of Int. Rev. vs. Jamir, 4 SCRA 718, March 30, 1962).\n\nUnder this formula enunciated by the court in the above-cited case, the particulars in the use of this method are shown below:\n\nA. Expenditures for a given taxable year:\n\n(1) All expenses and deductions claimed per return filed with the BIR (Exclude non-cash items, such as amortization of goodwill, depreciation of assets, application of deferred expenses from prior period, etc.) Pxxx\n\n(2) Expenses, personal and non-deductible or deductible for tax purposes, as determined per investigation (Exclude non-cash items) xxx\n\n(3) Payments of debts, payables, accruals, and other liabilities \u2014 taken up in the ITR and those not taken up, such as personal and other liabilities xxx\n\n(4) Payment of taxes xxx\n\n(5) Acquisition of assets \u2014 per ITR and personal acquisitions such as cars, appliances, even real estate xxx\n\nTotal Expenditures per Investigation Pxxx\n\nB. Sources of Cash\n\n(1) Declared income per Income Tax Return Pxxx\n\nDeduct: Account Receivables if taxpayer is on cash basis method of accounting (xxx)\n\nAdd: Collections from receivables xxx\n\n(2) Non-taxable receipts, prizes, royalties, etc. xxx\n\n(3) Non-taxable receipts, such as dividends, donations from abroad xxx\n\n(4) Receipts subjected to transfer such as donations, inheritance xxx\n\n(5) Cash loans, if any xxx\n\n(6) Cash at the beginning of the period xxx xxx\n\n\u2014\u2014 \u2014\u2014\n\nExcess Cash as determined per Investigation Pxxx\n\nAs in the case of the Net Worth Method, when a tax case is civil in nature, direct proof of sources of income is not essential. However, when a criminal case is filed against the taxpayer, the need for evidence of a likely source of income becomes a prerequisite.\n\n3. Percentage Methods\n\nAlthough the use of this method is of little value in criminal cases, it is useful in test-checking or corroborating the results obtained by some other means of proof such as specific items, net worth, and expenditures methods, and for evaluating allegations from informants regarding unreported profits or income.\n\nThe percentage method is a computation whereby determinations are made by the use of percentages or ratios considered typical of the business under investigation. By reference to similar businesses or situations, percentage computations are secured to determine sales, gross profit, or even net profit. Likewise, by the use of some known base and the typical percentage applicable, individual items of income or expenses may be determined. ITScHa\n\nThese percentages may be externally derived or they may in some instances be internally derived from the taxpayers accounts for other periods or from an analysis of subsidiary records. Gross profit percentages may be determined by comparing purchase invoices with sales invoices, price list, and other similar data. Also other years not covered by the investigation or portion of years under investigation may indicate typical percentages applicable to the entire year or years under investigation.\n\nIt must, however, be emphasized that in comparing transactions of similarly situated businesses, the name of the particular taxpayer used as the model must not be divulged to the taxpayer under investigation nor in the report as this would constitute as a violation by an internal revenue officer of the provision of Section 269, NIRC of 1988 on unlawful divulgence of trade secrets.\n\n4. Unit and Value Method\n\nThis is not a prime method of proof. The determination or verification of gross receipts may be computed by applying price and profit figures to the known ascertainable quality of business done by the taxpayer.\n\nThis method is feasible when the investigation can ascertain the number of units handled by the taxpayer and also when he knows the price or profit charged per unit.\n\nThere may be regulatory body to which the taxpayer reports units of production or service.\n\nExamples are:\n\n(a) Records of sugar milled by a sugar central;\n\n(b) Records of fish production to the Bureau of Fishery and Aquatic Resources;\n\n(c) Records of production by pioneer and non-pioneer industries to the Board of Investments; and\n\n(d) Records of logs exported to the Forest Management Bureau.\n\nD. SOURCES OF FRAUD CASES\n\n1. From routine examination of returns:\n\na. Keeping no records or inadequate records despite substantial transactions reflected in the returns;\n\nb. Standard of living of the taxpayer, such as the possession of expensive cars and jewelry, or staying in a luxurious mansion, and ownership of properties whose values far exceed his probable sources of income as declared per return.\n\nc. Records, verified, were not properly declared for tax purposes;\n\nd. False vouchers and receipts which were verified in the course of the routine examination.\n\n2. From information furnished by:\n\na. An informant who has knowledge of the transactions of the taxpayers which were not properly declared for tax purposes;\n\nb. Referrals from other government offices or from other investigating units of the BIR.\n\n3. Through the initiative of the investigating officers:\n\na. From newspaper reports;\n\nb. Through research of available government records such as from offices of the Register of Deeds, Bureau of Highways, and other government offices; and\n\nc. In relation to an investigation of another taxpayer, where he suspects certain transactions were not declared for tax purposes.\n\nE. INDICATIONS OF FRAUD\n\n1.

PROCESSING OF A TAX FRAUD CASE\n\n1. Preliminary Investigation:\n\nThe purpose of preliminary investigation is to establish the existence of a prima facie indications of fraud. To gather evidences therefor the courses of action that may be conducted pursuant to the pertinent Tax Code provision, are but not limited to the following:\n\na. Sec. 7 Access to records of private persons or entities,\n\nand government offices and agencies; and\n\nInterview potential witnesses.\n\nb.

Preparation of a preliminary investigation report with a recommendation for the Issuance of a Letter of Authority:\n\nThe examiner or revenue official who discovers a potential tax fraud case must submit a memorandum report to his immediate superior stating the facts and circumstances which constitute the indication of fraud, and the evidence at hand to be verified and confirmed.\n\nThe issuances and approvals of Letters of Authority for fraud cases shall be in accordance with existing rules and regulations on such issuances. The issuance of Letters of Authority, in the case of the Tax Fraud Division, may be dispensed with when so warranted by the circumstance of the case; provided that the taxpayer shall be notified by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue that his internal revenue tax liabilities are under investigation or that the report thereon has been submitted.\n\n3. Formal Fraud Investigation:\n\n(a) Whenever there appears to be a need for a formal tax fraud investigation of a particular taxpayer, a work plan must be prepared in accordance with the following guidelines:\n\n(1) Review all available information;\n\n(2) Determine the objectives of the investigation;\n\n(a) Development of criminal tax case;\n\n(b) Deciding the particular provision of the NIRC allegedly violated and asking by whom, when, where, and by what means. Were Revenue Regulations, Revenue Memorandum Circulars or BIR Rulings and issuances also violated or involved;\n\n(c) Understanding clearly the elements of the offense.\n\n(3) If it is an investigation referred by an informant, recontact and obtain detailed information about the origin of the case, who has been talked to, what was said, available records, etc. Re-interview the person who initially provided the information or made the allegation.\n\n(4) Determine the following:\n\n(a) Information that is needed;\n\n(b) Relative importance of the desired information;\n\n(c) Best sources of information; and\n\n(d) Best sequence for making the necessary inquiries.\n\n(5) Gather background information:\n\n(a) Obtain as much information as possible on the suspect;\n\n(b) Obtain tax returns from Revenue District Offices concerned;\n\n(c) Obtain pertinent records such as General Information Sheet, Articles of Incorporation, Constitution and By-Laws, Financial Statements from Securities and Exchange Commission and other information from Bureau of Domestic Trade, Department of Trade and Industry and other government agencies.\n\n(6) In conclusion, decide if an examination of the taxpayer's books of accounts is warranted and the best method of proof.\n\nG. PREPARATION AND ASSEMBLY OF REPORTS FOR TAX FRAUD CASES\n\n(1) Planning the report:\n\nBefore starting to write a report, the examiner should have in mind a definite outline of the arrangement in which the facts and evidence may be presented in the most effective manner. A good general plan is to state the problem, present the results of the investigation, and set forth the conclusions and recommendations.\n\n(2) Assembly of a report:\n\nA report should be assembled in the following manner:\n\n(a) Table of Contents\n\nThe table of contents should indicate the subject matter, and page number in the docket, to provide quick reference to important features of the case.\n\n(b) Body of the Report\n\nThe format of the report must more or less contain the following information and presentation whenever it is necessary:\n\nb-1 Name and Address of Taxpayer\n\nb-2 Tax periods involved in the investigation\n\nb-3 Returns filed and statute of limitations\n\nb-4 Type of violation \u2014 indicate the pertinent provision of the Tax Code violated\n\nb-5 Origin of the case\n\nb-6 Name and Titles of cooperating BIR officers\n\nb-7 Letter of Authority number, date issued, issuing officer\n\nb-8 Date the taxpayer was first contacted by the examiners\n\nb-9 Representative of the taxpayer\n\nb-10 Brief description of the method used in the evasion or other violation\n\nb-11 Related cases\n\nb-12 Summary of facts determined during the investigation\n\nExplanations on the evidence in support of the tax deficiency\n\nExplanations on the evidence in support of the criminal aspect\n\nb-13 Explanation and defense of taxpayer\n\nb-14 Conclusions and recommendations\n\nThe body of the report should contain a reference to the appendices or worksheets and schedules, the appendices should contain a reference to exhibits which consist of supporting documents. For example: \"Appendix A is a summary of the unreported receipts from sales, and Exhibits 8 to 25 are copies of documents in support thereof.\" Important matters in the exhibits generally should be explained in the report. However, if a document is of the nature that it is adequately described in an appendix, no further explanation is necessary. When mentioning or referring to a document that is submitted as an exhibit, including the written statement of a witness, insert the exhibit number in parenthesis immediately following the reference. ADaECI\n\nThe examiner, before beginning his report, should arrange the proposed appendices and exhibits in the order of his planned presentation of facts and evidence, and then he prepares his report discussing the appendices and exhibits in that order. When the report is completed, the exhibits should be assembled in the order in which they are originally mentioned in the report, and they should be numbered for easy reference.",

RATIONALE\n\nWhereas Revenue Audit Memorandum Order (RAMO) No. 1-86 dated April 25, 1986 imposes income tax on the gross income generated from constructive trading and commission income derived from brokering activities of Philippines branches of MNEs engaged in trading activities.\n\nWhereas RAMO No. 1-86 makes no recognition of such factors as the nature of item traded, the risk involved and participation of the local branch;\n\nWhereas the implementation of RAMO No. 1-86 makes use of much approximations and estimates;\n\nTherefore, this Order is issued to revise RAMO No. 1-86 and to cover taxation of Philippine branches and liaison offices of MNEs engaged in soliciting orders, purchases, services contracts, trading, construction and other activities.\n\nWith this Order, taxation of Philippine branches and liaison offices of MNEs engaged in soliciting orders, purchases, service contracts, trading, constructions and other activities becomes more practical, easy and equitable. At the same time, this Order addresses taxation of construction and other activities by the same Philippine branches and liaison offices of MNEs as separate undertakings.\n\nII. OBJECTIVES\n\nThis Order is issued to:\n\na) Amend and supersede RAMO No. 1-86 dated April 25, 1986 which provides for the procedures for tax audit of Philippine branches or foreign corporation.\n\nb) Address the issue on the proper determination of the income tax liability of Philippine branches and liaison offices of MNEs pursuant to Section 43 of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC)wherein the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) is authorized to distribute, apportion or allocate gross income or deduction among organizations in order to clearly reflect the income of any such organization.\n\nc) Provide guidelines on implementation of policies on the proper determination of the income tax liability of Philippine branches and liaison offices of MNEs.\n\nd) Prescribed the minimum procedure required in the audit of the income tax liability of Philippine branches and liaison offices of MNEs.\n\nIII. COVERAGE\n\na) This Order shall pay only to Philippine branches and liaison of Japanese trading firms which are members of the Sogo Shoshas and registered with the Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry (JCCI), and also all other foreign trading companies similarly situated as determined by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue.\n\nb) Furthermore, the content of this Order will apply only to income tax liabilities of Philippine branches and liaison offices of MNEs and will not affect the withholding, including branch profit remittance, and business tax obligations of the same Philippine branches and liaison offices of MNEs which shall be subject to the provisions of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC).\n\nIV. GUIDELINES\n\n1. The Philippine income tax due from soliciting orders, purchaser, service contracts, trading, construction and other activities of the Philippine branches and liaison offices of MNEs will be ascertained using the following formula.\n\nFor solicitation and trading activities\n\n{(Worldwide Operating Sales to the Philippines attribution tax)}\n\n{( Income X Worldwide Sales X rate X rate )}\n\nFor construction and other activities\n\nplus {(Net Income from construction and other activities X tax rate )}\n\n2. In implementing the above formula, the following terms shall be construed to mean as follows:\n\n(a) Worldwide (W/W) shall include head office accounts and those of branches located in difference countries but shall exclude subsidiary accounts.\n\n(b) W/W Operating Income shall include the Gross Income minus Selling General & Administrative expenses. Operating Income does not include non-operating and extraordinary items like interest expense, exchange profit/loss capital gains/losses or other income/loss not related not related to operation.\n\n(c) Sales to the Philippines shall be defined as the aggregated amount of exports and offshore transactions to the Philippines by the Head Office, all branches and liaison offices and shall include the amount of indent transactions from which commissions are generated. These shall also include imported materials and equipment of construction projects undertaken in the Philippines, but shall exclude local service income from construction projects or onshore income from local construction.\n\n(d) W/W Sales shall consist of domestic, export, import and offshore transactions which include nor only principal transactions but also indent transactions from which commissions are generated.\n\n(e) Attribution rate shall mean a rate of 75% to be applied against formula.\n\n(f) The tax rate to be applied shall be in accordance with Section 25(a) of the NIRC which is 35%.\n\n(g) Net income on construction shall consist of local service income from construction projects income from construction projects less the costs associated with local construction projects including the cost of locally purchased materials equipment, if any.\n\n(h) Net income on all other activities shall consist of income such as branches and liaison offices of MNEs are engaged in, net of costs and expenses associated with such income.\n\n3. In the application of the formula, no offsetting of losses from one line of business to the detriment of the other line of business shall be allowed. This would mean that the tax due from each line of business shall be computed independently from the other line of business.\n\nV. PROCEDURES\n\n1.

Verify correctness of Worldwide Operating Income and the Worldwide Sales figures against the financial statements obtained in 4 above.\n\n6. Request for a summary of Sales to the Philippines duly certified by an independent public accountant and authenticated by the Philippine Embassy or Consulate situated within the country where the Home Office of the MNE is located. The Sales to the Philippine shall include the offshore portion of the local construction projects which includes the supply of machinery and equipment.\n\n7. Request for presentation of copies of pertinent sales invoices, bills of lading, freight and insurance coverages and other documents to verify Sales to the Philippines, on a test sampling basis.\n\nFor construction activities\n\n8. Review all Contracts and analyze the nature of the Contracts, the parties involved, the terms and conditions, the total contract price, the payment and other pertinent information.\n\n9. Determine method of accounting, whether completed contract or the percentage of completion, and check the correctness of take up in the books of accounts.\n\n10. Segregate the income from exempt transactions from that of taxable transactions, if applicable.\n\n11. Determine the total contract price and composition of the project. The total contract price includes:\n\n12. Verify that only the supply of local/civil works (onshore portion) is included in computation of profit/loss on local construction project.\n\n13. Determine if costs and expenses corresponded only to the service portion of the project referred to in 11 above.\n\n14.

                                    "Details": "I. SCOPE:\n\nThis order prescribes the guidelines for the processing and issuance of tax credit certificates (TCC) on value-added tax (VAT) credit claims of zero-rated taxpayers. cd i\n\nII. ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES:\n\n1. That this RAMO shall exclusively be applicable to VAT claims for TCC of direct exporters on their purchases of goods and services filed at the One-Stop-Shop (Center-DOF). Claims for VAT refund shall be filed and processed at the BIR National Office under RAMO No. 1-91.\n\n2. That claims processed under this RAMO shall not require a Letter of Authority (LA) from the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR). However, claimants/taxpayers can still be subjected to the regular audit of its other business tax liabilities (non-VAT transactions) by the Revenue District Offices or any audit office authorized by the CIR.\n\n3. That any outstanding delinquent account shall first be settled by the claimant before the TCC shall be issued either by agreeing to the issuance of a separate TCC that may be used only to pay the said account or by paying in cash. Under the former, the fact that it shall be used only for the payment of the delinquent account shall be indicated on the face of the TCC. Another TCC shall be issued for the excess of the approved claim over the delinquent account.\n\nWhere the delinquent account has been protested, the claim for TCC may be given due course provided that the protest has been filed in accordance with Revenue Regulations No. 12-85. Such fact shall be certified by the Chief, Accounts Receivable/Billing Division not later than 5 days from date of referral.\n\n4. That any findings on deficiency internal revenue taxes shall be referred to the concerned audit office.\n\n5. That the TCC may be used by the grantee in payment of its direct internal revenue tax liabilities as provided in Revenue Memorandum Order No. 20-91 dated June 10, 1991. cdt\n\n6. That the filing and processing of VAT credit application shall be on a quarterly basis and the 60- working day period for processing of claims shall start on the day of submission of the last documents specified in the checklist of requirements (Annex A).\n\nIII. AUDIT PROCEDURES:\n\nA. Checklisting:\n\nUpon receipt of the claim, an evaluator shall have a maximum of 5 working days to ascertain the completeness of the application and to ensure that the claim is filed within the prescribed period. The day of filing shall be the reckoning date for the purpose of stopping the prescription of the right to the tax credit. If the supporting documents are incomplete and/or not in order (e.g., invoices not arranged in accordance with schedules submitted), the claimant will be advised to fully comply with the requirements:\n\nB. Pre-Audit Steps:\n\n1. Review and familiarize with:\n\na) the business organization of the taxpayer, and whether it has business establishments other than its main or head office;\n\nb) the economic activity and the applicable provisions of the laws and regulations governing such activity;\n\nc) the accounting methods and policies, and degree of internal control; and\n\nd) report of the audit of value-added tax credit/claim liabilities of the taxpayer for the immediately preceding period in order that were reported.\n\n2. Determine if the claim was filed within two (2) years (Sec. 106, NIRC)\n\n(a) in the case of export sales, within 2 years from the date of exportation;\n\n(b) in the case of importation or local purchase of capital goods, within 2 years after the expiration of 2 succeeding quarters following the quarter in which the importation or local purchase was made; however, in the case of a VAT registered person who is just commencing business, the application must be within two years after the lapse of 180 days from the date of Registration or actual start of business operations, whichever comes later;\n\n(c) in the case of other zero-rated transactions, within 2 years after the close of the quarter when the transaction was made. cda\n\nC. Audit of Sales and Output Tax:\n\n1. Determination of gross taxable sale of goods and services\n\na) Review and reconcile the amount of each category of sales per VAT return with the recorded amount of sales in the general ledger and subsidiary sales journal prescribed under RR 5-87. In case of VAT refund/tax credit, reconcile sales with the reported zero-rated sales per application under BIR Form 2552. Any discrepancy should be properly accounted for and evaluated for possible value-added tax (output tax) deficiency. Ascertain that:\n\na.1 Only those transactions which are specifically exempted under Section 103 of NIRC are treated as exempt sales.\n\na.2 \"Deemed\" sales of goods are recorded as taxable transactions (Sec. 100(b), NIRC and Sec. 4, RR 5-87\n\na.2.1 Transfer, use, or consumption not in the course of business of goods originally intended for sale or for use in the course of business. Transfer of goods not in the course of business can take place when the VAT-registered person withdraws goods from his business for personal use;\n\na.2.2 Distribution or transfer to shareholders or investors as share in the profits of the business;\n\na.2.3 Transfer to creditors in payment of debt or obligation;\n\na.2.4 Consigned goods not actually sold after 60 days from date of consignment are considered deemed sold. Consigned goods returned by the consignee within the 60-day period are considered not deemed sold; and\n\na.2.5 Retirement from or cessation of business or death of an individual with respect to inventories of all goods on hand, whether capital goods, stock-in-trade, supplies or materials as of date of such retirement or cessation, whether or not the business is continued by the new owner or successor, estate or heir. The following circumstances shall, among others, give rise to transactions \"deemed sale\":\n\n1. change of ownership of business in the case of a single proprietorship;\n\n2. dissolution of a partnership and creation of a new partnership which takes over the business; and\n\n3. death of an individual who is a VAT-registered person, even if the estate or heirs of the decedent shall continue to operate the business.\n\na.3 Sales declared as zero-rated actually emanate from export sales, foreign currency denominated sales, and other transactions that may qualify as zero-rated sales (Sec. 100 (a) (1) and (2); Sec. 102 (a) (1), (2) and (3), NIRC and Sec. 8, RR 5-87).\n\na.3.1 For direct export sales, examine sales agreement with foreign buyers as to the nature of products to be exported, pricing and other terms and conditions. Review export documents such as commercial invoices/receipts, bills of lading or airway bills, export declarations/permits, packing lists, etc., and ascertain that the proceeds of the sale had been actually inwardly remitted. This will require a liquidation statement from the Central Bank (CB) or any of its accredited agent banks certifying as to the amount of the export proceeds or consideration, the date of inward remittance, conversion rate and the total peso value thereof (RMO 23-88). Prepare and submit Schedule I with the following information: aisa dc\n\nSCHEDULE I\n\na.3.2 For foreign currency denominated sales, review the transactions and ascertain the following:\n\ni The buyers are Filipinos residing abroad, returning overseas workers or other non-residents;\n\nii The objects of sale are goods for household or personal use assembled or manufactured in the Philippines and delivered to residents of the Philippines;\n\niii The goods are paid for in convertible foreign currency inwardly remitted through the banking system. This requirement may be evidenced by a statement from the Central Bank or its accredited bank; and\n\niv The sales do not exceed an aggregate value of US $1,000 or its equivalent per transaction.\n\na.3.3 For zero-rated sale of services, verify contract agreement to ascertain the person for whom the services were rendered, amount of consideration, description of the services, and documents evidencing actual payments. Determine if proceeds of sale in foreign currency (Paragraphs 1 and 2 of Section 102, NIRC) had been inwardly remitted in accordance with CB rules and regulations. Prepare and submit Schedule II with the following information:\n\nSCHEDULE II\n\na.3.4 In case of constructive inward remittance, the claimant shall also submit the following:\n\n1. Central Bank approval of offsetting arrangement.\n\n2. Certification from the Central Bank on the amount constructively remitted under the off-setting arrangement.\n\nShould the amount of inward remittance be less than the total zero-rated sales, the input tax pertaining to the discrepancy shall be removed from the allowable input tax using the following formula:\n\na.3.5 For effectively zero-rated transactions, secure copy of the approved application for zero- rating. Take note of the effectivity and revocation date of the zero-rated transaction. Transactions effected before the effectivity date as indicated in the approved application are subject to VAT (RR 2-88). cdtai\n\nb) Analyze all accounts affecting total sales, particularly cash account, accounts and/or notes receivable, collections from receivables, sales discounts, and sales returns, bad debts written off, etc.\n\nIn the case of sale of service, include in the analysis other accounts such as advances, retention receivables, mobilization fees, etc.\n\nb.1 Apply the following pro-forma computation to arrive at the total sale of goods.\n\nb.2 Account for the quantity of goods actually sold, in appropriate cases, as a tool to further audit \u2014\n\nb.3 Determine the taxable sale by applying the following computation:\n\nb.4 Apply the following pro-forma computation to arrive at the gross receipts during the period:\n\nb.5 In applying the foregoing computations, except c.2, all the accounts should be net of VAT.\n\n2. Audit checks to detect irregularities in invoicing and accounting for sales transactions.\n\na) Ensure that the sales invoices issued for sales transactions are all accounted for. Account for any break in the sequence of serial numbers of sales invoices and official receipts issued, and invoices assigned to branches. In case of cancelled sales invoice, the original copy should be on file. For those using loose-leaf invoices, require presentation of authority to use the same.\n\nb) Check if the amounts indicated in the sales invoices were properly recorded in the books of accounts. cd\n\nc) Determination of compliance with invoicing requirements and procedures.\n\nc.1 Ascertain that invoices bear all necessary information including the VAT/Taxpayer's Identification Number (Secs. 108(a) and 238, NIRC).\n\nc.2 For the verification of the VAT liabilities for the first quarter/semester of 1988, secure inventory list of unused sales invoices as of December 31, 1987 as prescribed under RMC 51-87 and verify authority to print subsequent receipts/invoices. Ensure that the sales invoices issued for sales transactions are all accounted for.\n\nc.3 Check authority to use cash register machines and verify whether each and every cash register machine in use is duly authorized.\n\nc.4 Be alert on the use of double or multiple set of invoices bearing identical serial numbers.\n\nc.5 Verify if the transactions covered by \"Statement of Account,\" \"Delivery Receipt,\" \"Debit Notes,\" and other similar documents are properly recorded as sales. The mere issuance of these documents without the corresponding sales invoice is a violation of the bookkeeping regulations and an indication of unrecorded sales except in the case of bona fide consignment sales.\n\nWhen confronted with a delivery receipt, ascertain whether it covers a consummated sale or consignment sale. Consignment sale shall be considered as taxable sale after sixty (60) days following the date of consignment (Sec. 4(D), RR 5-87).\n\nc.6 If the taxpayer is engaged in both taxable and exempt transactions, ascertain that only VAT invoices are issued for VAT taxable transactions and separate invoices are issued for exempt transactions (Sec. 21, RR 5-87). Exempt transactions for which VAT invoices are issued shall be considered subject to VAT.\n\nc.7 In the case of zero-rated transactions to BOI-export-oriented enterprises or other entities whose purchases are effectively zero-rated or exempted under special laws or international agreement, check if the words \"ZERO-RATED\" or \"EXEMPT\" had been prominently stamped or printed on the face of the sales invoice (Sec. 2(a)(3), RR 2-88). If not, the transactions should be considered taxable.\n\nd) Ascertainment of the correctness of output tax computation by taking the following steps:\n\nd.1 Verify whether other charges such as excise taxes, packaging, insurance, freight and delivery expenses, etc., are treated as part of the gross taxable sales.\n\nd.2 Check the output tax by multiplying the total amount (inclusive of the amount intended by the seller to cover the tax or the tax billed erroneously) by 1/11 or such other factor applicable to persons partially exempt under special laws to determine the correct output tax (Sec. 6(a) and (b), RR 5-87).\n\nd.3 Determine if the taxpayer enjoys full or partial exemption from payment of the value-added tax pursuant to special laws, and verify the extent of exemption and compliance with the condition of such exemptions. Compute the amount of output tax by applying the corresponding factor applicable to the level of exemption:\n\nd.4 Account for deductions from sales such as sales returns, allowances and discounts. Sales returns and allowances may be deducted from the gross taxable sale if they have been previously recorded and are properly supported by credit memos. Discounts, on the other hand, can only be taken into account if indicated on the face of the invoice at the time of sale. (Sec. 100 (d) (3), NIRC).\n\ne) In the case of gross taxable sales of services (GTSS), advance payment or downpayment or deposits, as well as the cost of materials supplied with the services shall form part of the GTSS. If it is claimed that the material component of the contract price is for the account of the customer of contractee, verify the terms of the contract to ascertain who actually made the purchase and in whose name the transaction was invoiced.\n\nf) Identify instances of gross selling prices of goods and services being unreasonably lower than the actual market price, and make the necessary adjustments (Sec. 6(a), RR 5-87). cda\n\ng) For VAT taxpayer claiming the privilege of paying the 4% contractor's tax after December 31, 1987, verify his compliance with the following conditions:\n\ng.1 Filing of information return showing the contractor's name, the outstanding contract price as of December 31, 1987, and a declaration to pay the contractor's tax due;\n\ng.2 Copy of the contractor's billing issued prior to January 1, 1988 must be attached to the information return;\n\ng.3 Ascertain the recording of the outstanding contract price receivable (on contracts completed and billed as of December 31, 1987) on the taxpayer's books of accounts; and\n\ng.4 Filing of the contractor's tax return on or before January 20, 1988 or the 20th day of the month following the end of each calendar quarter.\n\nNon-compliance with any of the above conditions subjects the amount received to 10% VAT (Sec. 6(g), RR 5-87).\n\nh) Be resourceful in discovering underdeclaration of sales. Abnormal levels of inventories, sales, purchases, accounts receivables, including manipulation of interbranch transactions, among others, etc., may suggest instances of underdeclaration. Cross-check transactions reflected in the books of accounts against the records of selected customers and suppliers.\n\nD. Audit of Purchases and Input Tax\n\n1. Reconcile the amount of each category of purchases per VAT return with the amount of purchases per subsidiary purchase journal (Sec. 22(b), RR 5-87). Check if all the information required are maintained in the purchase journal.\n\n2. Review the composition of the purchase accounts in the journals and ledgers and ascertain that:\n\n2.1 Purchases from non-VAT and/or exempt persons do not result in any input tax credit;\n\n2.2 Effectively zero-rated purchases do not result in any input tax credit;\n\n2.3 Purchases from VAT persons, which are personal in nature, shall not give rise to input tax credit; and\n\n2.4 Deemed-paid input tax credits (for purchases from BOI-registered pioneer enterprises) have been determined correctly in accordance with Sec. 13(4), RR 5-87.\n\n3. Scrutinize the entries appearing in the subsidiary purchase journal and compare with information shown on the purchase invoice.\n\n4. Determine substantiation of claims for input tax credits:\n\n4.1 For domestic purchases of goods (including capital goods) and services in the course of business, these must be supported by VAT invoices or receipts showing the information required in Sec. 108 (a), 238 and 239 of the NIRC. A cash register machine tape, although it indicates the VAT registration/taxpayer identification number of the seller, does not constitute valid proof of input tax credit (Sec. 15(a), RR 5-87). The same condition will apply for delivery receipts or statements of accounts issued by the seller. aisa dc\n\n4.2 Credit for input tax on importations shall be supported by official receipts issued by the Bureau of Customs, import entry declarations or equivalent documents showing actual payment of VAT on imported goods (Sec. 15(b), RR 5-87). Therefore, withdrawals of raw materials or other goods from customs bonded warehouses without the payment of VAT are not entitled to input tax credits.\n\n4.3 VAT invoices issued for exempt and zero-rated transactions will not generate input tax credits to the purchaser.\n\n5. Determine correctness of claims for input tax credits through the following procedures:\n\n5.1 Check the correctness of input tax credits by multiplying the total invoice amount by the applicable factor (Sec. 13, RR 5-87).\n\n5.2 If the taxpayer enjoys exemptions on its sales of goods or services under special laws, he is only entitled to input tax credits equivalent to his level of taxability.\n\nFor example:\n\nX, a BOI-registered pioneer enterprise, enjoys a 10% tax exemption for the taxable year under investigation. During the same year, his sales amounted to P1,000,000 and the input tax on his purchases amounted to P50,000. The creditable input tax shall be computed as follows:\n\n5.3 Check the authenticity of substantial claims of input tax credits by confirming purchase transactions through, but not limited to:\n\na. access to supplier's records;\n\nb. comparing purchases of other taxpayers belonging to the same industry; and\n\nc. cross-checking the amount of purchases with the amount reflected in the Summary List of Purchases as prescribed under RR 6-89.\n\n6.  Make sure that the input tax credit available is correspondingly reduced by the full amount applied for refund/TCC filed with the BIR, BOI, Bureau of Customs and other government agencies, whether granted or not, in the quarter when the application was filed. cd\n\n7. Allocate the input tax creditable as follows:\n\nIf a VAT-registered person is also engaged in exempt activities, the input taxes paid for purchase of goods (including capital goods) and services which cannot be attributed to either operation shall be allocated between the VAT taxable operation and the non-VAT operation using the computation prescribed in Sec. 12 of RR 5-87. The amount allocated to the exempt transaction should reduce the input tax credit balance.\n\nFor instance:\n\n8. Reconcile the amounts of input tax claimed in the VAT return for the portion carried over from previous quarters and the balance carried to succeeding quarters with the amounts recorded in the books of accounts.\n\n9. Exclude the following in computing the refundable/creditable input taxes: cdtai\n\na. Transitory input tax;\n\nb. Deemed-paid input tax; and\n\nc. Deferred input tax on ending inventory as introduced under Step 2, Sec. 3 of RR 9-89.\n\n10. Secure certification of amount on input taxes deferred under RR 9-89 from the head of the investigating unit which handled the processing of the immediately preceding and succeeding claims to determine the correct amount of input taxes to be added to the current claim.\n\nE. Reporting Requirements:\n\nThe Evaluation/Audit Report is contained in a prescribed form (Annex B) which must be fully accomplished and accompanied by the following:\n\n1. Authority to Issue VAT Credit Form (Annex C)\n\n2. Letter to Bureau of Customs authorizing the said office to issue the corresponding tax credit certificate on the input taxes arising from importation (Annex D), in proper cases\n\n3. Checklist of Audit Procedure Undertaken in the Audit of VAT Credit (Annex E)\n\n4. Delinquency Verification Form duly certified by the Chief, Accounts Receivable/Billing Division\n\n5. BIR Form No. 2552. Application for VAT credit\n\n6. Photocopies of BIR Form no. 2550-VAT Returns\n\n7. Audit Working Papers\n\n7.1 Sales and Output Tax\n\n7.2 Forex Receipts\n\n7.3 Purchase and Input taxes, including disallowances\n\n7.4 Analysis of relevant accounts such as cash, receivables, payables, purchases, input tax, etc.\n\n8. Agreement Form, in proper cases\n\n9. Other documents required from the claimant enumerated in the checklist of requirements (Annex A)\n\nF. Cancellation of Original Purchase documents:\n\nUpon the final approval of the claim, but before the preparation of the tax credit certificate or disbursement voucher for refunds, the sources of allowed or disallowed input tax credits such as the original purchase invoices and official receipts shall be cancelled with the words \"cancelled\" stamped on the invoice or official receipt. The cancellation shall also be initialed by the cancelling officer. casia\n\nStrict compliance herewith is enjoined.\n\nLIWAYWAY VINZONS-CHATO\nCommissioner of Internal Revenue",

                                    "Details": "1. Scope:\n\nThis order shall govern the verification of cases involving the disposition of shares of stocks issued by a domestic corporation wherein the tax exemption of the resulting capital gains is being invoked by the taxpayer pursuant to the provision of the Philippine tax treaties.\n\n2. Background information\n\nThere is a general pattern of transactions undertaken by taxpayers wherein the corresponding income tax is not being paid or is substantially reduced for the disposition of shares of stocks issued by a domestic corporation. The common features characterizing these are as follows:\n\n1. There is an initial transfer or disposition of the shares of stocks by the first transferor to a resident of a treaty country. This transfer can either be in the form of tax free or deferred exchange pursuant to Section 34 of the Tax Code, or property dividend distribution, or donation, or sale, or any other mode of transfer.\n\n2. The transfer price involved in this first transfer (hereinafter called as the \"initial transfer price\") is relatively low when compared to the subsequent transfer as described in the following three sentences.\n\n3. There is subsequent transfer by the new owner of the shares of stock (the resident of the treaty country and hereinafter called as the \"subsequent transferor\") cdasia\n\n4. This subsequent transfer occurs within a relatively short period of time following the initial transfer.\n\n5. The transfer price involved in this subsequent transfer (hereinafter called as the \"subsequent transfer price\") is relatively higher in value when compared to the initial transfer price.\n\n6. The first transferor and the subsequent transferor are directly or indirectly interrelated.\n\n7. The exemption from payment of tax in the Philippines for the resulting capital gains in the subsequent transfer is being invoked pursuant to the Philippine tax treaty provision which generally provides that only the country of residence of transferor or alienator can tax such gain.\n\nAs a result of these series of transactions between the interrelated parties, minimal taxes (if any) are paid to the Philippines for these transfers of shares of stocks issued by a domestic corporation. It is to be noted that in the absence of the particular tax treaty provision, the gain arising from these series of transfers are generally taxable pursuant to Sections 21 to 22, 24, to 25, and 36 of the Tax Code.\n\n3. Audit procedures\n\nIn order to prevent the abuse of the tax exemption provision of the Philippine tax treaties pertaining to capital gains of sale of shares of stocks, the following audit procedures are prescribed: cda\n\n3.1 Ascertain if the elements described in part 2 above are present in the series of transactions involving the disposition of shares of stocks. The important factors to consider are the relationship between the first transferor and the transferee (resident of the treaty country), the time gap between first and subsequent transfer, etc.\n\n3.2 Request for the pertinent documents prescribed in Revenue Memorandum Order No. 10-92, pertaining to the revised procedures for tax treaty relief applications and processing thereof.\n\n3.3 Evaluate if the pertinent elements in the series of transactions are arms length or reasonable in nature. Indicators hereof include the following:\n\n3.3.1 As to the time gap between the series of transfers - there is reasonable justification to allow the transactions if the subsequent transfer is effected not less than six (6) months from the date of the initial transfer.\n\n3.3.2 As to disparity in transfer prices between the series of transfer - there is reasonable justification to consider such transfer prices as being arms length if these approximate the fair market valuation standard, as measured by the appreciation of the subsequent transfer over the initial price, such that the subsequent transfer price appreciates by not more than three (3) percent for each month the shares of stocks are held by the subsequent transferor prior to his disposition.\n\nIn the absence of any of these conditions, there is a prima facie presumption that the transactions between the first transferor and the subsequent transferor are not arms length or reasonable in nature.\n\n3.4 Allocate income and/or the transfer price between the first transferor and the subsequent transferor if there are indications that the initial transfer price is below the arms length price. Pursuant to Section 43 of the Tax Code, the allocation of such income/transfer prices is allowable in order to clearly reflect the income of interrelated taxpayers. In this circumstance, the subsequent transfer price can be considered as the arms length price to consider for the first transfer. casia\n\n3.5 Determine the deficiency taxes that will be payable by the first transferor.\n\n4. Illustration\n\nThis example explains the application of the transactions and procedures discussed earlier.\n\nFACTS. Domestic Corporation A sold its investments in Domestic Corporation B to Foreign Corporation C for P1 million in August 1, 1992, deriving a gain of P100,000 from such sale, considering that these investment's original cost were P900.00. One month later, Foreign Corporation C sold the same shares of stocks for P5 million.\n\nForeign Corporation C is related to Domestic Corporation A is a resident of a country which has a treaty with the Philippines. This treaty provides that capital gains from sale of shares of stocks are taxable only in the country of residence of the alienator.\n\nTAX TREATMENT OF PARTIES CONCERNED. Domestic Corporation A paid capital gains tax of P10,000 for the first transfer. Foreign Corporation C is exempt from payment of any taxes to the Philippines pursuant to the tax treaty provisions.\n\nEVALUATION. The elements discussed in the earlier paragraphs are present in this case. These include the following:\n\na. Domestic Corporation A and Foreign Corporation C are interrelated.\n\nb. The initial transfer price is artificially low, resulting in the minimum amount of taxes being paid by Domestic Corporation A.\n\nc. The subsequent transfer price is relatively high compared to the initial transfer price. cdtai\n\nd. The second transfer occurred within a relatively short time after the first transfer.\n\ne. Pursuant to the existing tax treaty, the subsequent transferor or Foreign Corporation C is exempt from payment of tax to the Philippines.\n\nGiven these circumstances, Section 43 of the Tax Code can be used as the basis for determining this deficiency tax against Domestic Corporation A as follows:\n\n5. Effectivity\n\nThis Order shall take effect immediately.\n\n(SGD.) JOSE U. ONG\nCommissioner of Internal Revenue",

                                    "Details": "The following guidelines shall govern the audit of income tax returns of non-resident citizens. The International Tax Affairs Division and all Assessment Branches in the regional offices, in line with the delegation of the audit of these returns pursuant to RMO No. 10-91, will adopt these procedures and forms in the discharge of the audit function.\n\nI. INITIAL VERIFICATION\n\n1. Perform an initial analysis of the Income Tax Returns (BIR Form No. 1701C) selected for audit pursuant to the selective audit procedures prescribed in RMO No. 36-90. Verify completeness of information in the return and of required supporting documents and check mathematical accuracy.\n\n2. Send communication to the taxpayer regarding information requirements. (Refer to Annex A and B for sample communication forms on taxable and refundable cases, respectively.)\n\n3. Arrange a meeting with the taxpayer to facilitate completion of the case. (Scheduled meetings must be strictly monitored to impress upon the taxpayer the importance of the case at hand.)\n\nII. AUDIT OF INCOME\n\n1. Examine pertinent compensation agreement such as contract of employment or crewing agreement to verify if there are special privileges (paid vacation, use of company car, housing, bonus allowances, etc.) and other forms of income received by the taxpayer which are taxable and have not been reported.\n\nNote: Gross income of a non-resident citizen outside the Philippines includes all income enumerated under Section 28 (a) of the NIRC, whether or not such income is exempted from income tax in the foreign country it was derived. However, regarding special privileges granted to non-resident citizens on their gross compensation income apply the convenience rule per Revenue Regulations Nos. 12-86 and 6-82 as follows:\n\n\"If, however, living quarters or meals are furnished to an employee for the convenience of the employer, the value thereof need not be included as compensation subject to withholding.\"\n\n2. Examine the income reported in the foreign income tax return and/or withholding tax statement attached to the foreign return, if any, and reconcile amount indicated therein with the amount of income declared in BIR Form No. 1701C.\n\n3. Consider reasonableness of the taxpayer as indicated in the personal exemption section of the tax return and, when in doubt, require presentation of legal papers.\n\nIV. [n]\u2002\u2002AUDIT OF OTHER ITEMS IN THE RETURN\n\n1. Determine propriety of taxpayer's classification as a Non-Resident Citizen under Section 21(b) of the NIRC by examining passports, copies of employer's certification showing inclusive dates of service or stay abroad and/or seamen's book, whichever is applicable.\n\nNotes: Make reference to various BIR Rulings and Issuances concerning the status and residence of non-resident citizens, some of which are summarized below:\n\nNo. 060-83:Filipino citizens employed by the International Cotton Advisory Committee, a public International Organization entitled to enjoy the privileges exemptions and immunities conferred by the International Organization Immunities Act are non-resident citizens subject to Philippine income tax.\n\nNo. 061-83: A Filipino permanent resident of the United Kingdom, by virtue of his physical presence abroad with definite intention to reside therein is considered a non-resident citizen.\n\nNo. 130-84: An employee of the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) and holder of a G-4 Visa is a non-resident citizen.\n\nNo. 026-86: A Filipino citizen who works in Hongkong from Monday to Friday and spends his weekends and a 6-week vacation leave in the Philippines is considered as a non-resident citizen.\n\nNo. 150-86: A Filipina wife of a US citizen, living on the income from husband's investments (in countries other than the U.S. and R.P.), who spends life travelling around the world (on tourist visas) with husband when not in the countries of their respective citizenships and who doesn't have any permanent residence anywhere is not a non-resident citizen within the contemplation of the Tax Code. cdtai\n\nNo. 283-86: The Filipino crewmen of international vessels of wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Philippine National Oil Company are considered contract workers, hence, non-resident citizens.\n\nNo. 307-88: Ministers of Iglesia ni Kristo (INK) assigned in Hawaii are considered non-resident citizens.\n\nNo. 169-90: Officials of the United Nations (U.N.) including its specialized agencies (pursuant to the Convention on Privileges and Immunities of the Specialized Agencies of the U.N. adopted by the General Assembly on November 21, 1947) who are certified as such by the U.N., United Nations Industrial Development Organization and International Atomic Energy Agency shall be exempt from income tax.\n\nFor contract workers, apply the test as the required length of stay abroad of not less than 183 days. Refer to Memorandum dated June 9, 1981 issue by then Acting Commissioner of Internal Revenue to The Chief of the International Operations Division for the guidelines to be observed, as follows:\n\n\"For example, an individual was employed on board an international carrier from March 29, 1980. Although his presence abroad was less than 183 days in 1980, for purposes of characterizing him as non-resident citizen with respect to his compensation income from without the Philippines, he should be considered as having been physically present abroad for not less than 183 days by taking into account also the number of days of his physical presence abroad during the year immediately preceding the current taxable year under consideration.\n\nIf, during the taxable year, the contract of employment is terminated and within the same taxable year his contract of employment was renewed or he was re-employed and, pursuant to such renewed contract of employment or re-employment, he is required to perform the service outside the Philippines for a period extending beyond the taxable year, he should likewise be considered as physically present abroad most of the time during the taxable year and therefore qualifies as non-resident Filipino citizen with respect to his compensation income from sources outside the Philippines.\"\n\n2. Ask taxpayer as to whether his/her spouse worked abroad during the taxable year and consolidate any of such income in the return if said spouse is a Filipino. If income has been derived locally by the spouse, require filing of separate return using BIR Form No. 1701A or 1701.\n\n3. Conversion of the tax due to be paid in Philippine peso or other foreign currencies to U.S. dollar must be made in accordance with the rules prescribed under Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 76-91.\n\nThe following examples shall govern the computations:\n\nA) Erroneous conversion from foreign currency other than U.S. dollar to U.S. dollar.\n\nMs. I. Hamilton, a Filipino, legally separated, immigrant to Australia. In 1990, she derived income from the following employees in Australia:\n\nAn audit of the income tax return filed by Ms. I. Hamilton was made by the BIR and the assessment was prepared on June 28, 1991:\n\nComputations made per audit:\n\nB) Erroneous U.S. dollar/Philippine peso rate used upon filing and payment of income tax:\n\nN.A. Villas, Filipino, head of the family, is a contract worker in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia. For the taxable year 1989, he earned a basic salary of U.S. $ 7,350.00. Mr. Villas filed his income tax return on March 26, 1990. The following applicable rates are given: casia\n\n4) In addition to the rules prescribed in RMC No. 76-91, the following procedures will have to be followed to govern the conversion of currencies in situations wherein there are withholding of taxes made by the local recruitment agency as evidenced by the W-2:\n\na. Use the conversion rate adopted in the withholding tax statement (W-2).\n\nb. If the withholding tax statement is stated only in Philippine peso, convert to U.S. dollar using the average Peso/dollar exchange rate during the taxable year.\n\nc. If the withholding tax statement is stated only in foreign currency other than U.S. dollar, convert to U.S. dollar using the average foreign currency/U.S. dollar conversion rate during the taxable year.\n\nd. If there are differences in the conversion rates as prescribed above, use the conversion rate which will result in the higher gross income and/or tax liability.\n\n5. Based on audit findings above, recompute the correct amount of tax refundable/collectible and accomplish BIR Form No. 1749-A entitled \"Audit Sheet for Individual Non-Resident Citizen\" (Refer to Annex C.)\n\n6. Notify taxpayer of the corresponding proposed assessment by sending the Preliminary Assessment Notice.\n\n7. If a refund for overpayment or double payment is found in order, accomplish also the \"Audit Sheet for Individual Non-Resident Citizen\" and process pursuant to the provisions of RMO 28-89.\n\nV. OTHER REQUIREMENTS\n\nVerify the completeness of the attachment of the following basic documents:\n\nA) If the income of the non-resident citizen consists of income from business, a signed statement showing the amount of gross receipt, cost of sales and gross income. If from compensation, statement of earnings or certificate from employer.\n\nB) Copy of the income tax return filed with the government of the foreign country where income is earned and proof of payment of foreign taxes paid.\n\nC) Proof of intention to reside permanently abroad or to return and reside permanently in the Philippines which may be any of the following:\n\n1) If immigrant, photocopy of foreign visa.\n\n2) If permanent employee assigned abroad, a certification from his employer showing the nature, duration of his contract and/or period covered by services rendered abroad;\n\n3) If contract worker, (a) photocopy of Seaman's Certificate or (b) contract of employment, (c) certification from the employer showing the nature, duration of his contract and/or period covered by his services rendered abroad.\n\n4) If returning resident, photocopy of passport showing the stamp of the Philippine Commission on Immigration and Deportation to the effect that said non-resident intends to reside permanently in the Philippines.\n\nAn audit of the income tax return filed by Mr. Villas was made and assessment prepared on June 28, 1991:\n\nC) Failure to qualify as non-resident citizen.\n\nA.M. Verague, Filipino, married to F.P. Verague, a seaman employed by Eastgate (International) Maritime Agencies, Inc. from July 3, 1990 to November 30, 1990. In 1990, he earned a basic salary of 9,600 Saudi Riyal inclusive of the amount of tax withheld from such income by the local recruitment agency totalling to U.S. $ 10.55 or the equivalent of P226.04. cdt\n\nMr. Verague filed his income tax return on April 2, 1991. The following conversion rates are given:\n\nAn audit of the income tax return filed by Mr. Verague was made on June 28, 1991 and it was found out that he did not qualify as a non-resident citizen for the taxable year 1990 because has actual stay abroad was less than 183 days.\n\nComputations made per audit:\n\nD) BIR Form W-2 (Certificate of Tax Withheld on Compensation), if applicable. cd i\n\nVI. COMPROMISE PENALTIES\n\nCompromise penalties accruing to the taxpayer for internal revenue violations must be collected according to the \"Revised Schedule of Compromise Penalties\" as embodied in Revenue Memorandum Order No. 1-90.\n\nThis order takes effect immediately.\n\n(SGD.)

                                    "Details": "I. SCOPE\n\nThis Order prescribes the guidelines on the issuance of tentative tax credit certificate for value-added tax (VAT), the nature of which is tentative pending the final determination of the creditable or refundable amount to which the claimant is entitled under a letter of authority pursuant to RAMO 1-91.\n\nII. ADMINISTRATIVE REQUIREMENTS\n\n1. MINIMUM qualifications\n\na) The tentative tax credit certificate is only available to a claimant whose transactions are zero-rated or effectively zero-rated and the amount of which constitutes at least 70% of total annual sales.\n\nExample 1\n\nABC Company has a total sales for the period of P2,000,000.00, the breakdown of which as shown in the books of accounts, VAT returns and others accounting records consist of the following:\n\nb) 100% of the proceeds of export sales test-checked must have been inwardly remitted.\n\n2. Deadline\n\nThe issuance of tax credit certificate (TCC) shall be made within 20 days from the date of scheduled test-checking as determined under Item III (1) (b) hereof.\n\n3. Documents to be submitted\n\na. Application for VAT credit/refund (BIR Form No. 2552).\n\nb. VAT returns (BIR Form No. 2550) for the quarter(s) in which the zero-rated transactions were declared and the amount of claim reflected. A minimum of 4-quarter VAT returns is required to be attached although the claim may cover only one quarter (for the purpose of determining the 70% minimum requirement).\n\nc. Copy of approved application for zero-rate, when applicable.\n\nd. Summary list of sales with corresponding foreign currency inward remittances. It must show:\n\nA. Goods\n\n1. Export sales including foreign currency denominated sales\n\na. Date of export\n\nb. Sales invoice number\n\nc. Name of buyer\n\nd. Airway Bill/Bill of lading number\n\ne. Lading date\n\nf. Amount of sales in foreign currency\n\ng. Peso conversion rate\n\nh. Date of remittance\n\ni. Bank credit memo number\n\nj. Amount remitted in pesos\n\nB. Service\n\na. Breakdown of gross foreign currency receipts into commission, allotment manning fee, agency fee, advances, etc.\n\nb. Peso conversion rate\n\nc. Bank credit memo number\n\nd. Name of Bank\n\ne. Date of remittance\n\nf. Amount remitted in pesos\n\nC. Effectively zero-rated sales of goods and services\n\na. Name of person or entity to whom the goods were delivered or services rendered\n\nb. Date of delivery or billing\n\nc. Amount of consideration\n\nd. Description of goods delivered or services rendered\n\ne. Document of liquidation, when applicable (RR 2-88)\n\ne. Summary list of purchases per supplier containing the following details:\n\na. Name of supplier\n\nb. VAT number\n\nc. Invoice/OR number\n\nd. Date of Invoice/OR\n\ne. Amount\n\nf. Input Tax\n\ng. Total invoice amount\n\nh. The claimant must sort and batch his invoices/receipts per supplier for easy checking.\n\nIt is understood that the claimant has sorted and batched his invoices/receipts per supplier for easy checking.\n\nf. Bank credit memos, certificate of foreign currency inward remittances and/or certification from the Central Bank of approved offset arrangement and non-violation of Central Bank rules and regulations.\n\ng. Certification of non-filing of claim for tax credit/refund from BOI, EPZA, Bureau of Customs or other government offices.\n\nh. Sworn statement that the inventory of goods from which input tax credits had been claimed were subsequently used in the zero-rated sale of goods and services.\n\ni. Statement of payback liability of claimant for undue credit arising from fraudulent claim and/or fake invoices or receipts, inclusive of civil and penal liabilities.\n\n4. Receipt of Documents\n\nNo application under this Order shall be received unless it is accompanied by each and every document required to be submitted. Each of the document shall be conspicuously stamped with the word \"RECEIVED\".\n\n5. Reconcile\n\na. The amount of zero-rated sales declared in BIR Form 2552, BIR Form 2550, summary list of sales, sales ledger accounts, bank credit memos and bank certificate of inward remittance of foreign currency; and\n\nb. The amount of purchases and corresponding input tax credits declared in BIR Form 2550 with that shown in the summary list of purchases, subsidiary purchase journal and BIR Form 2552.\n\n6. Test-check:\n\na. Date of test-checking shall be scheduled on the date agreed upon between the applicant and the assigned revenue officer, but no sooner than the date the last supporting document was submitted.\n\nb. At least 20% of the total amount of input tax credits claimed per summary lists with that shown in the original invoices/receipts. As far as practicable, the test-checking shall be spread out to the invoices/receipts of all suppliers. Purchase invoices involving substantial amounts shall be cross-checked with the records of the suppliers.\n\nc. At least 20% of sales in the summary list with that of the original sales invoices/receipts and corresponding foreign currency inward remittance (if applicable).\n\nThe 20% of sales and input tax credits in purchases to be test-checked shall be pre-determined and indicated on the summary lists by the Chief of the Value-Added Tax Division or authorized officer.\n\nUpon discovery of substantial unsupported input tax credits, or circumstances suggesting the presence of fraud or tax liability in excess of credits, the claim shall be recommended for regular audit.\n\nThe claim is considered substantially unsupported or unacceptable if more than 40% of the amount of the claim test-checked is unsupported or based on invoices/receipts which had been found to be unacceptable in accordance with the existing invoicing requirements.\n\n7. Maximum amount\n\nThe amount of tentative Tax Credit Certificate that may be issued under this Order shall not exceed 40% of the amount of claim.\n\nTo determine: a) the amount of the tentative tax credit to be granted; or b) whether the claim shall be recommended for regular audit, use the ratio of allowable input tax credit test-checked over the input tax credit test-checked, computed as follows:\n\nExample 2\n\nAssuming that the amount of purchases is P1,000.00 and the amount of claimed input tax credits is P10,000, the amount of input tax credits to be checked is P2,000. Result of test-checking shows an allowable input tax credit of only P1,420.\n\na. Under the foregoing example, the taxpayer is entitled to 71% of P4,000 or P2,840.\n\nb. If more than 40% of P2,000 has been found to be unsupported or unacceptable, the claim shall be referred for regular audit.\n\nIII. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS\n\n1. Time to submit report\n\na. The Revenue Officer who conducted the test-checking shall immediately uniform the claimant of:\n\n1. Unacceptable invoices or receipts due to non-compliance with the existing invoicing requirements; and\n\n2. Any discovery of fraud or tax liability, etc.\n\nSufficient time shall be given to claimant to explain or account for the findings or discrepancies within the reporting period.\n\nb. Report shall be submitted by the Revenue Officer within 15 days from the scheduled first day of test-checking.\n\n2. Form and content of report\n\na. The test-checking report shall be made in BIR Form No. (Annex \"A\").\n\nb. The amount of input tax credit test-checked against the original invoices should be at least 20% of the purchase invoices or receipts or of the amount claimed.\n\nc. It shall be specific as to the amount of TCC to be issued which in no case shall exceed 40% of the amount of claim.\n\nd. The TCC shall be issued with the note \"GRANTED UNDER RAMO NO. ___\"\n\n3. Cancellation of Invoices/receipts\n\nUpon the issuance of TCC, but before the delivery of the certificate to the applicant, each and every invoice/receipt shall be cancelled with the note\n\nIV. TRANSITORY PROVISION\n\nApplication for the issuance of TCC received before the effectivity of this Order may be processed under this system, at the option of the applicant, provided that the required letter of authority has not been issued or it may have already been issued but the verification of the claim has not yet been started.\n\nV. EFFECTIVITY\n\nThis Order shall take effect immediately. Strict compliance herewith is enjoined.\n\n(SGD.) EUFRACIO D. SANTOS\nDeputy Commissioner Officer-in-Charge",

SCOPE:\n\nThis order shall govern the audit of claims for refund or tax credit of value-added tax arising from zero-rated transactions, as well as purchase or importation of capital goods. cdt\n\nII. ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES:\n\n1. That every audit of claim for refund or tax credit shall be covered by a Letter of Authority (LA).\n\n2. That any outstanding delinquent account shall first be settled by the claimant before the refund/tax credit certificate (TCC) shall be issued either by agreeing to the issuance of a separate TCC that may be used only to pay the said account or by paying in cash. Under the former, the fact that it shall be used only for the payment of the delinquent account shall be indicated on the face of the TCC. Refund or TCC shall then be issued for the excess of the approved claim over the delinquent account.\n\nWhere the delinquent account has been protested, the claim for refund/TCC may be given due course provided that the protest has been filed in accordance with Revenue Regulations No. 12-85. Such fact shall be certified to by the Chief, Receivable Account Division not later than 5 days from date of referral.\n\n3. That any finding of deficiency internal revenue taxes other than value-added tax and other taxes covered on the LA shall be referred to the proper audit office.\n\n4. That the 60-day period for the processing of claims for refund/tax credit shall start on the day of submission of the last of the documents specified in the checklist of requirements (Annex B).\n\n5. That the Tax Credit Certificate (TCC) issued may be used by the grantee or his assignee in payment of any of their direct internal revenue tax liability.\n\nIII. AUDIT PROCEDURES:\n\nA. Objective: To ascertain the refundable/creditable VAT input tax on zero-rated transactions.\n\nB. Pre-audit Steps:\n\nEssential to an effective audit is familiarization with \u2014\n\n1. the business organization of the taxpayer, and whether it has business establishments other than its main or head office;\n\n2. the economic activity, whether engaged in the sale of goods and/or sale of services, etc.\n\n3. the accounting methods and policies, and the degree of internal control, etc.\n\nIt may also be necessary to refer to the report of the audit of the value-added tax liabilities of the taxpayer for the immediately preceding period in order to be aware of the deficiencies that were reported, but may have remained uncorrected in the current period under audit.\n\n4. Export sales of non-VAT taxpayers should be treated as mere VAT exempt sales (Section 103 (v)). In the case of VAT taxpayer claiming zero-rating treatment under special laws, international agreements or Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 2-88, prior approval of application is a mandatory condition to entitlement.\n\n5. Determine if the claim was filed within two (2) years \u2014\n\n(a) in the case of export sales, within 2 years from the date of exportation\n\n(b) in case of importation or local purchase of capital equipment, within 2 years after the lapse of 180 days from the last day of the quarter in which the purchase was made.\n\n(c) in the case of other zero-rated transactions, within 2 years from the date of the transaction.\n\nC. Audit of Sales and Output Tax\n\nA. Gross Taxable Sale of Goods and Services \u2014\n\n1. Reconcile the amount of each category of sales per VAT return with the recorded amount of sales per subsidiary sales journal, including the control subsidiary sales ledger and/or the general ledger of the head office, and any subsidiary sales journal for each branch, and with the reported zero-rated sales per application for VAT refund/ tax credit (BIR Form No. 2552). casia\n\nAny discrepancy noted should at once be brought to the attention of the taxpayer for reconciliation/explanation.\n\n2. Review the composition of the sales account in the journals and ledgers and ascertain that:\n\n2.1 Only those transactions which are specifically exempt under Section 103 of NIRC are treated as exempt sales.\n\n2.2 \"Deemed\" sales of goods are recorded as taxable transactions (Sec. 4, RR 5-87).\n\n2.2.1 Transfer use, or consumption not in the course of business of goods originally intended for sale or for use in the course of business. Transfer of goods not in the course of business can take place when the VAT-registered person withdraws goods from his business for his personal use;\n\n2.2.2 Distribution or transfer to shareholders or investors as share in the profits of the business;\n\n2.2.3 Transfer to creditors in payment of debt or obligation;\n\n2.2.4 Consignment of goods if actual sale is not made within 60 days following the date such goods were consigned. Consigned goods returned by the consignee within the 60-pay period is not deemed sold; and\n\n2.2.5 Retirement from or cessation of business or death of an individual with respect to inventories of all goods on hand, whether capital goods stock-in-trade, supplies or materials as of date of such retirement or cessation, whether or not the business is continued by the new owner or successor, estate or heir. The following circumstances shall, among others, give rise to transactions \"deemed sale.\"\n\ni. Change of ownership of business or incorporation of the business in the case of a single proprietorship;\n\nii. Dissolution of a partnership and creation of a new partnership which takes over the business; and\n\niii. Death of an individual who is a VAT-registered person, even if the estate or heirs of the decedent shall continue to operate the business.\n\n2.3 Sales declared as zero-rated actually emanate from export sales, foreign currency denominated sales, and other transactions that may qualify as zero-rated sales or effectively zero-rated sales (Sec. 100 (a) (1) (2), 102 (a) (1) (2) (3), NIRC and Sec. 8, RR 5-87).\n\n2.3.1 For \"direct export sales\", examine sales agreement with foreign buyers as to the nature of products to be exported, pricing and other terms and conditions. Review export documents such as commercial invoices/receipts, bills of lading or airway bill, export declaration/permit, packing list, etc; and ascertain that the proceeds of the sale had been actually inwardly remitted. This will require a liquidation statement from the Central Bank or any of its accredited agent banks certifying as to the amount of the export proceeds or consideration, the date of inward remittance, conversion rate and the total peso value thereof (RMO 23-88). Determine if proceeds of export sales (Paragraphs 1 and 2 of Section 100) had been actually remitted in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Central Bank. Prepare and submit schedule I with the following information:\n\nSCHEDULE I\n\n2.3.2 For foreign currency denominated sales, review the transactions and ascertain the following:\n\ni. The buyers are Filipinos residing abroad, returning overseas workers or other non-residents;\n\nii. The objects of sale are goods for household or personal use assembled or manufactured in the Philippines and delivered to residents of the Philippines.\n\niii. The goods are paid for in convertible foreign currency inwardly remitted through the banking system. This requirement may be evidenced by a statement from the Central Bank or its accredited bank.\n\niv. The sales do not exceed an aggregate value of US$1,000 or its equivalent.\n\nClaims for refund/tax credit arising from this transaction shall be checked from the Philippine International Trading Corporation or the appropriate government agency charged with the implementation of this scheme.\n\n2.3.3 For zero-rated sale of services, verify contract agreement to ascertain the person for whom the services was rendered, amount of consideration, description of the services, and documents evidencing actual payments. Determine if proceeds of sale in foreign currency (Paragraphs 1 and 2 of Section 102) had been inwardly remitted in accordance with CB rules and regulations. Prepare and submit schedule II with the following information:\n\nSCHEDULE II\n\n2.3.4 In case of constructive inward remittance the claimant shall also submit the following:\n\n1. Central Bank approval of off-setting arrangement.\n\n2. Certification from the Central Bank on the amount constructively remitted under the off-setting arrangement.\n\nShould the amount of inward remittance be less than the total zero-rated sales, the input tax pertaining to the discrepancy shall be removed from the allowable input tax using the following formula:\n\n2.3.5 For effectively zero-rated transaction, secure copy of the approved application for zero-rating. Take note of the effectivity and revocation date of zero-rated transaction. Transactions effected before the effectivity date as indicated in the approved application are subject to VAT (RR No. 2-88).\n\n3. Analyze all the accounts affecting total sales, particularly cash account; accounts and/or notes receivable; collections from receivables; sales discounts and sales returns; bad debts written-off; etc.\n\nIn the case of sale of service, include in the analysis other accounts such as advances, retention receivables, mobilization fees, etc.\n\n3.1 Apply the following pro-forma computation to arrive at the total sale of goods \u2014\n\n3.2 Apply the following pro-forma computation to arrive at the gross receipts during the period \u2014\n\nD. Audit checks to detect irregularities in invoicing and accounting for transactions\n\n1. Scrutinize the entries appearing in the subsidiary sales journal and compare the same with the information shown in the sales invoices.\n\n2. Determine compliance with invoicing requirements and procedures.\n\n2.1 Ascertain that invoices bear all necessary information including the VAT registration number (Sec. 108(a) and 238, NIRC).\n\n2.2 For the verification of the VAT liabilities for the 1st quarter/semester of 1988, account for the unused sales invoices as of December 31, 1987, as prescribed under RMC No. 51-87, and verify authority to print subsequent receipts/invoices. Any discovery of discrepancy or the use of unauthorized receipts or invoice the printing of which are not authorized may suggest fraudulent practices.\n\n2.3 Check authority to use cash register machines and verify whether each register machine in use is duly authorized.\n\n2.4 Ensure that the sales invoices issued for sales transactions are all accounted for Account for any break in the sequence of serial numbers of sales invoices and official receipts issued, and invoices assigned to branches. In case of cancelled sales invoice, the original copy should be on file. For those using looseleaf invoices, require presentation of authority to use the same.\n\n2.5 Be alert on the use of double set of invoices bearing identical serial numbers.\n\n2.6 Verify if the transactions covered by \"Statement of Account\", Delivery Receipt\", \"Debit Notes\", and other similar documents are properly recorded as sales. The mere issuance of these documents without the corresponding sales invoice is a violation of the bookkeeping regulations and an indication of unrecorded sales except in the case of bona fide consignment sales.\n\nWhen confronted with a delivery receipt, ascertain whether it covers a consummated sale of consignment sale. Consignment sale shall be considered as taxable sale after sixty (60) days following the date of consignment (Sec. 4(d), RR 5-87).\n\n2.7 If the taxpayer is engaged in both taxable and exempt transactions, ascertain that only VAT invoices are issued for VAT taxable transactions and separate invoices are issued for exempt transactions (Sec. 21 RR 5-87). Exempt transactions for which VAT invoices are issued shall be considered subject to VAT.\n\n2.8 In the case of zero-rated transactions to BOI export-oriented enterprises or other entities whose purchases are effectively zero-rated or exempted under special laws or international agreement, check if the words \"ZERO-RATED\" or \"EXEMPT\" had been prominently stamped or printed on the face of the sales invoice. If not, the transactions should be considered taxable (Sec. 2(a)(3), RR 2-88).\n\n3. Determine the manner of billing the value-added tax. If the VAT is not separately billed or is erroneously billed in the invoice, multiply the gross amount of sales (including the amount intended by the seller to cover the tax or the tax billed erroneously) by 1/11 or such other factor applicable to persons partially exempt under special laws to determine the correct output tax (Sec. 6(a) and (b), RR 5-87).\n\n4. If the taxpayer enjoys full or partial exemption from payment of the value-added tax pursuant to special laws, verify the extent of exemption and compliance with the condition of such exemptions. Determine the amount of output tax by applying the corresponding factor applicable to the level of exemption:\n\n5. Verify whether other charges such as excise taxes, packaging, insurance, freight and delivery expenses, etc., are treated as part of the gross taxable sales.\n\n6. In the case of gross taxable sales of services (GTSS), advance payment or downpayment or deposits, as well as the cost of materials supplied with the services shall form part of the GTSS. If it is claimed that the material component of the contract price is for the account of the customer or contractee, verify the terms of the contract to ascertain who actually made the purchase and in whose name the transaction was invoiced.\n\n7. Identify instances of gross selling prices of goods and services being unreasonably lower than the actual market price, and make the necessary adjustments (Sec. 6(a), RR 5-87).\n\n8. Account for deductions from sales such as sales returns, allowances and discounts. Sales returns and allowances may be deducted from the gross taxable sale if they have been previously recorded and are properly supported by debit memos. Discounts, on the other hand, can only be taken into account if indicated on the face of the invoice at the time of sale and without condition as to subsequent happening of an event or fulfillment of certain conditions such as prompt payment or attainment of sales goals (Sec. 100 (d)(3).\n\n9. For VAT taxpayer claiming the privilege of paying the 4% contractor's tax after December 31, 1987, verify his compliance with the following conditions:\n\n9.1 Filing of information return showing the contractor's name, the outstanding contract price as of December 31, 1987, and a declaration to pay the contractor's tax due.\n\n9.2 Copy of the contractor's billing issued prior to January 1, 1988 must be attached to the information return.\n\n9.3 Ascertain the recording of the outstanding contract price receivable (on contracts completed and billed as of December 31, 1987) on the taxpayers books of accounts.\n\n9.4 Filing of the contractor's tax return on or before January 30, 1988 or the 20th day of the month following the end of each calendar quarter.\n\nNon-compliance with any of the above condition subjects the amount received to 10% VAT (Sec. 6(g) of RR 5-87).\n\n10. Be resourceful in discovering underdeclaration of sales. Abnormal levels of: inventories, sales, purchases, accounts receivables, including manipulations on interbranch transactions, among others, etc., may suggest instances of underdeclaration. Cross-check transactions reflected in the books of accounts against the records of selected customers and suppliers.\n\nE. Audit of Purchases and Input Tax\n\n1. Reconcile the amount of each category of purchases per VAT return with the amount of purchases per subsidiary purchase journal (Sec. 22(b), RR 5-87). Check if all the information required are maintained in the purchase journal.\n\n2. Review the composition of the purchase accounts in the journals and ledgers and ascertain that:\n\n2.1 Purchases from non-VAT and/or exempt persons do not result in any input tax credit.\n\n2.2 Effectively zero-rated purchases do not result in any input tax credit. cd i\n\n2.3 Purchases from VAT persons which are personal in nature, shall not give rise to input tax credit.\n\n2.4 Deemed-paid input tax credits (for purchases from BOI-registered pioneer enterprises) have been determined correctly in accordance with Sec. 13(4) of RR 5-87.\n\n3. Scrutinize the entries appearing in the subsidiary purchase journal and compare with information shown on the purchase invoice.\n\n4. Determine substantiation of claims for input tax credits.\n\n4.1 The purchase invoice is issued in the name of the VAT-registered taxpayer claiming the input credits; bears the VAT number of the seller; the goods/services purchased are adequately described; the date of the invoice falls within the period being claimed; and the printer's authority to print is indicated thereon. In case of purchase of services, the same should be supported by official receipts.\n\n4.2 For domestic purchases of goods (including capital assets) and services in the course of business, these must be supported by VAT invoices or receipts showing the information required in Sec. 108(a) and 238 of the NIRC. A cash register machine tape, although it indicates the VAT registration number of the seller, does not constitute valid proof of input tax credit. (Sec. 15(a), RR 4-87). The same condition will apply for delivery receipts or statements of accounts issued by the seller.\n\n4.3 Credit for input tax on importation shall be supported with import entries or equivalent documents showing actual payment of VAT on imported goods (Sec. 15(b), RR 5-87). Therefore, withdrawals of raw materials or other goods for customs bonded warehouses without the payment of VAT are not entitled to input tax credit.\n\n4.4 VAT invoices issued for exempt and zero-rated transactions will not generate input credits to the purchaser.\n\n5. Determine the manner of billing on purchase invoice or receipt to ascertain correctness of input tax credits (Sec. 13, RR 5-87).\n\n6. Ascertain that purchase returns and allowances granted to the taxpayer results in a corresponding reduction in the input tax credit balance (Sec. 6(c) of RR 5-87).\n\n7. If the taxpayer enjoys exemption on its sales of goods or services under special laws, he is only entitled to input tax credits equivalent to his level of exemption in the year of sale.\n\nFor example:\n\nX, a BOI-registered pioneer enterprise, enjoys a 100% tax exemption for the taxable year under investigation. During the same year, his sales amounted to P1,000,000 and the input tax on his purchases amounted to P50,000. The creditable input tax shall be computed as follows:\n\n8. Applications for the issuance of tax credit certificates and refund affecting the input tax credit accounts must reduce the input tax credit available at the time of application. These include not only applications for the TCC filed with the BIR, but also with other government agencies such as the BOI and the Bureau of Customs (Sec. 11, RR 5-87). acd\n\n9. If a VAT-registered person is also engaged in exempt activities, the input taxes paid for purchase of goods (including capital goods) and services which cannot be attributed to either operation shall be allocated between the VAT taxable operation and the non-VAT operation using the computation prescribed in Sec. 12 of RR 5-87. The amount allocated to the exempt transaction should reduce the input tax credit balance.\n\n10. Reconcile the amounts of put tax claimed in the VAT return for the portion carried over from previous quarters and the balance carried to succeeding quarters with the amounts recorded in the books of accounts.\n\n11. Ascertain that the recorded amount of the purchase of goods, services and capital goods are net of VAT.\n\n12. Presumptive input tax and deemed paid input tax credit are not qualified for refund or issuance of Tax Credit Certificate. acd\n\nF. Cancellation of Original Purchase Invoices/Receipts\n\nUpon the final approval of the claim, but before the preparation of the tax credit certificate or disbursement voucher for refunds, the sources of allowed, or disallowed input tax credits such as the original purchase invoices and official receipts shall be cancelled with the words \"cancelled\" stamped on the invoice or official receipt. The cancellation shall also be initialed by the cancelling officer.\n\nG. Reporting Requirements\n\nThe audit report should be brief and concise but complete in all details necessary to its understanding. It must be accompanied by \u2014\n\n1. Copy of the letter of authority.\n\n2. VAT returns for the audited period, together with proofs of payment of VAT.\n\n3.

AUDIT OF SALES AND OUTPUT TAX\n\nA. Gross Taxable Sale of Goods and Services\n\n1. Reconcile the amount of each category of sales per VAT return with the recorded amount of sales per subsidiary sales journal, including the control subsidiary sales ledger and/or the general ledger of the head office, and any subsidiary sales journal for each branch.\n\n2. Review the composition of the sales account in the journals and ledgers and ascertain that:\n\n2.1 Only those transactions which are specifically exempted under Section 103 officially exempted under Section 103 of NIRC are treated as exempt sales.\n\n2.2 \"Deemed\" sales of goods are recorded as taxable transactions (Sec. 4, RR 5-87).\n\n2.2.1 Transfer, use or consumption not in the course of business of goods originally intended for sale or for use in the course of business. Transfer of goods not in the course of business can take place when the VAT-registered person withdraws goods from his business for his personal use;\n\n2.2.2 Distribution or transfer to shareholders or investors as share in the profits of the business;\n\n2.2.3 Transfer to creditors in payment of debt or obligation;\n\n2.2.4 Consignment of goods if actual sale is not made within 60 days following the date such goods were consigned. Consigned goods returned by the consignee within the 60-day period is not deemed sold; and\n\n2.2.5 Retirement from or cessation of business or death of an individual with respect to inventories of all goods on hand, whether capital goods, stock-in-trade, supplies or materials as of date of such retirement or cessation, whether or not the business is continued by the new owner or successor, estate or heir. The following circumstances shall, among others, give rise to transactions \"deemed sale\":\n\ni Change of ownership of business or incorporation of the business in the case of a single proprietorship;\n\nii Dissolution of a partnership and creation of a new partnership which takes over the business; and\n\niii Death of an individual who is a VAT-registered person, even if the estate or heirs of the decedent shall continue to operate the business.\n\n2.3 Sales declared as zero-rated actually emanate from export sales, foreign currency denominated sales, and other transactions that may qualify as zero-rated sales or effectively zero-rated sales (Sec. 100 (a) (1) (2), 102 (a) (1) (2) (3), NIRC and Sec. 8, RR 5-87).\n\n2.3.1 For \"direct export sales\", review export documents such as commercial invoice/receipts, bills of lading or airway bill, export declaration/permit, packing list, etc; and ascertain that the proceeds of the sale had been actually inwardly remitted. This will require a liquidation statement from the Central Bank or any of its accredited agent banks certifying as to the amount of the export proceeds or consideration, the date of inward remittance, conversion rate and the total peso value thereof (RMO 23-88).\n\n2.3.2 For \"foreign currency denominated sales\" review the transactions and ascertain the following:\n\ni The buyer is a non-resident.\n\nii The goods are assembled or manufactured in the Philippines for household or personal use.\n\niii The goods are paid for in convertible foreign currency inwardly remitted through the banking system. This requirement may be evidenced by a statement from the Central Bank or its accredited bank.\n\niv The sales do not exceed an aggregate value of US $1,000 or its equivalent.\n\n2.3.3 For zero-rated sale of services, review copy of the contract to ascertain the person for whom the services were rendered, amount of consideration and description of the services rendered. The compliance for the requirement for inward remittance should be evidenced by statement of liquidation from the Central Bank or its accredited agent bank.\n\n2.3.4 For effectively zero-rated transaction, secure copy of the approved application for zero-rating. Take note of the effectivity and revocation date of zero-rated transaction. Transaction effected before the effectivity date as indicated in the approved application are subject to VAT (RMO No. 2-88).\n\n3. Analyze all the accounts affecting total sales, particularly cash account; accounts and/or notes receivable; collections from receivables; sales discounts and sales returns; bad debts written-off; etc.\n\nIn the case of sale of service, include in the analysis other accounts such as advances, retention receivables, mobilization fees, etc.\n\n3.1 Apply the following pro-forma computation to arrive at the total sale of goods \u2014\n\n3.2 Account for the quantity of goods actually sold in appropriate cases, as a tool to further audit \u2014\n\n3.4  Apply the following pro-forma computation to arrive at the gross receipts during the period \u2014\n\nNOTE:  ALL ACCOUNTS SHOULD BE NET OF VAT.\n\nB. Audit checks to detect irregularities in invoicing and accounting for transactions\n\n1. Scrutinize the entries appearing in the subsidiary sales journal and compare the same with the information shown in the sales invoices.\n\n2. Determine compliance with invoicing requirements and procedures.\n\n2.1 Ascertain that invoices bear all necessary information including the VAT registration number (Sec. 108(a) and 238, NIRC).\n\n2.2 For the verification of the VAT liabilities for the 1st quarter/semester of 1988, account for the unused sales invoices as of December 31, 1987, as prescribed under RMC No. 51-87, and verify authority to print subsequent receipts/invoices. Any discovery of discrepancy or the use of unauthorized receipts or invoice the printing of which are not authorized may suggest fraudulent practices.\n\n2.3 Check authority to use cash register machines and verify whether each register machine in use is duly authorized.\n\n2.4 Ensure that the sales invoices issued for sales transactions are all accounted for. Account for any break in the sequence of serial numbers of sales invoices and official receipts issued and invoices assigned to branches. In case of cancelled sales invoice the original copy should be on file.\n\n2.5 Be alert to the use of double set of invoices bearing identical serial numbers.\n\n2.6 Verify if the transactions covered by \"Statement of Account\", \"Delivery Receipt\", \"Debit Notes\", and other similar documents are properly recorded as sales. The mere issuance of these documents without the corresponding sales invoice is a violation of the bookkeeping regulations and an indication of unrecorded sales except in the case of bona fide consignment sales.\n\nWhen confronted with a delivery receipt, ascertain whether it covers a consummated sale or consignment sale. Consignment sale shall be considered as taxable sale after sixty (60) days following the date of consignment (Sec. 4(D), RR 5-87).\n\n2.7 If the taxpayer is engaged in both taxable and exempt transactions, ascertain that only VAT invoices are issued for VAT taxable transactions and separate invoices are issued for exempt transactions (Sec. 21 RR 5-87). Exempt transactions for which VAT invoices are issued shall be considered subject to VAT.\n\n2.8 In the case of zero-rated transactions to BOI-export-oriented enterprises or other entities whose purchases are effectively zero-rated or exempted under special laws or international agreement, check if the words \"ZERO-RATED\" or \"EXEMPT\" had been prominently stamped or in printed on the sales invoice. If not, the transactions should be considered taxable (Sec. 2(a)(3), RR 2-88).\n\n3. Determine the manner of billing the value-added tax. If the VAT is not separately billed or is erroneously billed in the invoice, multiply the gross amount of sales (including the amount intended by the seller to cover the tax or the tax billed erroneously) by 1/11 or such other factor applicable to persons partially exempt under special laws to determine the correct output tax (Sec. 6(a) and (b), RR 5-87).\n\n4. If the taxpayer enjoys full or partial exemption from payment of the value-added tax pursuant to special laws, verify the extent of exemption and compliance with the condition of such exemptions. Determine the amount of output tax by applying the corresponding factor applicable to the level of exemption:\n\n5. Verify whether other charges such as excise taxes, packaging, insurance, freight and delivery expense, etc., are treated as part of the gross taxable sales.\n\n6. In the case of gross taxable sales of services (GTSS), advance payment or downpayment or deposits, as well as the cost of materials supplied with the services shall form part of the GTSS. If it is claimed that the material component of the contract price is for the account of the customer or contractee, verify the terms of the contract to ascertain who actually made the purchase and in whose name the transaction was invoiced.\n\n7. Identify instances of gross selling prices of goods and services being unreasonably lower than the actual market price, and make the necessary adjustments (Sec. 6(a), RR 5-87).\n\n8. Account for deductions from sales such as sales returns, allowances and discounts. Sales returns and allowances may be deducted from the gross taxable sale if they have been previously recorded and are properly supported by debit memos. Discounts, on the other hand, can only be taken into account if indicated on the face of the invoice at the time of sale and without condition as to subsequent happening of an event or fulfillment of certain conditions such as prompt payment or attainment of sales goals (Sec. 100(d) (3)).\n\n9. For VAT taxpayer claiming the privilege of paying the 4% contractor's tax after December 31, 1987, verify his compliance with the following conditions:\n\n9.1 Filing of information return showing the contractor's name, the outstanding contract price as of December 31, 1987, and a declaration to pay the contractor's tax due.\n\n9.2 Copy of the contractor's billing issued prior to January 1, 1988 must be attached to the information return.\n\n9.3 Ascertain the recording of the outstanding contract price receivable (on contracts completed and billed as of December 31, 1987) on the taxpayers books of accounts.\n\n9.4 Filing of the contractor's tax return on or before January 30, 1988 or the 20th day of the month following the end of each calendar quarter.\n\nNon-compliance with any of the above condition subjects the amount received to 10% VAT (Sec. 6(g) of RR 5-87).\n\n10. Be resourceful in discovering underdeclaration of sales. Abnormal levels of: inventories, sales, purchases, accounts receivables, including manipulation on interbranch transactions, among others, etc., may suggest instances of underdeclaration. Cross-check transactions reflected in the books of accounts against the records of selected customers and suppliers.\n\nII. AUDIT OF PURCHASES AND INPUT TAX\n\n1. Reconcile the amount of each category of purchases per VAT return with the amount of purchases per subsidiary purchases journal (Sec. 22(b), RR 5-87). Check if all the information required are maintained in the purchase journal.\n\n2. Review the composition of the purchase accounts in the journals and ledgers and ascertain that:\n\n2.1 Purchases from non-VAT and/or exempt persons do not result in any input tax credit.\n\n2.2 Effectively zero-rated purchases do not result in any input tax credit.\n\n2.3 Purchases from VAT persons, which are personal in nature, shall not give rise to input tax credit.\n\n2.4 Deemed-paid input tax credits (for purchases from BOI-registered pioneer enterprises) have been determined correctly in accordance with Sec. 13(4) of RR 5-87.\n\n3. Scrutinize the entries appearing in the subsidiary purchase journal and compare with information shown on the purchase invoice.\n\n4. Determine substantiation of claims for input tax credits.\n\n4.1 The purchase invoice is issued in the name of the VAT-registered taxpayer claiming the input credits; bears the VAT number of the seller; the goods/services purchased are adequately described; and the printer's authority to print is indicated thereon.\n\n4.2 For domestic purchases of goods (including capital assets) and services in the course of business, these must be supported by VAT invoices or receipts showing the information required in Sec. 108(a) and 238 of the NIRC. A cash register machine tape, although it indicates the VAT registration number of the seller, does not constitute valid proof of input tax credit (Sec. 15(a) RR 4-87). The same condition will apply for delivery receipts or statements of accounts issued by the seller.\n\n4.3 Credit for input tax on importation shall be supported with import entries or equivalent documents showing actual payment of VAT on imported goods (Sec. 15(b) RR 5-87). Therefore, withdrawals of raw materials or other goods for customs bonded warehouses without the payment of VAT are not entitled to input tax credit.\n\n4.4 VAT invoices issued for exempt and zero-rated transactions will not generate input credits to the purchaser.\n\n5. Determine the manner of billing on purchase invoice or receipt to ascertain correctness of input tax credits (Sec. 13, RR 5-87).\n\n6. Ascertain that purchase returns and allowances granted to the taxpayer results in a corresponding reduction in the input tax credit balance (Sec. 6(c) of RR 5-87).\n\n7. If the taxpayer enjoys exemption on its sale of goods or services under special laws, he is only entitled to input tax credits equivalent to his level of exemption in the year of sale.\n\nFor example:\n\nX, a BOI-registered pioneer enterprise, enjoys a 10% tax exemption for the taxable year under investigation. During the same year, his sales amounted to P1,000,000 and the input tax on his purchases amounted to P50,000. The creditable input tax shall be computed as follows:\n\n8. Applications for the issuance of tax credit certificates and refund affecting the input tax credit accounts must reduce the input tax credit available at the time of application. These include not only applications for the TCC filed with the BIR, but also with other government agencies such as the BOI and the Bureau of Customs (Sec. 11, RR 5-87).\n\n9. If a VAT-registered person is also engaged in exempt activities, the input taxes paid for purchase of goods (including capital goods) and services which cannot be attributed to either operation shall be allocated between the VAT taxable operation and the non-VAT operation using the computation prescribed in Sec. 12 of RR 5-87. The amount allocated to the exempt transaction should reduce the input tax credit balance.\n\nFor instance:\n\n10. Reconcile the amounts of input tax claimed in the VAT return for the portion carried over from previous quarters and the balance carried to succeeding quarters with the amounts recorded in the books of accounts.\n\n11. Ascertain that the recorded amount of the purchase of goods, services and capital goods are net of VAT.\n\nIII. AUDIT OF TRANSITORY INPUT TAX\n\n1. Verify the taxpayers VAT registration date to determine the basis of allowable transitional input tax credits.\n\n1.1 Persons registered under VAT as of January 1, 1988 are entitled to presumptive input tax credit equivalent to the sales tax element present in the inventory as of December 31, 1987 either as a debit balance in the deferred sales tax credit account or 8% of the value of inventory of materials and supplies (Sec. 26, RR 5-87).\n\n1.2 Persons becoming liable to value-added tax after the effectivity of the VAT law are entitled to transitory input tax credit equivalent to 8% of the value of inventory of goods, materials and supplies, the purchase of which was subjected to VAT or the actual value-added tax paid on such goods, materials and supplies, whichever is higher (Sec. 17, RR 5-87).\n\n2. If the taxpayer is a VAT-registered person as of January 1, 1988, determine his entitlement to presumptive input tax, as follows:\n\n2.1 Manufacturers, producers and importers:\n\ni) Deferred sales tax credit balance as of December 31, 1987.\n\nii) Input tax credit equivalent to 8% of the inventory of supplies as of December 31, 1987.\n\niii) In the case of importers, input tax of 8% on the inventory of goods imported in 1985 and prior years, provided that the same had been segregated and recorded as such.\n\n2.2 Persons, other than manufacturers, producers or importers such as construction contractors, service contractors, etc., are entitled to input tax credits equivalent to 8% of the value of the inventory of materials and supplies, other than capital goods, on hand as of December 31, 1987 which were purchased to be used or to be supplied with the sale of services, such as inventory of bags of cement, bond papers, etc. It does not cover goods which were purchased for resale independently of sale of services.\n\n2.3 Wholesalers and retailers:\n\ni) Input tax of 8% of the value of inventory of goods purchased for resale in the same state it was purchased on hand as of December 31, 1987.\n\nii) Input tax of 8% of the value of goods, other than capital goods purchased not for sale but for use in the business on hand as of December 31, 1987.\n\n3. Secure copy of the inventory list as of December 31, 1987 filed with the revenue district office where it is registered. Claims for transitional input taxes by taxpayers who failed to comply with the provisions of RMC No. 35-87 should be disallowed.\n\n4. Secure copy of audited or interim financial statement, as the case may be, as of December 31, 1987. Reconcile the balances of inventory accounts shown in the balance sheet with the amount appearing in the inventory list and the value of inventory used as basis of the 8% presumptive input tax.\n\n5. In the case of manufacturers, producers or importers, reconcile the balance of the deferred sales tax credit account as reflected in the balance sheet as of December 31, 1987 with the declared amount of excess sales tax credit reported in the percentage tax return for the quarter/period ending December 31, 1987, and if available, the deferred sales tax credit per report of investigation of business tax for the semester ending December 31, 1987.\n\n6. In ascertaining the correct basis of presumptive input tax, exclude the following:\n\n6.1 Items in the inventory which are exempt from sales tax.\n\n6.2 Items in the inventory which are exempt from value-added tax.\n\n6.3 Capital goods including \"supplies and spare parts\" whose estimated lives are greater than one year and are treated as depreciable assets.\n\n6.4 Items in the inventory as of December 31, 1987 where the taxpayer has no legal title such as goods still in transit, goods under consignment, etc.\n\n7. In order to preclude undue claim for presumptive input tax arising from inflated value of inventory as of December 31, 1987, verify the inventories of two or three prior years and compare the value of inventory for such years in relation to the amount of sale. If the amount of inventory suggests that it may have been inflated, verify the accuracy of the list by test-checking sales and purchases of sample items.\n\nIV. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS\n\nThe audit report should be brief and concise but complete in all details necessary to its understanding. It must be accompanied by \u2014\n\n1. Copy of the letter of authority\n\n2. VAT returns for the audited period, together with proofs of payment of VAT\n\n3.

Improvements were not included therein, except in the case of condominiums/townhouses where both land and improvements have been taken into account.\n\nThis Revenue Audit Memorandum Order presents the manner of computation of the tax base of sale, transfer or any disposition of real property including improvements thereon where the zonal value of land has not been established, and at the same time introduces amendments to RAMO 3-87, as follows: cdasia\n\nA. Determination of Tax Base of Sale, Transfer or Any Disposition of Real Property Including Improvements.\n\n1. Computation to determine the tax base of sale, transfer or any disposition of real property including improvements when the zonal value of land has been established:\n\n2. Computation to determine the tax base of sale, transfer or any disposition of real property including improvement when zonal value of land has not yet been established: cdtai\n\n3. a. The following percentages shall be added to the market value of improvement as per classification made by the Provincial/City Assessor appearing in the latest tax declaration:\n\nb. Improvement defined \u2014 is a valuable addition made to property or an amelioration in its condition, amounting to more than mere repairs or replacement of waste, costing labor or capital, and intended to enhance its value, beauty or utility or to adopt it for new or further purposes.\n\n(Chapter I, Section 3 (k) of the Real Property Tax Code).\n\nB. Further Amendments to RAMO 3-87\n\nUnder RAMO 3-87, the percentage of increase in the market value of real property (land and improvement) per latest tax declaration filed with the provincial/city assessor is fixed at 10% or 50%, depending on the location of said real property. For commercial or industrial property and for fishpond, the increase in market value is pegged at a uniform rate of 50% regardless of regional location.\n\nParagraph 2(d) of RAMO 3-87 is amended to read as follows:\n\n(d) If the property is classified as a fishpond, and agricultural land planted to coconut, tobacco, sugar, rice, corn, citrus, and vegetable, the market value of land including improvements shall be increased by fifty (50%) also regardless of regional location.\n\nC. Requirement in the Disposition of Real Property Without any Improvement.\n\nThe disposition of real property without any improvement shall be accompanied by a certification from the Office of Provincial/City Assessor and affidavit by the taxpayer that there is no existing improvement of the real property being sold, transferred or disposed of. cda\n\nEffectivity. \u2014 This Order shall take effect immediately.

                                    "Details": "To insure an effective verification of withholding taxes pursuant to Section 348 of the Tax Code, the following guidelines are hereby prescribed:\n\nI. GENERAL PROVISIONS\n\n1. Scope.\n\nThe audit procedures prescribed herein shall cover creditable withholding taxes on compensation, other amounts payable or paid, final withholding tax on certain income payments, and money payments by government offices. acd\n\n2. Authority.\n\nBeginning with tax year 1985, the audit verification of withholding agents shall be conducted on yearly basis, separate from the regular audit investigation of their direct internal revenue tax liabilities to compel up-to-date compliance with the withholding tax laws and regulations. For this purpose, the letter of authority to be issued by the investigating unit shall cover as much as practicable the year just ended in addition to the unverified prior years.\n\n3. Documents\n\nThe general, records of payments to resident or non-resident payees and financial statements shall be verified to ascertain if \u2014\n\n(a) the income payment is subject to any of the withholding taxes;\n\n(b) the amount of tax withheld or the rate of tax applied is correct; and\n\n(c) the withheld is remitted within the reglementary period.\n\nSpecifically, for withholding tax on:\n\n(a) Compensation (WTC) \u2014 exemption certificates (W-4); payroll records, particularly confidential payrolls, if any, list of employees submitted by the employer to the Social Security System and/or to the Bureau of Labor; employment contracts; information returns (1701 B) for items of compensation not subjected to withholding; supporting vouchers/receipts for advances/reimbursements of transportation and representation expenses; receipts for payment of compensation; and financial statements.\n\n(b) Amounts payable or paid to resident payees (EWT) \u2014 contracts and subcontracts between contractees and prime contractors and between the latter and subcontractors: vouchers, receipts and billings indicating payments to professionals, brokers and sub-brokers, etc., lease agreements; information returns 1701 B and financial statements.\n\n(c) Contracts for payment of certain items of income for the payment (WTS) to resident and non-resident payees of interest, rents, dividends, wages, fees, compensations and gains or profits; central bank approval papers, commercial papers, employment contracts of their employees, contract for payment of royalties, records of prizes or winnings and financial statements.\n\n(d) Money payments by government offices (WTBM) \u2014 contracts, purchase records, payment orders, billing records, receipts, vouchers, cash book and reports of COA auditors.\n\n4. Remittances \u2014\n\nEach of the prescribed monthly and quarterly returns together with confirmation receipts/revenue official receipts (CR/ROR) shall be verified and reconciled with the declarations in the corresponding final returns to ascertain remittance of taxes withheld. cda\n\n5. Registration \u2014\n\nThe examiner should ascertain whether a taxpayer who is required to deduct and withhold taxes, is registered and has been issued an Identification Number (ID). This is the key to monitoring compliance of withholding agents with the withholding tax laws and regulations.\n\nEvery person in control of the payment of an income (office/agency) subject to withholding is required to register within ten days from the time he qualifies as a withholding agent with the Revenue District Office of the city or municipality in which his principal place of business is located. A branch in control of the payment is also required to register independently of the main or central office. A registered withholding agent in a certain revenue district office who transfers to another locality falling within the jurisdiction of another revenue district is likewise required to register anew in the latter district.\n\nUpon verification that the taxpayer is not registered, he shall be required at once to register, and the appropriate penalty imposed.\n\nII. AUDIT REQUIREMENTS \u2014\n\nA. Withholding Tax on Compensation (WTC). \u2014\n\n1. Determine the correctness of the amount of exemption claimed in the certificate of exemption (W-4) per status of employee and qualification and number of dependents (particularly relationships and dates of birth), as well as qualification of employees to the special additional personal exemption, as against the amount of exemption used as the basis of withholding by the employer.\n\nIf the exemptions as verified from the W-4 is less than the exemption indicated in the Alphabetical List of Employees (ALE), make the proper adjustment and compute the correct amount of withholding tax.\n\nEvery employee is required to file an amended W-4 within 10 days from the date of change in his status and/or qualification of dependents, which will either increase or decrease his amount of exemption.\n\n2. Verify the number of employees per payroll records and list of employees submitted to the Social Security System and Bureau of Labor, including casual, emergency and contractual employees and determine if such employees are included in the ALE.\n\nIf verification discloses that an employee is listed in the payroll records, but is not included in the ALE, submit a list indicating the following:\n\na) name and taxpayer account number of employee (TAN)\n\nb) gross compensation;\n\nc) exemption;\n\nd) tax required to be withheld; tax withheld; and tax discrepancy.\n\n3. Reconcile the aggregate gross compensation claimed per income statement with the total amount indicated in the ALE.\n\nIf the amount per income statement exceeds the amount in the ALE, require the withholding agent to submit a list indicating the following:\n\na) name and (TAN) of employee to whom the excess amount is paid;\n\nb) gross compensation including the additional compensation ascertained;\n\nc) exemptions;\n\nd) tax required to be withheld;\n\ne) tax withheld; and\n\nf) discrepancy.\n\nIn general, fixed allowances for transportation and representation expenses are invariably part of taxable compensation income. However, advances or reimbursements for such expenses may be allowed as deductions from compensation, if the following conditions are present: casia\n\na. nature of duties of employee requires the incurring of travelling and representation expenses;\n\nb. the expenses for which the advances/reimbursements are made are ordinary and necessary. Inherent in the terms \"ordinary and necessary\" is the element of reasonableness - they are not lavish or excessive under the circumstances.\n\nc. they are paid or incurred by the employee in the pursuit of the business of the employer - there must be a direct connection between the expenditures and the carrying on of the trade or business of the employer, and such expenditures must be necessary and appropriate to the development and maintenance of business or trade of the employer.\n\nd. the employee is required to account/liquidate the expense by submitting a report and documentary evidence in support of each element of expenditure: (1) amount, (2) time or date it was incurred, (3) place and (4) business purpose.\n\nThe rule on reimbursements/advances applies to automobile expenses such as gasoline, oil, repairs, batteries, insurance, depreciation, interest paid in the purchase of the car, taxes, registration fees, car washes, garage, rent, parking fees and toll fees if the above conditions are satisfied, whether the vehicle is owned by the employer or provided for by the employer the total cost of expenses to the employer shall be the basis for computation.\n\nHowever, the substantiation requirements may be waived in favor of a travelling salesman or field personnel who claims only 70% of the reimbursed/advanced amount received. In the case of other employees required to travel, the option is limited to 30%.\n\nAnother exception to the substantiation rule refers to reasonable amounts of reimbursements/advances for representation and travelling expenses precomputed on daily basis paid to an employee while on special assignment or duty.\n\nIn any case, the excess of reimbursements or advances over substantiated actual expenses shall form part of compensation income.\n\nB. Expanded Withholding Tax. \u2014\n\na) Check amounts payable or paid per income statement and information return (1701B) against those declared in the monthly and annual returns (1743W-1 & 1743B). Submit worksheet for amounts not subjected to withholding, indicating the\n\n1. name and tax account number of payee;\n\n2. nature of income payment;\n\n3. gross amount of payment; and\n\n4. tax required to be withheld.\n\na) Determine the correctness of the rate of withholding tax applied.\n\nb) Determine the correctness of the rate of withholding tax applied.\n\nc) Ascertain payments by and to prime contractors and subcontractors, professionals, brokers, sub-brokers agents of entertainers, etc. cdasia\n\nd) Determine the dates of payment or the period when the obligation to pay the amount subject to withholding is due. The time to withhold is fixed at the time the obligation is due irrespective of the actual payment.\n\nC. Final Withholding Taxes. \u2014\n\n1. Check documents to ascertain the type of income payments, due date of obligation and residence of payee.\n\n2. Ascertain if the income payment was subjected to withholding or not in the year it was accrued, irrespective of whether or not it was actually paid, and whether the taxes withheld were remitted within 10 days following the month in which the payment was accrued. In the case of interest on bank deposits, the remittance shall be made quarterly within 25 days after end of quarter.\n\n3. Determine the correctness of the basis and rate of withholding tax applied.\n\n4. Ascertain date of accrual of the income payment, to fix the time to withhold, irrespective of the actual remittance or nonremittance by reason of official restriction.\n\n5. With respect to interest on bank deposits, reconcile the amount shown on the income statement of the withholding tax return of the payor bank. The excess of the latter amount over the former shall be subjected to withholding unless it is shown to be exempt.\n\nD. Withholding of Business and Miscellaneous Taxes on Money Payments (WTBM).\n\n1. Determine the correctness of bases and rates of tax applied.\n\nThe tax base is the gross amount of money payment undiminished by the amount of income tax withheld under the EWT, or for any other reason. Example: Ministry of Public Highways pays XYZ Co., a contractor, P100,000. \u2014\n\nEWT  \u2014 1% X P100,000 \u2014 P1,000\n\nWTBM  \u2014 .04 X P100,000 \u2014 P4,000\n\n2. Check money payments from vouchers, billing records, record of purchases, COA audit reports, etc. against monthly returns (7.50-1). - submit worksheet indicating:\n\na) name and taxpayer account number of payee;\n\nb) amount of money payment; and\n\nc) date of payment.\n\nIII. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS \u2014\n\n1. Report form ad valorem penalties.\n\nFindings shall be reported in the prescribed forms in duplicate for each of the four types of withholding taxes: WTC-Form No. 1717A-4; EWT-Form No. 1774A-5; WTS-Form No. 1717A-6; and WTBM-Form No. 1717A-7.\n\nThe report shall include the appropriate working papers in support of each item of discrepancy or omission.\n\na) For failure to withhold taxes, impose \u2014\n\n\u2014  either 50% surcharge if failure is due to fraudulent intent or willful neglect or 25% surcharge if failure is not due to such causes.\n\n\u2014  plus 20% interest to be based on the amount of tax required to be withheld from the date the tax is required to be withheld until date of assessment (nil on tax on government money payments). cdt\n\nb) For failure to remit or underremit taxes, or in case of late remittance, impose \u2014\n\n\u2014  either 50% surcharge if failure is due to fraudulent intent or willful neglect; or\n\n\u2014  25% surcharge if it is simple case of late remittance.\n\n\u2014  plus 20% interest from date tax is required to be remitted until it is paid.\n\nc) For failure to file or for late filing of return/statement, impose \u2014\n\n\u2014  either 50% surcharge if the failure is due to fraudulent intent or willful neglect or 25% surcharge if not due to such cause.\n\nIf the withholding agent is a government office or agency, the employee or officer thereof responsible for the withholding and/or remittance of tax shall be personally liable for the surcharges and interest incident to delinquency (Under Executive Order No. 651 , such employee/officer is required to be registered with the Bureau).\n\nd) In addition to the abovementioned ad valorem penalties, a person required to collect, account for, and remit any tax imposed, or who willfully fails to collect such tax, or account for and remit such tax, or willfully assists in any manner to evade any such tax, or the payment thereof, shall be liable to a penalty equal to the amount of the tax not collected, or not accounted for and remitted.\n\n2. If withholding agent or his authorized representative does not entirely conform to findings, the non-agreed portion of the assessment and the reason for non-conformity should be reflected on the space provided for in the report.\n\n3. Reference file. \u2014 A copy of the audit investigation report shall be kept on file by the investigating unit. In the absence of fraud or patently erroneous mathematical computation, such file shall serve as reference in the investigation of the internal tax liabilities of the withholding agent.\n\n4. Guidelines for applying Section 30 (1)\n\n(a) Non-withholding/erroneous withholding.\n\nAn amount claimed as deduction on which a tax is supposed to have been withheld under Sections 52 and 84 shall not be allowed if in the course of audit/investigation, the examiner discovers that:\n\n(1) No withholding of creditable or final tax was made, unless the payee reported the income, and the withholding agent/taxpayer pays during the original audit/investigation, the surcharges, interest and penalties incident to the failure to withhold the tax.\n\n(2) No withholding of creditable or final tax was made and the recipient-payee failed to report the income on due date thereof, unless the withholding agent pays during the original audit/investigation the amount supposed to have been withheld, inclusive of surcharges, interest and penalties incident to his failure to withhold.\n\n(3) The withholding agent erroneously underwithheld the tax, unless he pays during the original audit and investigation the difference in the amount supposed to have been withheld, inclusive of surcharges, interest and penalties incident to such error. cdtai\n\n(b) Non/late remittance.\n\nIf, in the course of original audit/investigation, it should be discovered that the tax withheld on an amount claimed as deduction, has not been paid by withholding agent/taxpayer, the deduction shall not be allowed, unless it is shown that the non remittance is not due to fraudulent intent or willful neglect, and that the withholding agent/taxpayer pays the unremitted tax, surcharge, interest and the penalty equivalent to the amount of the tax not remitted or under-remitted.\n\nThis order shall take effect immediately.\n\n(SGD.)

                                    "Details": "1. BACKGROUND\n\n1.1 Some branches of foreign corporations engage in business in the Philippines by soliciting orders from local importers. These branches are called \"liaison offices or branches.\" Sales made from such solicitations are not reported by these branches as their own sales purportedly because the branch office merely relays to its head office abroad purchase orders from local importers and it is purportedly its head office that actually consummates the sales. At the end of the taxable period, the branch office simply reports for income tax purposes its purported share of the income generated from sales but the allocation of this purported share is left entirely at the discretion of its head office. The revenue service is completely at the mercy of multi-national companies. cda\n\n1.2 Some branches engage in business in the Philippines by soliciting orders from local importers and relays this information to its head office abroad. The head office in turn solicits prospective exporters for a compensation. At the end of the taxable period, the head office allocates a certain portion of the compensation to its branch in the Philippines. The branch in turn reports its purported share for income tax purposes but does not pay the commercial broker's tax thereon purportedly because the compensation was received from its head office and purportedly because the branch cannot be legally considered a commercial broker in relation to its head office since the branch and its head office possess only a single legal personality (PHILIPP BROTHERS OCEANIC, INC. vs. COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, CTA Case No. 3140, March 8, 1984).\n\nAgain, in this second situation, allocation of the compensation is left at the discretion of the head office \u2014 the revenue service also left at the mercy of these multi-national companies.\n\n2. LEGAL CONSEQUENCES\n\n2.1 The foregoing scope of activities of these branch offices is considered under R.A. 5455 as business acts. \"'Doing business' shall include soliciting orders, purchases, service contracts opening offices, whether called 'liaison' offices or branches. . . . any other act or acts that imply a continuity of commercial dealings or arrangements, and contemplate to that extent the performance of acts or works, or the exercise of some of the functions normally incident to, and in progressive prosecution of, commercial gain or of the purpose and object of the business organization.\" (SEC. 1 (1), R.A. 5455).\n\n2.2 These branch offices, like any other businesses, are required by law to account for their business operations in accordance with generally accepted accounting practices (SEC. 38, NIRC). Thus, a branch office although not possessing a separate and distinct juridical personality is, however, considered under generally accepted accounting practices as a distinct character, a separate business unit and should be \"supplied by the home office with cash and merchandise and such other assets as may be needed\" (Advance Accounting by Simons and Karrenbrock, 4th ed., p. 202). Generally accepted accounting practices also dictate that income and expenses of the branch shall be segregated from those of the home office in order to clearly reflect their respective operating results (ibid). cdasia\n\n2.3 The doctrine on corporate fiction is not absolute - the veil of corporate fiction may be legally pierced should it be used to subvert just application of laws.\n\n\". . . Where the corporate form or organization is adopted or a corporate entity is asserted in an endeavor to evade a statute or to modify its intent, courts will disregard the corporation or its entity. This has been applied to violations of . . . tax laws, . . .\" (FLETCHER, 170-171, Commentaries and Jurisprudence on the Commercial Laws of the Philippines by Agbayani, Vol. 3, 1970 ed., p. 21).\n\n\". . . Where a corporation is a dummy, is unreal or a sham and serves no business purposes and is intended only as a blind, the corporate form may be ignored for the law cannot countenance a form that is bald and a mischievous fiction.\" (LIDDEL & CO. v. COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE, L-9687, June 30, 1961, citing Gregory v. Helvering, 293 US 465, L. ed. 596-599; Higgins v. Smith, 1940, 308 US 406 L. ed., cited in p. 20, Commentaries and Jurisprudence on the Commercial Laws of the Philippines by Agbayani, Vol. 3, 1970 ed.).\n\n\". . . To allow a taxpayer to deny tax liability on the ground that the sales were made through another and distinct corporation when it is proved that the latter is virtually owned by the former or that they are practically one and the same is to sanction a circumvention of our tax laws.\" (ibid).\n\nCorporate fiction may be inquired upon where there is \"inadequacy of capital . . ., confusion of affairs . . . and direct intervention in management causing inequitable results (Ballantine, 314; Rorhlick, 417-422).\n\n3. BRANCH OPERATION AND CONSEQUENCES\n\n3.1 The Philippine branch solicits purchase orders from local buyers, relays the information to its home office abroad, and the home office purportedly directly makes the sale.\n\nIn this type of operation: (i) Sales purportedly consummated abroad by the home office shall be treated as sales constructively consummated in the Philippines and made by the branch office, hence, income therefrom shall be considered income from sources within the Philippines; (ii) the branch shall record and report the gross selling price of commodities sold thru its home office; and (iii) report for income tax purposes its net income therefrom. (iv) Since under this situation, the import taxes, duties and charges have already been paid by the local buyers, the same shall not anymore be chargeable against the branch.\n\nUnder this paragraph, these transactions are treated sales constructively consummated by the branch office in accordance with generally accepted accounting practices required under Section 38 of the Tax Code since the branch solicitations are actually trading acts. Accordingly, the home office is obligated to supply its branch with merchandise in pursuing its trading business in the Philippines. Hence, sales purportedly made directly by its home office shall be considered no more than merely a constructive supplying of the merchandise to its branch which eventually constructively sells the same to Philippine buyers. cdasia\n\n3.2 The branch solicits purchase orders from local buyers, relays the information to its home office, the home office solicits prospective sellers abroad and eventually receives compensation for services rendered.\n\nIn this second type of operation: (i) the branch shall be considered \"a commercial broker\" or indentor; (ii) its share from compensation as allocated by its home office shall be subject to commercial broker gross receipts tax; (iii) the branch shall provide itself with the corresponding fixed tax as a commercial broker; and (iv) pay income tax on its share of the compensation.\n\nUnder this paragraph, the branch office shall be considered a commercial broker since its activities is well within the ambit of the term \"broker\". Brokers are \". . . those who are engaged for others in the negotiation of contracts relative to property with the custody of which they have no concern. They act as negotiators in bringing other persons together to bargain; generally, they ought not to sell in their own names, have no implied authority to receive payment, are not entrusted with the physical possession of the principal's goods when engaged to buy or sell, and have no special property therein or lien thereon.\" (8 Am. Jur. 889-890, cited in Philipp Brothers Oceanic, Inc. v. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue, CTA Case No. 3140, March 8, 1984).\n\n4. AUDIT PROCEDURE\n\n4.1 For constructive trading by branch office\n\n(a) Determine gross sales generated from branch's constructive trading (from solicitations made by the branch);\n\n(b) Require the Philippine branch to submit duly authenticated (i) income statement; and (ii) statement of cost of sales re worldwide operation of the entire corporation during the taxable year;\n\n(c) Extract the gross income generated from such constructive sales by applying against the gross constructive sales the gross profit rate shown in the cost of sale statement referred to in paragraph (b) (ii) above.\n\nIllustration: Assume that the gross profit ratio, based on worldwide statement of cost of sales, is 20% and the gross constructive sales amounts to P1,000,000. Gross income therefrom shall be computed as follows:\n\n(d) Check from the records of the Bureau of Customs all shipments coming from the branch's home office during the taxable year in determining the branch's constructive sales in the Philippines. cdasia\n\n(e) Require the branch to reconcile computations of its constructive sales in the Philippines.\n\n4.2 For broker activity by branch office\n\n(a) Verify veracity of the amount of compensation allocated to the branch by its home office;\n\n(b) Require submission of sworn declaration from home office on the correctness of the allocated share of the branch office and cross check this declaration in connection with the branch records re extent of solicitations undertaken in the Philippines during the tax year;\n\n(c) Require the branch to pay the corresponding fixed tax as a commercial broker;\n\n(d) Require the branch to pay the corresponding commercial broker's gross receipts tax, based on its total share from compensation derived for services rendered in the Philippines; and\n\n(e) Determine also the branch income tax obligation for the said income which is being considered income from sources within the Philippines.\n\n5. IMPLEMENTATION\n\nStrict enforcement of this Revenue Audit Memorandum Order is enjoined.\n\n6. EFFECTIVITY\n\nThis Order shall take effect immediately. cdt\n\n7. PUBLICATION\n\nThe Bureau shall give this Order as wide a publicity as possible for proper guidance of multi-national companies doing business in the Philippines under a branch-head office relationship; and for strict enforcement by revenue personnel.\n\n(SGD.)

Background\n\n1.1 In computing net income from sources within the Philippines, Section 37(b) provides that from the gross income from sources within the Philippines \". . . there shall be deducted the expenses, losses and other deductions properly allocated thereto and a ratable part of any expenses, interests and losses and other deductions effectively connected with the business or trade conducted exclusively within the Philippines which cannot be definitely allocated to some items or class of gross income . . . \" casia\n\n1.2 These deductions are difficult to verify because substantial amounts thereof are incurred in the head office or elsewhere and the corresponding supporting documents and books of accounts are not accessible to local taxing authorities.\n\n1.3 Heretofore only an audit certificate is presented to substantiate the deductions incurred abroad which are allocated and pro-rated to Philippine source gross income.\n\n1.4 In implementing the above provision of the National Internal Revenue Code, there is a need for adequate and satisfactory proof and explanations in order that the claimed deductions of the foreign taxpayer may be allowed for income tax purposes.\n\n2. Audit Procedure\n\n2.1 Functional analysis \u2014 At the start of investigation there should be a detailed examination of the functions performed both by the Home Office and the Local Branch. For this purpose, an organization and functional chart of the home office and local branch should be secured.\n\n2.11 The functions should be determined and then listed. Who does what? What is required to do it? Who needs whom for what?\n\n2.12 After having listed the functions performed by each entity, the functions themselves must be analyzed. Could anyone else perform these functions? How difficult are they? What skill, equipment and processes are needed? cd i\n\n2.2 On the basis of the functional analysis, the claimed deduction properly allocable can now be determined by applying the tests of (a) relevance (necessary) to the local branch and (b) reasonable (ordinary) charges keeping always in mind the arm's length principle in transactions between related parties.\n\n2.3 As to the deductions which cannot be definitely allocated, the following are required:\n\n2.31 Breakdown or Schedule of Home or Foreign Office expenses being pro-rated, together with an explanation of the nature of each expense. Take note of deductions which are directly allocable to income earned outside the Philippines.\n\n2.32 Basis of pro-ration \u2014 (a) Determine if the basis and method of pro-ration are being applied consistently from year to year. (b) Is the same amount of Home Office expenses being allocated world-wide?\n\n3. In all instances, be on the lookout for:\n\na. Charges applicable to newly opened foreign branches but are being claimed as deductions by the Philippine branch;\n\nb. Functions are being performed for some branches but not for others, and yet no adjustments are made on the allocation;\n\nc. or any other scheme of over-allocating costs to the Philippine branch. cdasia\n\n4. All pertinent provisions of these Audit Guidelines applicable in the investigations of subsidiaries by multi-national companies should be observed by all internal revenue officers concerned.\n\n(SGD.)

                                    "Details": "1. Background\n\n1.1 It has been observed that in the audit of OBUs and FCDUs, some examiners are treating fees, commissions and other charges which are integral parts of the onshore interest income derived by OBUs and FCDUs from foreign currency loan transactions as other income subject to the normal corporate income tax; casia\n\n1.2 In order to clarify the proper tax treatment of such items in the light of the law and regulations, this Revenue Audit Memorandum Order is hereby promulgated.\n\n2. The Law and the Regulations\n\n2.1 Under Section 7 of PD 1034 and Section 2 of PD 1035 , net offshore income derived by OBUs and FCDUs were subject to tax at the rate of 5% which tax is in lieu of all taxes, except net income from such transactions as may be specified by the Minister of Finance, upon recommendation of the Monetary Board, to be subject to the usual income tax payable by banks. Beginning January 14, 1981, net offshore income derived by OBUs and FCDUs from foreign currency transactions are exempted from income tax under Section 24(f) of the Tax Code. (PD 1773 ). Gross onshore income derived by the same units are subject only to the 10% final withholding tax. acd\n\n2.2 Section 2(h) and 3(b) of Revenue Regulations No. 10-76, as amended by Revenue Regulations 14-77, provides that gross (onshore) interest income \"shall not include any and all fees, commissions and other charges which are integral parts of the income from the above (foreign currency loan) transaction.\" In other words, \"any and all fees, commissions, and other charges which are integral parts of the charges imposed on foreign currency loan transactions are exempt from the tax herein imposed.\"\n\n3. Treatment of the Excluded or Exempt Gross Onshore Income\n\n3.1 The exclusion from gross onshore income (which is subject to the 10% final withholding tax) of the said \"fees, commissions, and other charges which are integral parts of the interest income\" derived by an OBU or FCDU from foreign currency loan transactions does not justify their treatment as net income taxable under Section 24(a) of the Tax Code which imposes the normal income tax on net income at the rate of 25%-35%. In a memorandum to the Minister of Finance dated November 11, 1977, the Acting Commissioner of Internal Revenue in explaining the reason for amending Revenue Regulations No. 10-76 by Revenue Regulations No. 14-77, stated: acd\n\n\"We have, after due deliberation, opted to exempt from all taxes, commissions, and fees and other charges which form integral part of the charges imposed on foreign loan transactions as this would be more in consonance with our policy of favoring foreign currency transactions of OBUs and FCDUs.\n\n3.2 Moreover, to treat the gross onshore income items which are expressly excluded for purposes of the 10% final withholding tax as taxable under Section 24(a) of the Tax Code will result in taxation of \"net income from such transactions as may be specified by the Minister of Finance, upon recommendation of the Monetary Board.\" Considering that the Minister of Finance has not yet specified, much less the Monetary Board has not recommended, what items of net income derived by OBUs and FCDUs are \"subject to the usual income tax payable by banks,\" the said commissions and fees and other charges which were excluded by Sections 2(h) and 3(b) of Revenue Regulations No. 10-77, as amended by Revenue Regulations No. 14-77, are exempt from all taxes, including the normal corporate income tax of 25%-35% payable by banks.\n\n4. Applicability\n\nThis Revenue Audit Memorandum Order shall be applicable to OBUs and FCDUs, the tax liabilities of which are subject to audit for the taxable years beginning 1977. casia\n\nRUBEN B.

Examination and inspection . . . shall be done in the taxpayer's office or place of business or in the office of the BIR . . .\";\n\n1.12 Section 20 of the Bookkeeping Regulations (Rev. Reg. No. V-1) which provides that \". . . All books, registers and other records, and vouchers and other supporting papers required by these regulations shall be kept at all times at the place of business of the taxpayer, subject to inspection of any internal revenue officer, and upon demand, the same must be immediately produced and submitted for inspection.\"\n\n1.2 In order to deal more effectively with taxpayers who refuse to cooperate, the following audit procedures shall be followed. cd\n\n2. Audit Procedure\n\n2.1 The Revenue Examiner shall request the taxpayer, in writing, to make available for inspection, the pertinent books of accounts, accounting records and particular or specific documents indicating therein the time and date within which these records should be made available.\n\n2.2 The duplicate copy of this written request, duly acknowledged/received by the taxpayer or his authorized representative shall form part of the docket of the case.\n\n2.3 If on the appointed time and date the requested records and/or documents are not presented, an explanation for such delay shall be sought and the Examiner shall again request in writing as to when he wants the records definitely presented, a date which should be reasonable enough in order not to prejudice the government interest.\n\n2.4 If the taxpayer fails further to present the required records at subsequent appointed date, the Examiner should request an explanation in writing to be signed by the taxpayer or his authorized representative as to why the desired records are not still available. aisa dc\n\n2.5 Memorandum of Interview \u2014\n\n2.51 During all the stages of the above proceedings a memorandum of interview (an informal note or instrument embodying something that a person desires to fix in memory by the aid of written word) must be promptly prepared, signed and dated by the Examiner, indicating therein the date, time, place and persons present as well as what transpired.\n\n2.52 Since the memorandum of interview may be used in the event of a trial, the Examiner should confine the memoranda to the facts developed in the interview, and should avoid opinions, conclusions and other extraneous matters.\n\n2.6 The Examiner in consultation with his supervisory officials shall then submit a written report, pinpointing the particular records not made available to him, the responsible officers liable, and the facts relating to the unnecessary and/or unreasonable delay in his investigation. cdt\n\n3. Transfer of the Case to the Legal Office\n\n3.1 The Division Chief or Revenue District Officer shall then forward the case to the Chief, Prosecution Division or Chief, Legal Branch, as the case may be, for issuance of the Subpoena Duces Tecum or filing the case in court if warranted under the circumstances.\n\n3.2 If a Subpoena Duces Tecum is issued and the taxpayer complies to its terms, these records shall be referred back to the assessing unit for continuation of the delayed investigation. cda\n\nRUBEN B.

Kinds of Shares of Stocks\n\nThere are three kinds of shares of stocks that present problems of valuation for purposes of transfer taxes, to wit:\n\n1. Common shares of stock which are quoted or traded in the stock market.\n\n2. Unlisted stock or those which are not quoted or traded in the stock market.\n\n3. Preferred shares of stocks.\n\nB. Basis of Valuation of Shares of Stocks\n\n1. Stocks quoted or traded in the stock market \u2014\n\nIn the case of shares of stocks which are quoted or traded in the stock exchange or in an over-the-counter market or otherwise, the following rules of valuation shall be observed:\n\na) The selling price shall be used where there are sales made on the valuation date. The mean between the highest and lowest selling prices on valuation dates shall be the fair market value per share. cdasia\n\nb) If there were no sales on the valuation date, but there were sales on dates within a reasonable period both before and after the valuation date, the fair market value is determined by taking the weighted average of the mean between the highest and lowest sales on the nearest trading date before and the nearest trading date after the valuation date. The average is to be weighted inversely by the respective number of trading days between the selling dates and the valuation date.\n\nThe reasonable period of valuation must not exceed six months before or after the valuation date.\n\nFor example:\n\nThe valuation date is January 15, Friday. Sales of stock occurred on January 13, Wednesday or two trading days before valuation date at P10.00 and on Wednesday, January 20, three days after valuation date at P15.00. The fair market value of the shares to be taken is P12.00 computed as follows: cd\n\nc) If actual sales of the shares are not available during a reasonable period beginning before and ending after the valuation date, the fair market value may be determined by taking the mean between the bonafide bid and asked prices on the valuation date, or if none, by taking the weighted average of the mean between the bonafide bid and asked prices on the nearest trading date before and after the valuation date within a reasonable period in accordance with the formula in the preceding paragraph.\n\nd) If there are no sales or bonafide bid and asked prices available on a date within a reasonable period before the valuation date, but such prices are available on a date within a reasonable period after the valuation date, or vice versa, then the mean between the highest and lowest available sale prices or bid and asked prices nearest the valuation date may be taken as the value of the shares. cda\n\ne) If it is established that the selling or bid and asked prices as provided in the foregoing paragraphs, do not reflect the fair market value thereof, some reasonable modification of that basis or other relevant facts and element of value may be considered. In certain exceptional cases, the size of the block of the stock to be valued in relation to the number of shares changing hands in sales may affect adversely the fair market value of the stocks to be valued.\n\n2. Unlisted stocks or stocks not quoted or traded in the stock market \u2014\n\nIn the valuation of unlisted stocks or stocks of closely held corporations, the following rules shall be observed:\n\na) In general, the unlisted shares shall be valued at their book value nearest the valuation date. The book value of these unlisted shares of stock shall be prima facie considered as their fair market value. cd\n\nb) In case the shares are valued on a basis lower than their book values, a justification for the deviation from the book value, together with the evidences in support thereof, should be submitted. The following factors are considered relevant in the valuation of shares of stock of closed corporations.\n\n1) The nature of the business and the financial history of the enterprise, from the date of incorporation\n\n2) The economic outlook in general and the business condition and outcome of the specific industry in particular\n\n3) The financial condition of the business\n\n4) The earning capacity of the company\n\n5) The dividend paying capacity\n\n6) Goodwill\n\n7) Sales of stocks and size of the block of stock to be valued cdtai\n\n8) Market price of stocks of corporations engaged in the same or similar line of business to be valued\n\n9) Existence of corporate debts in favor of the family of the principal shareholder\n\n10) Restrictive agreements impairing the alienability of the stock\n\n11) Investments in business or property maintained at a deficit\n\n12) Dividend arrearages\n\n13) Voting rights of stockholders\n\n14) Difficulty in liquidating the assets\n\nIf such lower fair market valuation is not clearly established and documented, the book value of the unlisted shares of stock shall be adopted. If there have been previous bonafide sales/exchanges of the unlisted shares of stock, the price at which these shares exchanged hands should be taken/considered as its fair market value/s. cdtai\n\n3. Preferred shares of stocks shall always be valued at par \u2014\n\nAll concerned are enjoined to strictly observe the foregoing guidelines in the valuation of shares of stocks for transfer tax purposes.\n\nRUBEN B.

                                    "Details": "A. BACKGROUND.\n\n1. It has been observed that reports of investigation of cases are referred back to the examiner for reinvestigation upon request of a taxpayer who disagrees with the deficiency assessment. A contested assessment arises from a disagreement on facts as reported by the examiner or differences in the application of a particular provision of law or regulation. cd i\n\n2. In order to minimize reinvestigation of internal revenue tax cases already reported by the examiners, the facts as found by the examiners should be definitely established in the report . To attain this objective, it is necessary to crystallize the arguments of both the taxpayer and the examiner on factual and legal issues involved in the discrepancies which are used as basis for a deficiency tax determination. This will also facilitate final administrative decision on any issue involved in a contested deficiency tax assessment recommended by the investigating examiner. cda\n\nB. PRE-AUDIT PROCEDURES.\n\n1. In order to enhance the adequacy of the scope of audit to be undertaken by an examiner in investigating a tax return or case assigned to him, the chief of section or group supervisor, as the case may be, shall formulate a checklist of audit procedures. Although a checklist of audit procedures may be standardized for application to similar cases, the section chief/group supervisor, jointly with the division chief/revenue district officer, should endeavor to devise a checklist of special audit procedures which shall be undertaken in auditing or investigating each tax case.\n\n2. A copy of the checklist should be attached to the examiner's report as one of the bases for audit-reviewing the report of investigation. Although it is impractical to make rigid rules covering the arrangement and content of all working papers, the same should be standardized as to size and type of paper, indexing, cross referencing, binding and general arrangement of data. cdtai\n\n3. In addition to the foregoing, the section chief/group supervisor must thoroughly evaluate each income tax return before assigning it to an examiner. Each section chief/group supervisor shall prepare a list of items to be verified by examiners. The list shall be known as Pre-Examination List and shall be attached to the return. The examiner shall comment on all items listed in the pre-examination list in his audit report.\n\n4. Investigation procedures should not, of course, be confined to the items listed for verification. The examiner should exercise his judgment, skill and discretion in extending the scope of his audit, not only to any item appearing in the return and statements attached thereto, but also to areas which can potentially lead to an assessment and/or collection of deficiency tax.\n\nC. ADDITIONAL REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.\n\n1. In cases where the taxpayer does not agree with the findings and recommendations of the examiner, whether the issues involved are questions of fact or questions of law, the examiner must request the taxpayer to submit a memorandum, specifying his objections to the examiner's findings. cda\n\n2. The examiner should thoroughly evaluate the taxpayer's arguments or objections and may require additional proof to substantiate the taxpayer's arguments. If it is necessary to defer a partially completed audit to allow the taxpayer time to secure additional information, a memo should be prepared in duplicate outlining the work to be done by the taxpayer and the approximate date of the resumption of the audit. Whenever completion of an examination is deferred to accommodate a taxpayer, the examiner should secure a \"Waiver of Prescription\"\n\n3. If the examiner does not agree with the taxpayer's contention, he should discuss in detail his reasons for reiterating his findings and must refute every argument presented by the taxpayer in a separate memorandum which will form part of his audit report.\n\n4. Where the taxpayer agrees to the findings of the examiner, the latter shall require the taxpayer to sign the agreement form. The agreement form shall indicate the deficiency tax due from the taxpayer as well as the increments thereto arising from the deficiency assessment. aisa dc\n\nD. AUDIT REVIEW-LEVEL.\n\n1. In all cases where the taxpayer does not agree with the findings and recommendations of the examiner, the taxpayer should be given further opportunity to present his side of the case. A preliminary ten-day letter should be prepared, informing the taxpayer of the proposed assessment. The preliminary ten-day letter, if feasible, should contain the reasons for the discrepancies as discussed by the examiner in his memorandum. If it is not practicable to incorporate the examiner's arguments in the preliminary ten-day letter, a copy of the examiner's memorandum should be enclosed with the preliminary ten-day letter to the taxpayer. The taxpayer should not be allowed to examine the working papers which contain the examiner's comments having no direct bearing on the audit computations. This is especially true of comments which express the auditor's opinion drawn from the facts as he understands them. Examiners should never under any circumstances allow a taxpayer to read comments of a confidential nature. cdt\n\n2. The taxpayer should be requested to submit his reply within the ten-day period from receipt thereof. If no reply is received within the ten-day period, formal assessment should be prepared.\n\n3. If the taxpayer answers within the ten-day period, a thorough evaluation of his arguments should be made to determine whether or not the examiner has taken into account all the facts and circumstances of each contested item of discrepancy and to determine whether the examiner exercised good judgment in making his recommendations.\n\n4. If, upon audit review, the examiner's findings are found justified, a formal assessment notice containing the recommended deficiency assessment should be prepared.\n\n5. If, in the light of the taxpayer's reply to the preliminary ten-day letter, the evidence to support the examiner's findings and recommendations appears inadequate, the report of investigation should be returned to the examiner for further reinvestigation. The examiner should prepare a memorandum embodying his comments and recommendations. If there are changes in his recommended assessments, he should prepare new Examiner's Report Form No. 17.17 C and 17.17 D and explain fully the causes for the change. cdt\n\nIf the issue involves a difficult and doubtful question of law, the report should be forwarded to the Legal Office for advice and opinion.\n\n6. In cases where the report of examination is accompanied by the Agreement Form duly accomplished and signed by the taxpayer, the Audit Review Division concerned or Assessment Branch, as the case may be, shall issue the assessment notice without the preliminary ten-day letter if it finds no additional discrepancy in its review of the cases. This usually closes the case. The case will not be reopened to make an adjustment unfavorable to the taxpayer, unless there is evidence of fraud, malfeasance, collusion, concealment or material misrepresentation and/or there was substantial error based on an established Internal Revenue Regulations existing at the time of the previous examination.\n\n7. In cases where records are incomplete or non-existent, it will be necessary to estimate the tax liability based upon the most reliable information the examiner can obtain. In these instances, the comments should be complete and should indicate clearly the method used in estimating the tax liability, the particular method used in preference to some other, and any additional factors tending to confirm the correctness of the examiner's estimate of the tax liability. cdt\n\nE. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION FACTOR.\n\nCompliance or noncompliance with the additional reporting requirement shall be taken into account in evaluating the examiner's performance under RMO No. 14-81.\n\nF. EFFECTIVITY .\n\nThis Audit Memorandum Order shall take effect beginning with reports of investigation submitted on or after September 1, 1981. cdt\n\nROMULO M. VILLA\nActing Commissioner",

NATURE OF CLAIMS AGAINST ESTATE.\n\nThe word \"claims\" as used in the statute is generally construed to mean debts or demands of a pecuniary nature which could have been enforced against the deceased in his lifetime and could have been reduced to simple money judgments. Claims against the estate or indebtedness in respect of property may arise out of: aisa dc\n\n1. Contract\n\n2. Tort\n\n3. Operation of law\n\nB. PURPOSE OF VERIFICATION.\n\nThe determination as to whether a claim against the estate is an allowable deduction involves a proper appreciation of evidence in order that the examiner may fully satisfy himself and the Bureau that:\n\n1. The liability represents a personal obligation of the deceased existing at the time of his death;\n\n2. The liability was contracted bona fide and for an adequate and full consideration in money or money's worth;\n\n3. That the claim is a debt or charge which is valid in law and enforceable against the estate of the deceased. cdtai\n\nC. AUDIT PROCEDURES.\n\nIn the verification of claims against the estate for transfer tax purposes, the following audit procedures must be observed:\n\n1. Documentation. \u2014 The following documents must be scrutinized and certified true copies thereof submitted with the report.\n\na) The promissory note or contract of loan signed by the debtor.\n\nb) In the case of advances made by individuals or corporations to the deceased, copies of vouchers, cancelled checks or other documents evidencing the advances. cdtai\n\nc) Other documents or evidences relevant to the grant of the loan, i.e. real estate or chattel mortgage, a copy of the Certificate or Title to show annotations thereof, etc.\n\nd) Certification under oath by the creditor for the exact balance of the liability including accrued interest at the time of death, except balances of bank loans where a mere certification (not under oath) is sufficient, provided that the investigating examiner confirms that it was actually issued by an authorized officer of the bank.\n\ne) Where the settlement is made thru the Court in a testate or intestate proceeding, pertinent documents filed with the Court evidencing claims against the estate, or the Court order approving the said claims if already issued.\n\n2. Verification. \u2014\n\na) The financial capacity of the creditor to lend the amount; aisa dc\n\nb) The purpose for which the amount was borrowed and if any portion thereof remained unspent at the time of death;\n\nc) If the loan was used for investment or for the purchase of an asset, if the asset is included as part of the gross estate;\n\nd) The relationship between the creditor and debtor to determine whether or not the loan was the result of an arms-length transaction;\n\ne) Comparison of the signature of the deceased on the promissory note with that on another authentic document to determine the genuineness thereof;\n\nf) In the case of a business credit, in addition to the foregoing procedures, the examiner should check, if feasible, whether the liability was recorded in the books of accounts and balance sheet of the creditor; cdtai\n\ng) Where the decedent has a co-maker in the instrument of loan, whether or not the whole proceeds thereof was actually received by the decedent.\n\nRUBEN B.
