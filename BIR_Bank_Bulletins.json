CAIHTE\n\n(SGD.) ROMEO D. LUMAGUI, JR.\nCommissioner of Internal Revenue\n\nATTACHMENT\n\nAuthorized Agent Bank Teller's Guide\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nThe implementation of Executive Order No. 937, issued on March 1, 1984, through the issuance of Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 5-84 dated May 29, 1984, vesting in the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) the primary responsibility of enforcing the collection of national revenue internal taxes though the Banking System. On January 5, 2024, the Ease of Paying Taxes (EOPT) Act or RA 11976 was signed into law by President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. The act aims to incentivize taxpayer compliance by simplifying procedures and reducing burdens, consequently boosting government revenue collection.\n\nUnder the EOPT Act, taxpayers are required to file their tax returns electronically and pay their taxes due thereon through the Authorized Agent Banks (AABs) via Over-The-Counter (OTC) payment, Electronic Filing and Payment System (eFPS) and other BIR ePayment gateways, such as, but not limited to:\n\na) Development Bank of the Philippines' (DBP) Pay Tax Online \u2014 for holders of Visa/Mastercard; Credit Card and/or BancNet ATM/Debit Card;\n\nb) LandBank of the Philippines (LBP) Link.Bbiz Portal \u2014 for taxpayers who have ATM account with LBP and/or holders of BancNet ATM/Debit/Prepaid Card and taxpayer utilizing PCHC PayGate or PESONet facility \u2014 for depositors of RCBC, Robinsons Bank, Union Bank, BPI, PSBank and Asia United Bank;\n\nc) Union Bank's Online/The Portal Payment Facility \u2014 for taxpayers who have an account with Union Bank of the Philippines or Instapay via UPAY \u2014 for individual Non-Union Bank account holders; or\n\nd) Tax Software Provider/Taxpayer Agent \u2014 Maya/MyEG.\n\nMoreover, AABs accept tax returns and its corresponding payment due thereon through OTC in accordance with the rules, policies and regulations set-forth in the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) among the BIR, the Bureau of Treasury (BTr) and the concerned banks, as well as the BIR relevant issuances.\n\nThis partnership continues, as the Banks agrees that acceptance of internal revenue taxes through OTC payment is part of their strategy to offer various banking services to their customers and provides additional payment channel option to taxpayers. Though, the BIR and the AAB continues to encourage online tax payments and making its services seamless, AABs still need to have their OTC collecting bank branches open to accept payments for back-up purposes, especially during BIR tax deadlines. aScITE\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nThe aim of the AAB Teller's Guide is to provide a reference guide for the bank tellers who are tasked to perform activities that are related to collection as one of the BIR's core functions.

DETACa\n\nLikewise, all AABs are advised on the following procedures in the processing of out-of-district returns and payment of taxes due thereon:\n\n1. Receive from the taxpayers in triplicate copies the printed copies of electronically filed returns tax returns/payment forms thru eBIRForms, necessary attachments thereto, if any, and the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR)-Bureau of the Treasury (BTr) deposit/payment slip.\n\nA BIR-BTr deposit/payment slip shall have transaction date, name and Tax Identification Number (TIN) of taxpayers, BTr-BIR account number, account name which is BTr-BIR, name of the drawee bank and check number (for check payment), bank debit advice number (for debit system payment), and the amount of tax to be paid. Said deposit/payment slip shall be accomplished and issued in triplicate copies, distributed as follows:\n\na. Original (taxpayer's copy)\n\nb. Duplicate (AAB's copy)\n\nc. Triplicate (to be attached to the tax return/payment form)\n\n2. Check the completeness of presented tax return/payment form, as well as the attached accomplished deposit/payment slip.\n\n3. Stamp \"RECEIVED\" and \"Out-of-District\" on the three (3) copies of tax return/payment form.\n\nNotes:\n\na. The attachments to the Annual Income Tax Return (AITR) shall be stamped only on the page of the Audit Certificate, the Balance Sheet and the Income Statement. The other pages of the financial statements and its attachments need not be stamped \"RECEIVED.\" In case of corporations and other juridical persons, a maximum of two (2) extra copies of the audited financial statements for filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission should be stamped \"RECEIVED.\" HEITAD\n\nb. For acceptance of late payments, AABs shall accept the late filing tax returns stamped with the qualifier \"LATE FILING\" and supported by computation of the corresponding penalties by the concerned RDO/LTDO/LT Division. AABs shall stamp \"FILED LATE\" on the tax return/payment form and \"INCREMENTS NOT PAID\" if the additional penalties/fees are not paid by the taxpayers.\n\n4. Accept tax payment and machine validate the BIR-prescribed deposit/payment slip accomplished by the taxpayer as evidence that the BIR tax payment was deposited to the account of the BTr. The machine validation must reflect on the BIR deposit/payment slip the date of payment, amount paid, transaction number, the name of the bank, branch code, teller's code and teller's initials.\n\n5. Release to the taxpayer the duly stamped \"RECEIVED\" triplicate copy of tax return/payment form and the original copy of the machine validated deposit/payment slip.\n\n6. Post the tax payment collected, using the online tellering system, by crediting the BTr demand deposit account in the AAB head office.\n\n7. Batch separately the out-of-district returns from the tax returns received under the jurisdiction of the Host RDO.\n\nIn cases where the AABs are using their own BIR-approved tellering system in the encoding of payment details and generation of BCS, which cannot provide a separate BCS for out-of-district tax return/payment form, AABs shall manually indicate \"Out-of-District\" beside the item number of the corresponding tax payment information listed in the BCS prior to submission to the concerned Host RDO.\n\n8. Encode the tax payment information into the Limited Bank Data Entry System (LBDES) or Bank System indicating the RDO Number of the accepting AAB branches in the required field of the LBDES or Bank System, instead of the RDO Number where the taxpayer is registered.\n\nNote: Information details for cash payments shall consist of the date of transaction, name of taxpayer, TIN-Branch Code of taxpayer, form type, tax type, return period, amount of tax paid. For check payments, name of the drawee bank, check number and issue date shall be included.\n\n9. Report all daily collections to respective Head Offices, for subsequent remittance to the BTr following the existing policies and procedures.\n\n10. Accept out-of-district tax return/payment form with payments from taxpayers paying thru checks with different collecting AAB branch name indicated on the face of the check, provided that the payment is made through other branches of the same AAB. However, taxpayers shall indicate at the back of the check the name of the receiving AAB branch. aDSIHc\n\nMoreover, accept check payment even without the name of receiving AAB branch, TIN and name of taxpayer indicated in the face of the check, provided that all check payments shall be made payable to the \"Bureau of Internal Revenue\" and the AAB shall require the taxpayers to write legibly the name of the receiving branch, TIN and name of taxpayer at the back of the check.\n\nFurther, all AABs are reminded on the following:\n\n1. Accept the tax payments from taxpayers who are already within the bank's premises by the close of the AAB banking hours.\n\n2. Accept check payments even after the bank clearing cut-off time and stamp the tax return/payment form \"Received after cut-off/clearing time\" or with similar stamp.\n\n3. Accept the payment of manually filed tax return/payment form including its attachments from taxpayers enrolled in the Bureau's Electronic Filing and Payment System (eFPS) only in case of unavailability of the eFPS and eBIRForms facilities as announced by the BIR or the unavailability of the eFPS-AAB where the taxpayers are enrolled.\n\n4.

Ensure that all payment-related information indicated by the taxpayer on the accomplished Deposit/Payment Slip matches with those indicated on the BIR payment form/tax return prior to acceptance of payment form/tax return and the encoding of the applicable information to prevent discrepancies from occurring.\n\nb. Deposit/Payment Slips must be machine validated while all payment forms/tax returns and its attachments, as may be applicable, must be stamped with \"RECEIVED.\"\n\nNote: The attachments to the income tax return shall be stamped only on the page of the Audit Certificate, the Balance Sheet and the Income Statement. The other pages of the financial statements and its attachments need not be stamped \"Received,\" and in case of corporations and other juridical persons at least two (2) extra copies of the audited financial statements for filing with the SEC should be stamped \"Received\" as provided in RMO Nos. 6-2010 and 13-2011.\n\nc. Transmission of BCS to concerned Revenue Data Centers (RDCs)/National Office Data Center (NODC) is within forty-eight (48) hours on regular days and seventy-two (72) hours during deadlines except in transactions which the BIR specifically requires twenty-four (24)-hour transmission (e.g., payment of capital gains tax). Provided in Annex \"A\" of this bulletin are the procedures of sending BCS to concerned RDCs/NODC using their dedicated email accounts.\n\nd. Coordinate with concerned Head Offices (HO) for the feedback of the daily status of transmission of BCS to BIR which are regularly sent by the latter to the dedicated email account of AAB HO. In cases of suspended or un-uploaded BCS due to errors, follow the procedures provided in Annex A of Bank Bulletin No. 2021-05.\n\ne.

Accept all tax payments even out-of-district returns.\n\na. Batch the out-of-district returns separately; and\n\nb. Encode the tax payment data using the Limited Bank Data Entry System (LBDES)/Bank System indicating the Revenue District Office (RDO) of the accepting AAB branch in the required field of the LBDES/Bank system and NOT the RDO Number of the taxpayer.\n\n2. Accept all tax payments being made by the taxpayers using any of the following:\n\na. BIR official printed forms and copies of system-generated Filing Reference Numbers (FRNs);\n\nb. Photocopies of returns/computer-generated or electronically-filed tax returns; and\n\nc. Downloaded BIR Forms/tax returns originally filled out and signed by the taxpayers or his duly authorized representative.\n\n3. Receive the income tax returns and other tax returns by stamping the official receiving seal on the space provided for in the three (3) copies of the return, whether or not the taxpayer is under the jurisdiction of a regional office with Document Processing Division (DPD). Any copy of the return in excess of three (3) copies shall not be stamped \"RECEIVED\" by the AAB. Accordingly, in the case of corporations and other juridical persons covered by BIR Form No. 1702, stamping of \"RECEIVED\" shall be extended in at least two (2) additional copies of the audited financial statements, aside from those attached in the AITRs, to satisfy the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). CAIHTE\n\n4. Stamp \"RECEIVED\" the attached financial statements to the income tax returns only on the page of the Audit Certificate, the Balance Sheet, and the Income Statement pursuant to RMO No. 13-2010 and the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) executed between the SEC and the BIR.\n\n5. Ensure that the pertinent portion of the income tax returns and other tax returns and/or deposit slips are machine-validated and the details of tax payments should be clearly imprinted in all copies thereof.\n\n6. Accept payments made through checks or combination of cash and check/s or combination of two or more checks in the payment for single tax liability/return. Further, to accept checks which are prepared payable to the Bureau of Internal Revenue, (with or without \"IFO Name and TIN of the taxpayer\" written on the check payment as previously required).\n\n7. Prepare the Batch Control Sheets (BCS) using the Limited Bank Data Entry System (LBDES) for corporate income tax returns, only the form type code of 1702 should be reflected in the said report and the suffixes \"RT\", \"EX\" and \"MX\" must be disregarded pursuant to Bank Bulletin Nos. 2014-06 and 2016-28.\n\n8. Comply with the obligations provided for in the MOA executed by the AABs, the BIR and the Bureau of Treasury (BTr).\n\n9. Accept the tax payments from taxpayers who are already within the bank's premises by the close of the AAB banking hours.\n\n10. Accept check payments even after the bank clearing/cut-off time and just stamp the tax return \"Received after cut-off/clearing\" or with similar stamp.\n\n11. Accept the payment of manually filed and out-of-district returns from taxpayers enrolled in the Bureau's Electronic Filing and Payment System (eFPS) in case of unavailability of the eFPS facility as announced by the BIR, through an advisory posted in the BIR website.\n\n12. Do not impose penalties for any violations committed by the taxpayers in the filing of their tax returns and payments of internal revenue taxes, since it is the Bureau which will be the one to impose whatever appropriate penalties incident to the said violation, in accordance with existing policy.

The transmission of the eCRDC shall be within five (5) days after collection date; and if the due date for the submission of the said report falls on a Saturday, Sunday or Holiday, the transmission of the report should be immediately on the next working day following the non-working day (Bank Bulletin No. 2014-03). However, with the implementation of the Treasury Single Account (TSA) beginning January 2, 2014, the deadline for the electronic submission of the daily CRDC for both Electronic Filing and Payment System (eFPS) and Over-the-Counter (OTC) transactions falls on the same date. In order to avoid occurrence of any error in the uploading of the collection data to the ITS-Collection and Bank Reconciliation System (CBRS) in cases where the concerned AABs have both OTC and electronic payment transactions on the same day, the CRDC for eFPS transactions and online tax payments thru the Bureau of Internal Revenue's Interactive Forms System (IAFS) shall be submitted first not later than 5:00 PM of the prescribed due date. Thereafter, the transmission of CRDC for OTC transactions shall be made after 5:00 PM of the said due date. However, in case tax collections for any given day was made only either thru OTC transactions or eFPS/IAFS transactions, the daily eCRDC shall be submitted anytime of the day within five (5) days reckoned from collection date. aDSIHc\n\nIllustrative example:\n\nChannel of Payment\n\nCollection Date\n\nComputed Due Date\n\nDue Date for e-Submission\n\nTransmission Time\n\n1.

In case of error/s, including over-reporting/remittance and under reporting/remittance, was/were discovered on the day of submission and the AAB opted to correct/revise the CRDC within the same day, the transmission of said revised/corrected CRDC shall be made in the following manner:\n\na. For daily collections with both eFPS/IAFS and OTC Transactions \u2014 The electronic transactions must be submitted not later than 5:00 PM of the same day and not earlier than 5:01 PM for OTC transactions, also of the same day. There shall be no limit in the resubmission of the corrected CRDC provided that it is transmitted within the above-prescribed transmission time.\n\nb. For daily collections with only OTC or eFPS/IAFS Transactions \u2014 The corrected/revised CRDC can be submitted anytime without any restriction on the 5:00 PM cut-off time.\n\n3. In case there is a need to adjust a previously submitted CRDC for eFPS/IAFS transactions, OTC transactions, or both after the original transmission date, the policies and procedures listed below shall be followed:\n\na. If the error is due to over-reporting/remittance \u2014 The concerned AAB shall send the hardcopy of the CRDC together with the List of Adjustments (sample format below) to the Revenue Accounting Division (RAD) to enable the said division to manually modify/adjust the data in the ITS. There is no need for the AAB to transmit the adjusted CRDC through the eCRDC facility. Otherwise, there will be double/multiple posting of collection data in the BIR-ITS.\n\nSample Format: List of Adjustments:\n\nb. If the error is due to under-reporting/remittance \u2014 The AAB shall submit a supplemental report indicating only the bank branch/es and corresponding amount/s that need to be added. There is no need to include the previously reported collection data from the AAB branch/es without error/s.\n\nFurthermore, the word \"SUPPLEMENTAL\" shall be indicated opposite the affected collection date.\n\nExample: If the actual amount of collection by AAB Branch with bank code 086-086 on April 23, 2014 is P1,102.00 but the amount of collection reported in the CRDC was only P1,000.00, or an under-remittance of P102.00, the said adjustment to the CRDC should be reported to the Revenue Accounting Division (RAD) as follows: ETHIDa\n\nApril 23, 2014-SUPPLEMENTAL\nDate of Collection\n\nA.
