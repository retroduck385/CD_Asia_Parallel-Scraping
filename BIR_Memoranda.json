In the said e-mail, Acct Five mentioned about the inconsistencies in the imposition of penalties and interest for filing of an amended tax return. There are Revenue District Offices (RDOs) that impose surcharge, interest and compromise penalty, while other RDOs impose only interest. Hence, this request.\n\nIn reply, please be informed that Sections 248 and 249 (A) of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended, states that: HTcADC\n\n\"SEC. 248.    Civil Penalties. \u2014\n\n(A)    There shall be imposed, in addition to the tax required to be paid, a penalty equivalent to twenty-five percent (25%) of the amount due, in the following cases:\n\n(1)    Failure to file any return and pay the tax due thereon as required under the provisions of this Code or rules and regulations on the date prescribed; or\n\n(2)    Unless otherwise authorized by the Commissioner, filing a return with an internal revenue officer other than those with whom the return is required to be filed; or\n\n(3)    Failure to pay the deficiency tax within the time prescribed for its payment in the notice of assessment; or\n\n(4)    Failure to pay the full or part of the amount of tax shown on any return required to be filed under the provisions of this Code or rules and regulations, or the full amount of tax due for which no return is required to be filed, on or before the date prescribed for its payment.\n\n(B)    In case of willful neglect to file the return within the period prescribed by this Code or by rules and regulations, or in case a false or fraudulent return is willfully made, the penalty to be imposed shall be fifty percent (50%) of the tax or of the deficiency tax, in case, any payment has been made on the basis of such return before the discovery of the falsity or fraud: x x x\"\n\n\"SEC. 249.    Interest. \u2014\n\n(A)    In General. \u2014 There shall be assessed and collected on any unpaid amount of tax, interest at the rate of twenty percent (20%) per annum, or such higher rate as may be prescribed by rules and regulations, from the date prescribed for payment until the amount is fully paid.\" (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)\n\nUnder the above quoted provisions, it is clear that interest of twenty percent (20%) and penalty equivalent to twenty-five percent (25%) of the amount due shall be imposed on failure to file any return and pay the tax due thereon on the date prescribed or failure to pay the full or part of the amount of tax shown on any return as required under the provisions of the National Internal Revenue Code or rules and regulations. Thus, in an amendment of return where an additional tax is due per amended return, 20% interest and 25% penalty shall be imposed based on the additional tax to be paid per amended return.\n\nWith regard to the imposition of compromise penalties, the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) issued Revenue Memorandum Order (RMO) No. 7-2015, (The Revised Consolidated Schedule of Compromise Penalties for Violations of the National Internal Revenue Code) to update the Schedule of Compromise Penalties specified in RMO No. 19-2007. Compromise penalties are only amounts suggested by the BIR in settlement of criminal liability for violations committed by taxpayers, the payment of which is consensual in nature, and may not therefore be imposed or exacted on the taxpayer. Thus, in the event that a taxpayer refuses to pay the suggested compromise penalty, the violation shall be referred to the appropriate office for criminal action.\n\nPlease be guided accordingly.\n\n(SGD.)

                                    "Details": "This has reference to the Memorandum dated February 24, 2015 by former Commissioner Kim S. Jacinto-Henares directing all Regional Directors, Regional Legal Divisions, Revenue District Offices and other Revenue Officials, Employees and others concerned to refrain from issuing Certificate of Tax Exemption (CTE) to cooperatives not specifically identified under Republic Act (RA) No. 9520 such as labor contracting, professionals, construction, mining and other cooperatives similarly created.\n\nThe Bureau also issued Revenue Memorandum Circular (RMC) No. 12-2012 which circularized the instruction of the Cooperative Development Authority (CDA) to its Regional Directors to refrain from registering the cooperatives (i.e., as labor contracting, professional, construction, mining and other cooperatives similarly created) and conduct inspection/examination and/or investigation and to verify complaints that the cooperatives previously registered were used as tax shield which could be considered as fraudulently registered, one of the grounds for cancellation and revocation of Certificate of Registration.\n\nThe affected cooperatives, however, posit that Article 23 of Republic Act (RA) No. 9520, specifically includes a definition of service cooperative as follows:\n\n\"Art. 23. Type and Categories of Cooperatives. \u2014 Types of Cooperatives \u2014 Cooperatives may fall under any of the following types:\n\n(a) xxx xxx xxx\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(e) Service Cooperative is one which engages in medical and dental care, hospitalization, transportation, insurance, housing, labor, electric light and power, communication, professional and other services;\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(u) Other types of cooperatives as may be determined by the Cooperative Development Authority.\"\n\nAside from the service cooperatives, other cooperatives not specifically defined under the afore-quoted provision may also be registered as determined by the CDA. Moreover, RA 9520 expressly provides that any doubt in the interpretation and construction of said law should be resolved liberally in favor of the cooperatives, thus: cTDaEH\n\n\"ART. 142. Interpretation and Construction. \u2014 In case of doubt as to the meaning of any provision of his Code or the regulations issued in pursuance thereof, the same shall be resolved liberally in favor of the cooperatives and their members.\"\n\nIt is worthy to note that in two (2) public hearings conducted by the Senate Committee on Cooperatives, chaired by Sen. Miguel Zubiri, regarding Senate Resolution No. 66 (Directing the Senate Committee and Other Appropriate Senate Committees to Conduct an Inquiry, in Aid of Legislation, on the Failure to Comply of the Bureau of Internal Revenue with Republic Act No. 9520 or the Philippine Cooperative Code of 2008 by Imposing Unreasonable Requirements Anent the Issuance of Certificates of Tax Exemption in Favor of Cooperatives), the issue, among others, on granting tax exemption to service cooperatives covered by Memorandum dated February 24, 2015 of then Commissioner Kim S. Jacinto-Henares was again brought up by affected cooperatives.\n\nWe now seek your guidance on whether or not the tax incentives as provided under RA No. 9520 may be granted to service cooperatives which have been duly registered with CDA.\n\nIt is our position that service cooperatives must not be totally prohibited from availing of the tax incentives provided under RA 9520 provided that they are duly registered with the CDA and have been issued Certificates of Good Standing to show that they are bona fide cooperatives falling under RA 9520. Provided, however, that these cooperatives will be subject to post audit verification to check on whether they are just being used as a tax shield to avoid or evade payment of taxes.\n\nIt is noted that the CDA issued various Memorandum Circulars (MCs) providing for the guidelines for the registration of the following cooperatives, to wit:\n\nAccordingly, service cooperatives that fully comply with the guidelines of the CDA may be given tax exemption certificates provided that they also submit the documents required by the BIR under Revenue Memorandum Order (RMO) No. 76-2010 (Prescribing the Policies and Guidelines in the Issuance of Certificate of Tax Exemption of Cooperatives and the Monitoring Thereof) dated September 27, 2010.\n\nFor your approval.\n\nJESUS CLINT O.

JACINTO-HENARES\nCommissioner of Internal Revenue\n\nATTACHMENT\n\nCommission on Audit\nOffice of the Auditor\n\nAOM No.: RA-2014-021 (2013)\nDate: April 14, 2013\n\nAUDIT OBSERVATION MEMORANDUM (AOM)\n\nOur review of the accomplishments of the National Program Support for Tax Administration Reforms (NPSTAR) as of December 31, 2013 revealed the following observation: aTADCE\n\nManagement failed to maximize the utilization of the loan from the World Bank due to the delays encountered in undertaking the different activities towards full implementation of the programs and projects under the NPSTAR, thus, affected the attainment of the desired outputs and the low availment rate of the loan that resulted to the incurrence by the government of commitment fees amounting P6,098,399.40 as of December 31, 2013.\n\nThe NPSTAR is a four-year project that is intended to finance specified expenditures critical for tax reform administration. The objective of the Project is to assist the Borrower in: (a) increasing taxpayer compliance by improving the efficiency and effectiveness of BIR, and (b) enhancing BIR's capacity to undertake a sustainable and long-term tax administration program. The program, funded by a loan from World Bank, commenced in June 25, 2007 and with original loan closing date of December 31, 2011 with an extension of up to June 30, 2013. The program has four components namely: (a) Tax Compliance; (b) Tax Enforcement and Control; (c) Human Resource Development and Management; and (d) BIR Reform Change Management and Project Management.\n\nIn our last year's observation, there were ten on-going projects; 12 projects with no reported accomplishment; and one completed but with ongoing systems fixes. As a response to the observation, Management submitted updated status of these projects as of April 15, 2013. Follow-up on the status of accomplishment of these projects as of December 31, 2013 showed that of the ten ongoing projects, nine were completed and one was cancelled; of the 12 projects with previously no reported accomplishment, only two were completed and the remaining 10 were cancelled; and the one that was completed still has ongoing systems fixes. Details are as follows:\n\nThe implementation of the project was closed on June 30, 2013. Review of the books of accounts of the NPSTAR showed that despite the loan closing date, the project still had outstanding payables totaling P65,883,723.15 as of December 31, 2013. cEHSIC\n\nInquiry with the concerned personnel disclosed that the reason for the said outstanding payables is that processing of the claims were not completed within the prescribed period after the loan closing date due to incomplete documentation of said claims. Since these claims can no longer be paid from the loan proceeds, said claims will be charged to the regular funds of the Bureau.\n\nVerification with the records of Bureau of the Treasury disclosed that as of December 31, 2013, only USD6,523,781.95 were availed out of the total loan amount of USD11,000,000.00, or an availment rate of 59.31 percent.\n\nThe delays and low availment rate of the loan resulted to not only the incurrence by the government of P6,098,399.40 commitment fees as of December 31, 2013 and unpaid obligations of P65.884 million, but more importantly, hindered the full attainment of the goal of the project.\n\nIn view of the foregoing, we recommend that in the future foreign-funded projects, Management ensure that all activities are carried out as planned and be mindful of the adverse effect of not maximizing the use of available resources in order to minimize, if not avoid commitment fees due to low fund utilization.\n\nMay we have your comments on the foregoing audit observation within five (5) working days from receipt hereof.\n\n(SGD.)

EHTADa\n\nFor observance and compliance of all concerned.\n\n(SGD.) KIM S. JACINTO-HENARES\nCommissioner of Internal Revenue\n\nATTACHMENT\n\nCommission on Audit\nOffice of the Auditor\n\nAOM No. NG-2014-08(2013)\n\nDate: March 21, 2014\n\nAUDIT OBSERVATION MEMORANDUM (AOM)\n\nThe validity and accuracy of the P430,863,292.92 year-end balance of Other Receivables account (SL 142-Dishonored checks thru banks) is doubtful due to the inclusion of dishonored checks totaling P112,309,409.17 which remained unredeemed since 2004.\n\nThe New Government Chart of Accounts (NGAS) described the account Other Receivables (149) as amount due from all debtors not falling under any of the specific types of receivables. In the National Government (NG) books of the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR), said account is debited to record the amount of dishonored checks based on the Monthly List of Dishonored Checks Received and credited once these are redeemed by the taxpayer per Monthly List of Dishonored Checks Redeemed submitted by the Revenue District Offices (RDOs). The BIR Collection Manual provides that accounts receivable emanate, among others, from the non-payment of tax due arising from a dishonored check. HTDCAS\n\nRevenue Memorandum Order (RMO) No. 25-2001 dated October 16, 2001 requires the Revenue Accounting Division (RAD) to prepare a listing of all dishonored checks received and deducted from the bank's remittances based on the Consolidated Report of Collection and Deposit (CRDC) and BIR Form 12.58 submitted by the Bank Head Office of Authorized Agent Banks (AABs) for recording in the Bureau's books of accounts. The RAD validates the reported dishonored checks by comparing the list as appearing in BIR Form 12.58 attached to the CRDC against the Monthly List of Dishonored Checks Received submitted by RDOs. The Legal Division of the Revenue Regional Offices (RROs) prepare and submit a Monthly Status Report on Dishonored Checks Received (Annex G of RMO 25-2001) and file cases in court against the delinquent taxpayers for violation of Batas Pambansa Blg. 22. The RDOs submit a similar report (Annex F of RMO-2001) showing in summary the quantity of cases and the total outstanding dishonored checks for the month while the Collection Service receives the status report and monitors the progress of resolution/redemption of dishonored checks received by the RDOs and Legal Division of the Regional Offices.\n\nDishonored checks are included in the category of Unpaid Self-Assessed Tax and if not redeemed within a certain period, they are considered delinquent account (DA) and automatically considered high priority case. BIR Operations Memorandum (OM) No. 13-03-001 dated March 12, 2013 provided for the Pilot Implementation of Centralized Arrears Management for Metro Manila Regions (Revenue Regions 5, 6, 7 and 8) which adopted the centralized administration and management of Accounts Receivable/Delinquent Accounts (AR/Das) at the Regional Collection Divisions (RCDs). Selected Seizure Agents (SAs) were assigned to test \"the new procedures and policies intended to provide meaningful steps to understand the behavior of AR/DA inventory and provide efficient compliance interventions.\"\n\nBIR OM No. 13-03-001 dated March 12, 2013 provides that new AR/DA dockets/cases arising from unpaid self-assessed taxes shall be transmitted by the RDOs to the RCD covered by a transmittal list. For unpaid tax arising from dishonored check, the docket shall contain a certified true copy of the manually filed return, original copy of the dishonored check, and report of returned dishonored check. The physical docket shall be transmitted by the RDO to the RCD within ten (10) working days reckoned from the date when the dishonored check was physically returned by the bank. caIACE\n\nRMO No. 43-2004 dated August 5, 2004 provides the \"General Control Ledger (GCL), BIR Form No. 1253\" as a master control devise which shows the aging of accounts and summary of receivables (AR/DAs) of the Bureau. In order to achieve accurate inventory of AR/DAs, BIR OM No. 3-2013 dated April 15, 2013 was issued and the GCL form (BIR Form 0319) was revised to include new AR/DAs. The offices preparing the GCL were reminded of the monthly submission thereof to the Accounts Receivable Monitoring Division (ARMD), formerly the Collection Enforcement Division (CED), together with the following attachments:\n\na. BIR Form 0335 \u2014 Monthly List of New Accounts Added\n\nb. BIR Form 0311 \u2014 Monthly List of Transfer-In Accounts\n\nc. BIR Form 0312 \u2014 Monthly List of Transfer-Out Accounts\n\nd. BIR Form 0313 \u2014 Monthly List of Accounts Cancelled by ATCA\n\ne. BIR Form 0314 \u2014 Monthly List of Accounts Paid\n\nf. Updates on Delinquent Accounts/Unpaid Second Installments and Unredeemed Dishonored Checks Being Handled (Annex B, OM No. 3-2013)\n\nBIR OM No. 3-2013 required every office handling AR/DA case to submit the GCL report, including the updates on delinquent accounts, in hard and soft copies every 15th day of the following month. It was emphasized that non-submission and submission of inaccurate or delayed reports of AR/DA would result in the distortion of the database that would eventually be uploaded in the Accounts Receivable Management System (ARMS). DCScaT\n\nAt present, the RAD records the redemption of dishonored checks on the basis of the Monthly List of Dishonored Checks Redeemed submitted by the RDOs. Inquiry disclosed that the RDOs submit the Monthly Status Report of Dishonored Checks Received; however, said report bears no significance to RAD since the data of the report show only the quantity and amount of delinquent cases and dockets. On the other hand, the Monthly Status Report on Dishonored Checks Received (Annex G of RMO 25-2001) being prepared by the Legal Division showing the taxpayers' name and status of cases are not regularly submitted to RAD. Thus, the RAD has no other basis to record the redemption or settlement by the taxpayer other than the Monthly Status Report of Dishonored Checks Redeemed.\n\nIt has to be emphasized that the AR/DAs are not recorded in the books of accounts of the Bureau, but only disclosed in the Notes to Financial Statements. The Bureau considers them as contingent assets and recognized as revenue once these are collected. Since the RAD has no other report to use as basis in crediting the account Other Receivables in order to record redemption or other forms of settlement of the unpaid tax, there is a great probability that unredeemed dishonored checks already included as AR/DAs in the GCL and those already settled/closed are still included in the account Other Receivables of the NG books.\n\nVerification of the subsidiary ledgers of Other Receivables in the e-NGAS disclosed 94 taxpayers with aggregate dishonored checks totaling P112,309,409.17 (Annex A). Of this amount, P1,806,175.00 has been outstanding prior to 2004, while the P110,503,234.17 has remained in the books from 2004 to 2013. In the absence of verifiable documents from Management, it could not be ascertained how much of these Other Receivables were already transferred or formed part of the GCL. Interviews made with concerned BIR officials disclosed that the Bureau has no clear cut policy on when Other Receivables arising from dishonored checks are to be transferred and recorded in the GCL.\n\nThe P112,309,409.17 Other Receivables are summarized per region as follows: ESTcIA\n\nThus, the validity and accuracy of the reported P430,863,292.92 year-end balance of Other Receivables account (SL 142-Dishonored checks thru banks) is doubtful due to outstanding dishonored checks totaling P112,309,409.17 which have been existing from 2004 to 2013.\n\nWe recommend that Management:\n\n1. Require the Legal Division to regularly prepare and submit to the Assistant Commissioner, Collection Service, copy furnished the RDO and the Regional Office, the Monthly Status Report on Dishonored Checks Received (Annex G of the RMO 25-001);\n\n2. Require the RDOs to furnish the RAD with a list of dishonored checks considered as AR/DAs in the GCL of the concerned Regional Office to serve as basis of the RAD to adjust the account Other Receivables; and\n\n3. Issue a policy on when Other Receivables arising from dishonored checks should be transferred and recorded in the GCL and should form part of Notes to the Financial Statements.\n\nMay we have your comments on the foregoing audit observations within five working days from receipt hereof. caCEDA\n\n(SGD.)

Inasmuch as the Performance-Based Bonus system was adopted to reward exemplary performance in the government, adopting the \"Very Satisfactory\" rating serves as a further incentive for Third Level Officials, who would nonetheless be entitled to their regular salaries and emoluments in case of average performance, to improve the same. TAEDcS\n\nWHEREAS, the reduction in the rating of performance of Third Level Officials in the Career Executive Service (CES) from \"Very Satisfactory\" to \"Satisfactory\" would not be in accord with the standards set by the Board for the appointment to and promotion in CES rank of Third Level Officials, which both require a \"Very Satisfactory\" rating as set in CESB Resolution Number 798, Series of 2009, [1] in relation to CESB Resolution Number 661, Series of 2007.

AICEDc\n\nNotably, the matter was earlier explained by the Civil Service Commission (CSC) in the provisions of CSC Memorandum Circular (MC) No. 13, series of 2007 amending Sec. 63, Rule XVI of the Omnibus Rules on Leave, CSC MC Nos. 41 and 14, series of 1998 and 1999 respectively, pursuant to CSC Resolution No. 07-0631 dated April 10, 2007, quoted herein as follows:\n\n\"Sec. 63. Effect of absences without approved leave. \u2014 An officer or employee who is continuously absent without approved leave for at least thirty (30) working days shall be considered on absence without official leave (AWOL) and shall be separated from the service or dropped from the rolls without prior notice. However, when it is clear that under the obtaining circumstances that the official or employee concerned, has established a scheme to circumvent the rule by incurring substantial absences though less than thirty (30) working days 3x in a semester, such that a pattern is already apparent, dropping from the rolls without notice may likewise be justified.\n\nIf the number of unauthorized absences incurred is less than thirty (30) working days, a written Return-to-Work Order may be served to him at his last known address on record. Failure on his part to report for work within the period stated in the Order shall be valid ground to drop him from the rolls.\"\n\nThus, all heads of offices of this Bureau, are henceforth, directed to strictly implement said provision and to report and/or recommend to the Personnel Division/Human Resource Management Unit (HRMU) for dropping from the rolls, revenue officials and employees falling under the afore-quoted provision.\n\nAccordingly, to ensure that a revenue official or employee is afforded due process, the following procedural requirements must be observed:\n\n1. The employee has been absent for a period of time as provided above, supported with Certification of Absences from Head of Office, Certification from HRMU Head and certified true copy of Summary Report of Attendance (SRA);\n\n2. For employees with unauthorized absences of less than thirty (30) working days:\n\na. A Return to Work Order (RTWO) shall be issued and served on the employee as supported by a copy of the said order with proof of service; CaAcSE\n\nb. The AWOL person failed to report for work despite the RTWO as supported by Certification by the Head of Office of the employee; and\n\n3. The dropping from the rolls shall be recommended by the Head of Office and concurred by the concerned Regional Director/Asst. Commissioner.\n\nFinally, all heads of offices concerned are hereby reminded and enjoined to strictly enforce and carry out this Memorandum, taking into account Section 12 of the Revised Code of Conduct for Revenue Officers and Employees as implemented by Revenue Memorandum Order No. 53-2010 dated June 11, 2010, to wit:\n\n\"Every Revenue Official who is a Head of Office shall be held fully accountable for his/her decisions and actions. Similarly, he/she shall be liable for the acts, conduct and/or behavior of those under his/her jurisdiction/supervision, if it is proven that he/she has knowledge of, or ought to have known of, such acts, conduct or behavior. He/She shall likewise be responsible for upholding and enhancing the efficiency of all BIR personnel under his/her supervision, and shall report in writing to the proper authorities any incidence of neglect of duty, incompetence or malfeasance of which he/she may obtain knowledge, with a statement of all the facts and/or any evidence relating to each case.\n\nHe/She shall also ensure that all pertinent issuances affecting the enforcement of the National Internal Revenue Code and its implementing rules are faithfully complied with and enforced by the BIR personnel under his/her supervision.\n\nNon-compliance therewith shall be considered as Simple Neglect of Duty and shall constitute a Less Grave Offense.\"\n\nSection 43 thereof further provides for the penalty of Simple Neglect of Duty as follows:\n\nFor the information, guidance and strict compliance of all concerned.

The RA schedule follows:\n\n7.2.3 In exceptional cases when an incumbent is prevented from the use of a government motor transportation for 3 days or more, such as when the motor vehicle undergoes repair and a replacement vehicle is not provided, the grant of TA may be allowed, pro-rated based on the number of days of actual work performance on workdays without an official vehicle, as follows: TEHI\n\n8.0 RATA for OICs of Positions Entitled to These Allowances\n\n8.1 For OICs Who are Not Assigned or Who Do Not Use Government Motor Transportation\n\n8.1.1 An OIC of a position, authorized in an agency staffing pattern and entitled to RATA, may be allowed to collect the RATA for the position on reimbursable basis, if stipulated in the office order designating him/her as such.\n\n8.1.2 The grant of RATA shall be in accordance with the provisions of sub-items 6.1 to 6.4 hereof.\n\n8.2 For OICs Who are Assigned or Who Use Government Motor Transportation\n\nThe OIC may be allowed to collect only the RA on reimbursable basis.

R.A. No. 6758 \u2014 \"An Act Prescribing a Revised Compensation and Position Classification System in the Government and for Other Purposes,\" dated August 21, 1989.\n\n3. As derived from Sec. 317, Article 8, Chapter 5, Volume 1, Government Accounting and Auditing Manual (GAAM),RATA is commutable if the grant thereof is specifically authorized by law and if funds for its payment are provided for in the agency budget. Payment of RATA presupposes actual rendition of services in line with official duties.\n\n4. As derived from Sec. 286, Article 1, Chapter 5, Volume 1, GAAM, reimbursable RATA should be duly supported by receipts or by a certificate to the effect that the expenses had been incurred in accordance with the purpose for which the allowance is granted.\n\n5. In general, there are 22 workdays in a month, exclusive of Saturdays and Sundays which are rest days.\n\n6. To illustrate the application of the RATA schedule:\n\n7. Full-time attendance in a scholarship/study/training grant is understood to mean that the official/employee is unable to perform the duties and responsibilities of his/her position.\n\nPublished in The Philippine Star on May 23, 2013.",

To facilitate the review and evaluation process, particularly on the technical aspects, COA Memorandum No. 91-704 was issued and was later restated and updated by COA Memorandum No. 2005-027, defining the documentary and information requirements, and providing therein the checklists for all types of technical evaluation covered by the memorandum.\n\n1.2 These issuances notwithstanding, it has been observed that management's submission of copies of perfected contracts and supporting documents within the prescribed period had not been complied with and is, at times, lacking in basic supporting documents. In view of these circumstances and the irregularities discovered in government contracts, it has become imperative to reiterate the submission of the requirements to implement a systematic and effective review process with a view of generating timely and relevant audit results.\n\n2.0 Coverage\n\n2.1 This circular shall cover all contracts, purchase orders and the like, entered into by any government agency irrespective of amount involved.\n\n3.0 Submission and Review Process\n\n3.1 Contracts\n\n3.1.1 Within five (5) working days from the execution of a contract by the government or any of its subdivisions, agencies or instrumentalities, including government-owned and controlled corporations and their subsidiaries, a copy of said contract and each of all the documents forming part thereof by reference or incorporation shall be furnished to the Auditor of the agency concerned.

Such other documents peculiar to the contract and/or to the mode of procurement and considered necessary in the auditorial review and in the technical evaluation thereof.\n\n3.1.3 For technical review purposes, submission of contracts and their supporting documents shall furthermore be guided by the specific documentary requirements outlined in the attached checklist marked as Annexes \"A\" to \"T\" of this circular.\n\n3.1.4 The Auditor shall review the contract within a period ranging from five (5) to twenty (20) working days from receipt, depending on the complexity of the contract. The auditorial review shall consist in the evaluation of compliance with the requirements of applicable laws, rules and regulations, completeness of documentary requirements and an initial evaluation that the contractual covenants are not disadvantageous to the government. Without waiting for the lapse of the period herein established, the Auditor concerned shall call the immediate attention of management regarding defects and deficiencies noted in the contract and suggest such corrective measures as are appropriate and warranted. Where the defect or deficiency is not susceptible of rectification and renders the contract totally or partially void, the head of the agency shall be notified within twenty-four (24) hours from such determination indicating the reasons therein.\n\n3.1.5 Within five (5) working days after the auditorial review, the Auditor shall forward the contract and its supporting documents for technical review to the Technical Audit Specialist (TAS) assigned in the auditing unit/cluster or to the Regional Technical Services Office (RTSO), as the case may be, accompanied by the relevant checklist of documentary requirements mentioned in item 3.1.3 hereof.\n\n3.1.6 The TAS shall complete the technical review thereof as follows:\n\n3.1.7 The procedures and timelines herein outlined shall also apply to supplementary contracts, variation orders and the like.\n\n3.2 Purchase Orders\n\n3.2.1 A copy of any purchase order irrespective of amount, and each and every supporting document, shall, within five (5) working days from issuance thereof, be submitted to the Auditor concerned. Within the same period, the Auditor shall review and point out to management defects and/or deficiencies, if any, in the same manner provided in the second and third sentences of item 3.1.4 hereof.

Gracia M. Pulido Tan and Commissioners Heidi L. Mendoza and Juanito G. Espino Jr. relative to the abovementioned subject matter which takes effect immediately. HIDCTA\n\nYou are enjoined to post the copy of this issuance in your Office Bulletin Board, or in a conspicuous place within your Office, to ensure that it shall be given the most extensive publicity possible for compliance.\n\n(SGD.) KIM S. JACINTO-HENARES\nCommissioner of Internal Revenue\n\nATTACHMENT\n\nNovember 28, 2012\n\nCOA CIRCULAR NO. 004-12\n\n1.0 Rationale\n\nUnder existing regulations, cash advances must, as a rule, be liquidated within the prescribed periods depending upon the nature and purpose of the cash advance (e.g., for salaries and wages; petty and field operating expenses; local travel and foreign travel). Included among operating expenses are cash advances for the payment of honoraria and similar payments to officials and employees; operating expenditures for special projects and activities like anniversary celebration; and special purpose and time bound activity like cultural and athletic activities. These must be liquidated within twenty (20) days from accomplishment of the purpose. SaAcHE\n\n2.0 Settlement and Liquidation of Cash Advance\n\nA cash advance is settled and liquidated either by returning the money advanced if unspent, or by the presentation of regularly accomplished vouchers, giving satisfactory detail of the items thereon paid which must be in accordance with the purpose for which the cash advance was granted, and further supported by proper receipts and other evidence of payment, subject to the result of the post-audit thereof by the auditor concerned.\n\n3.0 Primary responsibility of Heads of Agencies\n\nUnder Section 2 of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1445, the Government Auditing Code of the Philippines places the responsibility to faithfully take care that government funds and property be safeguarded from wastage directly with and primarily on the chief or head of the government agency concerned.\n\n4.0 Outstanding amounts of cash advances in government\n\nAudit, however, reveals that unliquidated cash advances in government have reached a staggering sum in the aggregate, and despite repeated demands and requests for liquidation, the advances have remained unliquidated.\n\n5.0 Legal presumption against non-liquidation of cash advance\n\nArticle 217 of the Revised Penal Code states in unequivocal terms that: \"The failure of a public officer to have duly forthcoming any public funds or property with which he is chargeable, upon demand by any duly authorized officer, shall be prima facie evidence that he has put such missing funds or property to personal use.\"\n\n6.0 Final demand to settle unliquidated cash advance\n\nWherefore, final notice and demand is hereby made to all concerned to settle and liquidate all outstanding cash advances as of December 31, 2011 on or before January 31, 2013. Provided, however, that those who have been issued by the Commission on Audit notice and demand, prior to the issuance of this Circular, to settle and liquidate their cash advances within a specified period, shall do so within the period specified in the said notice.\n\nFor purposes of this Circular, an accountable public officer refers to a public officer or employee who, in the discharge of his office, receives money from the government which he is bound to later account for. Transfer, separation or retirement from the government does not operate to discharge the said person from coverage of the definition and corresponding duty to account for the unliquidated advances. ICDSca\n\nThis Circular shall serve as the demand required under appropriate law, rules and regulations to settle the accountable officer's unliquidated cash advance as well as all those who are already separated from the service or have transferred to other agency.\n\n7.0 Duty of Agency officials\n\nOn or before December 15, 2012, all heads of government agencies shall disseminate in writing this Circular to all accountable officials and employees within their respective agencies and serve a written notice to and demand settlement of the outstanding cash advances as of December 31, 2011.\n\nThe Chief Accountant shall, within the same period, furnish the head of agency and the head of the auditing unit thereat a list of accountable officers with unliquidated and outstanding cash advances.\n\n8.0 Duty of the Commission on Audit\n\nIt shall be the duty of the head of the auditing unit/Audit Team Leader in the agency to ensure that the outstanding cash advances are liquidated within the periods specified above. In addition, he shall evaluate the cash advances of accountable officer to determine compliance with the requirements of pertinent COA rules and regulations and to report violations thereof.\n\nMoreover, the auditors concerned shall report on or before February 28, 2013 to the agency head and to the Director, Fraud Audit and Investigation Office, this Commission, compliance with this Circular including an aging of the cash advance balances of accountable officers in such form showing the purpose of the cash advance and other information required.\n\nThe Auditors shall submit to their respective Directors the vouchers and all supporting documents relative to the grant of the unliquidated cash advances copy furnished the Office of the Chairperson, this Commission.\n\n9.0 Consequences of failure to liquidate\n\n9.1 Failure of an accountable officer to liquidate his outstanding cash advance on or before January 31, 2013 shall constitute cause for the filing of malversation charge under Article 217, failure to liquidate cash advance under Article 218, both of the Revised Penal Code or criminal prosecution under Section 128 of P.D. No. 1445. IaDcTC\n\n9.2 The suspension of salaries of erring accountable officers shall be ordered by the auditor concerned to the proper agency official through the head of the Agency.\n\n9.3 Appropriate administrative proceedings shall likewise be instituted.\n\n10.0 Monitoring Compliance\n\nThe Assistant Commissioners concerned shall monitor compliance by the auditor under their jurisdiction.\n\n11.0 Effectivity\n\nThis Circular shall take effect immediately. All previous issuances by this Commission inconsistent herewith are deemed amended or modified accordingly.\n\nQuezon City, Philippines.\n\n(SGD.) MA. GRACIA M. PULIDO TAN\nChairperson\n\n(SGD.)

This progressive approach showed increased donor rates, thus a very interesting fund raising strategy which we want to utilize to its full potential. TaDAIS\n\nDirect Debit Donor Program aims to achieve the following objectives:\n\n\u2022 To create a sustainable long-term donation from a loyal donor base, generating reliable fund for UNICEF Philippines to continue its work.\n\n\u2022 To raise awareness about UNICEF Philippines, its mission and projects.\n\n\u2022 To build a meaningful relationship between a donor and UNICEF Philippines.\n\n\u2022 To create an affordable and convenient avenue for average income earners to be champions for children through UNICEF Philippines.\n\nDirect Debit Donor Programme (DDDP) uses direct persuasive efforts to recruit donors, targeting individuals in corporate offices, major shopping malls and SME's as well as setting up various provincial road show booths in high traffic areas. Through each avenue, the potential donor is educated on UNICEF Philippines' work. Donors who agree to contribute do so by signing a donor form, stipulating their account details and chosen monthly donation amount.

Should there be any space restrictions we need to observe, we are amenable to make adjustments in order to comply.\n\nPotential donors will be approached by our professional fundraisers who will be representing UNICEF Philippines as they carry-out this campaign in your company. They will have proper identification. Should you need to contact us further, you may call our donor support hotline: +63917-8560372.

ASHICc\n\n2.0 Guidelines\n\nMoratorium on the Filling of Positions/Hiring of Personnel\n\n2.1 The moratorium on the filling of regular/permanent/itemized positions, either through original appointment, promotion, transfer or reemployment, and the hiring of new casuals/contractuals, including personnel on consultancy/emergency/contract of service/job order basis, shall continue to be implemented in all Departments/Agencies/GOCCs/GFIs of the Executive Branch whose RP has not yet been approved by this Department, consistent with Section 7 of EO 366 and Section 13.a of its Implementing Rules and Regulations.\n\nThe temporary suspension shall not apply to teaching positions, medical and allied medical items in hospitals and other medical facilities servicing agency clients, as well as to uniformed positions in the Departments of National Defense, the Interior and Local Government, Transportation and Communications, and Environment and Natural Resources.\n\nHowever, medical and allied medical positions which primarily provide service to agency personnel are covered by the moratorium.\n\nAuthority to Renew Appointments/Contracts\n\n2.2 Department Secretaries/Agency Heads shall continually be allowed to renew the appointments of personnel on casual status and the contracts of personnel under contractual basis, as well as those hired as consultants, for the period that the Department/Agency is undergoing rationalization activities, but not to go beyond one (1) month after the approval of the agency's RP, or 31 December 2012, whichever comes earlier, except those personnel whose authorized period of hiring should not go beyond 30 June 2012 and those with specific deliverables for a set timeframe, subject to pertinent budgetary, civil service, accounting and auditing rules and regulations, and the following conditions: CAHTIS\n\na. For National Government Agencies, the funds appropriated for the purpose are sufficient and the action would not entail additional budgetary release or the realignment of non-Personal Services (PS) funds to PS;\n\nb. In the case of GOCCs/GFIs, funds for the purpose shall be charged against internally-generated funds/project funds included in the Board-approved Corporate Operating Budget;\n\nc. The maximum number of personnel whose contracts/appointments would be renewed shall not exceed the actual employees at the start of the Department/Agency's rationalization efforts, as adjusted by the DBM-authorized hiring of new/additional personnel; and\n\nd. There shall be no new hiring and/or replacement of resigned/retired/separated/terminated/regularized staff.\n\n2.3 The renewal of appointments/contracts of personnel for projects with DBM-approved staffing pattern shall be limited to the existing number of authorized positions and to the set timeframe for hiring.\n\nOutsourcing of Certain Services by Agencies with Approved RP\n\n2.4 Departments/Agencies/GOCCs/GFIs with approved RP are allowed to outsource certain services, thru the hiring of consultants/job order/contract of service personnel, provided it is consistent with the following:\n\na. Pertinent budgetary, civil service, accounting and auditing rules and regulations;\n\nb. Overall policy under the approved RP on services/areas which could be outsourced (e.g., utility, building and grounds maintenance, messengerial, security, transportation/mobility, and information technology); and\n\nc. Agency policy on which other services to outsource. ETIHCa\n\nThe agencies should likewise ensure that the hiring of consultants/job order/contract of service personnel would contribute to the attainment of their objectives and would not adversely affect the implementation of their regular programs/projects and the achievement of their work targets.\n\n2.5 Agencies which have coterminus with the incumbent (CTI) positions are prohibited from hiring personnel whose functions are similar to those being performed by the incumbents of the CTI items.\n\nPolicy on the Rehiring of Retired/Separated Personnel\n\n2.6 Government personnel who opted to retire/be separated from the service as a result of the rationalization efforts of their Department/Agency shall not be appointed nor hired as casuals or contractuals in any agency of the Executive Branch, including in GOCCs/GFIs, for a period of five (5) years, except as teaching or medical staff in educational institutions and hospitals, or hired as a consultant/contract of service/job order personnel where there is no employer-employee relationship, as the case may be, with reemployment in any Branch of Government to be considered as new entry to the civil service.\n\n3.0 Responsibility Clause\n\nIt shall be the responsibility of the Department Secretaries and equivalent Agency Heads to strictly implement the provisions of this Circular Letter, including the laws, rules and regulations indicated herein. In case of any violation of the same, the official authorizing such action shall be held responsible for whatever expenses the government incurred for not strictly following said issuances.\n\n4.0 Applicability Clause\n\nThe provisions of this Circular Letter shall be applicable until revoked.\n\n5.0 Effectivity\n\nThis Circular Letter shall take effect upon its publication in a newspaper of general circulation.

If upon publication, there are qualified applicants other than the temporary employee, the appointing authority shall require the temporary employee to undergo Personnel Selection Board (PSB) screening together with the other applicants.\n\n3. If upon publication there are no other qualified applicants, the appointing authority may decide to appoint the temporary employee, provided the latter's performance rating is at least Satisfactory. EASCDH\n\na) If the performance rating is at least Satisfactory, the temporary employee shall be required to undergo PSB screening and probationary period.\n\nb) If the performance rating is Very Satisfactory or higher, the temporary employee shall be exempted from PSB screening and probationary period.\n\nc) The temporary employee should present to the appointing authority proofs of meeting the deficiencies (such as the certificate of eligibility or proof of meeting the education, training and/or experience requirements).\n\n4. If finally, after compliance with policy numbers 1, 2 and 3 hereof, the existing temporary employee is appointed again:\n\na) A new (permanent) appointment should be issued.\n\nb) The date of effectivity of the appointment is the date of issuance of the permanent appointment, not the date the deficiency in qualification standards was met or proof thereof was presented.\n\n5. The nature of appointment of a temporary employee who has been issued a permanent appointment is not change of status, but reappointment or reemployment, if in the case of the latter, there is gap in the service. aICcHA\n\n6.

Rule VI of the same Omnibus Rules\n\nd) Section 5 (c) of the Rules on Probationary Period for Permanent Appointment in the Career Service (CSC MC No. 3, s. 2005)\n\nAll other rules and regulations which are inconsistent herewith are deemed modified accordingly.\n\nThis Memorandum Circular takes effect fifteen (15) days from the publication of CSC Resolution No. 07-0629 in a newspaper of general circulation.\n\n(SGD.) KARINA CONSTANTINO-DAVID\nChairman\n\nPublished in The Manila Times on May 10, 2007.\n\nApril 4, 2007\n\nCSC RESOLUTION NO. 070629\n\nREVISED POLICIES ON CHANGE OF STATUS OF APPOINTMENT FROM TEMPORARY TO PERMANENT\n\nWHEREAS, Section 2 (1), Article IX-B of the 1987 Constitution, provides that the Civil Service embraces all branches, subdivisions, instrumentalities and agencies of the Government, including government-owned or controlled corporations with original charters;\n\nWHEREAS, Section 12 (3), Chapter 3, Title I (A), Book V of the Administrative Code of 1987, provides that the Commission shall promulgate policies, standards and guidelines for the Civil Service and adopt plans and programs to promote economical, efficient and effective personnel administration in the government;\n\nWHEREAS, Section 12 (14), Chapter 3, Title I (A), Book V of the Administrative Code of 1987, provides that the Commission shall take appropriate action on all appointments and other personnel matters in the Civil Service;\n\nWHEREAS, Section 2, Rule IV (Effectivity of Appointment) of the Revised Omnibus Rules on Appointments and Other Personnel Actions (CSC MC No. 40, s. 1998 as amended by CSC MC No. 15, s. 1999) provides that: \". . . The effectivity of the change of status should be the date of release of the result of the examination and/or the date of issuance of appropriate license/s. The same shall be made upon the presentation of the certificate of eligibility to the proper civil service field/regional office and subsequent verification of its authenticity. Said office shall indicate the effectivity of the change of status from temporary to permanent as a footnote on the temporary appointment and service card on file.\" (emphasis supplied); TADCSE\n\nWHEREAS, the Supreme Court, in the case of Torio vs. CSC, 209 SCRA 677, held the principle that \"(a) permanent appointment is not a continuation of the temporary appointment \u2014 these are two distinct acts of the appointing authority.\" (Emphasis supplied);\n\nWHEREAS, in explaining further the said principle, the High Tribunal, in the case of Province of Camarines Sur vs. CA, 246 SCRA 281, ruled that: \". . . Such lack of civil service eligibility made his appointment temporary and without a fixed and definite term and is dependent entirely upon the pleasure of the appointing power. The fact that private respondent obtained a civil service eligibility later on is of no moment as his having passed the supervisory security guard examination, did not ipso facto convert his temporary appointment into a permanent one. In cases such as the one at bench, what is required is a new appointment since a permanent appointment is not a continuation of the temporary appointment \u2014 these are two distinct acts of the appointing authority.\" (emphasis supplied);\n\nWHEREAS, in view of the aforequoted Supreme Court rulings, the Commission recognizes the need to amend its existing policies pertaining to change of status from temporary to permanent, specifically Section 4 (i), Rule III, Section 2, Rule IV (Effectivity of Appointment), and Section 6, Rule VI of the Revised Omnibus Rules on Appointments and Other Personnel Actions (CSC MC No. 40, s. 1998 as amended by CSC MC No. 15, s. 1999);\n\nWHEREAS, an incumbent temporary appointee whose performance rating while on temporary status is very satisfactory or higher is likely to have proven his/her capacity and hence, need not be subjected to probationary period when appointed again, this time on permanent status;\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, the Commission, in the exercise of its rule-making and policy formulation functions, RESOLVED to adopt the following revised policies and guidelines on change of status of appointment from temporary to permanent:\n\n1. The position involved should be published in compliance with Item 8 of CSC MC No. 20, s. 2002, which provides that a position occupied by a temporary employee should be published and posted every 6 months reckoned from the date the position was last published.

If upon publication, there are qualified applicants other than the temporary employee, the appointing authority shall require the temporary employee to undergo PSB screening together with the other applicants.\n\n3. If upon publication there are no other qualified applicants, the appointing authority may decide to appoint the temporary employee, provided the latter's performance rating is at least Satisfactory.\n\na) If the performance rating is at least Satisfactory, the temporary employee shall be required to undergo PSB screening and probationary period.\n\nb) If the performance rating is Very Satisfactory or higher, the temporary employee shall be exempted from PSB screening and probationary period.\n\nc) The temporary employee should present to the appointing authority proofs of meeting the deficiencies (such as the certificate of eligibility or proof of meeting the education, training and/or experience requirements).\n\n4. If finally, after compliance with Item numbers 1, 2 and 3 hereof, the existing temporary employee is appointed again:\n\na) A new (permanent) appointment should be issued.\n\nb) The date of effectivity of the appointment is the date of issuance of the permanent appointment, not the date the deficiency in qualification standards was met or proof thereof was presented.\n\n5. The nature of appointment of a temporary employee who has been issued a permanent appointment is not change of status, but reappointment or reemployment, if in the case of the latter, there is gap in the service. EDISTc\n\nRESOLVED FURTHER that the abovementioned policies expressly amend or repeal the following rules:\n\na. Section 4 (i) Rule III of the Omnibus Rules on Appointments and Other Personnel Actions (CSC MC No. 40, s. 1998 as amended by CSC MC No. 15, s. 1999)\n\nb.

Section 5 (c) of the Rules on Probationary Period for Permanent Appointment in the Career Service (CSC MC No. 3, s. 2005)\n\nAll other rules and regulations which are inconsistent herewith are deemed modified accordingly.\n\nThis Resolution shall take effect fifteen (15) days after publication in a newspaper of general circulation.

AQUINO III, President of the Philippines, by virtue of the powers vested in me by the Constitution and by law, do hereby order the following:\n\nSEC. 1. Revised Guidelines in the Computation of Incentives. \u2014 The incentives that shall be received by personnel who will be affected by the RP under EO No. 366 and opt to avail of the retirement benefit under RA No. 660 or the applicable retirement/separation/unemployment benefit provided under RA No. 8291 shall be computed using their actual monthly salary as of 31 December 2011. cSHIaA\n\nThe incentive factors under EO No. 366 shall continuously be adopted. For the purpose of computing the total amount of incentive, only the government service of an affected personnel up to age 59 and a fraction thereof shall be counted.\n\nThe terminal leave benefits and retirement/separation/unemployment benefits of the affected employees, which are being released by the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) and the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS),respectively, shall be based on the existing rules and regulations on the matter.\n\nSEC. 2.  Availment of Incentives of Affected Personnel from Agencies with Approved Rationalization Plan (RP). \u2014 Personnel who were affected as a result of the approval of the RP of their respective department/agency/government-owned and/or controlled corporation (GOCC)/government financial institution (GFI) and opted to remain either in their mother agency or in another agency shall be allowed to avail of the retirement/separation/unemployment benefits under RA No. 660 or RA No. 8291, including the applicable incentives, within one (1) month from the effectivity of this Order.\n\nConsistent with Section 1 hereof, the incentives of said personnel shall be computed using their actual monthly salary as of 31 December 2011.\n\nSEC. 3. Payment of Incentives of Affected Personnel Who Retired/Separated Starting 01 July 2007 but Before the Issuance of This Order. \u2014 The incentives of those affected personnel who have already availed of the retirement/separation/unemployment benefits under the aforementioned retirement laws and whose retirement/separation from government service became effective starting 01 July 2007 but before the issuance of this Order shall be based on their actual monthly salary as of the date of their retirement, subject to the recomputation of their incentive by their respective agency and validation by the DBM, and the existing budgeting, accounting and auditing rules and regulations.\n\nSEC. 4. Suspension of the Creation of Regular Positions. \u2014 Departments/agencies/GOCCs/GFIs with approved RP shall not be allowed additional regular positions for at least five (5) years, except the following: TcCEDS\n\na) Those to be created under the \"scrap and build policy\" where there is no additional cost to the government;\n\nb) Population-related items such as policemen, teachers, and medical and allied medical positions for hospitals and similar facilities; and,\n\nc) For mandated new functions which cannot be absorbed by existing units/positions, as determined by the DBM.\n\nSEC. 5.

Repealing Clause. \u2014 All other issuances, rules, and regulations or parts thereof which are inconsistent with this Order are hereby repealed or modified accordingly.\n\nSEC. 8. Effectivity. \u2014 This Order shall take effect upon its publication in the Official Gazette or in a newspaper of general circulation.\n\nDONE in the City of Manila, this 8th day of May, in the year of Our Lord, Two Thousand and Twelve.

However, processing will be done only in the Head Office (Metro Manila) and Branch Office (Cebu City). Revenue Regions outside Metro Manila and Cebu City will have to send the films to the Head Office and Branch Office and there is the danger of getting lost before and after processing; and aDHCEA\n\n4) High cost of maintenance of microfilm, wherein storage area of the film in a room with a controlled environment is extremely important, such as:\n\n\u2022 Temperature should not be more than 21 C;\n\n\u2022 Relative Humidity should be 20%-50% RH, Moderate RH of 30-40%;\n\n\u2022 Air should be free from dust, dirt particles or other contaminants, acidic gases, e.g., peroxides sulphur dioxides, ozone, nitrogen dioxide; and\n\n\u2022 Plastic enclosures should be made of polypropylene, polyethylene and box made of acid free and lignin free material.\n\nThe above conditions are prime considerations in the maintenance of the microfilms because almost all our Records Center in the Bureau do not operate their air conditioners on a 24 hour basis.\n\nFor the reasons above stated, it is recommended that we purchase a heavy duty Document Scanner and desktop flatbed scanner with bundled software, compatible operation system and disaster proof external hard drive in lieu of the Microfilm Machine. The estimated cost is more or less Five Hundred Thousand Pesos (Php500,000.00).\n\nFor your information and approval.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) FELISA U.

JACINTO-HENARES\nCommissioner\nBureau of Internal Revenue\nRm. 501/511, BIR National Office Bldg.\nDiliman 1101 Quezon City\n\nDear Commissioner Jacinto-Henares :\n\nFor your information and guidance, we are furnishing your good office the following CESB Circulars:\n\n1. CESB Circular No. 02, Series of 2011, entitled \"Clarification on the Coverage of the Career Executive Service (CES)\"; and\n\n2. CESB Circular No. 03, Series of 2011, entitled \"Revised Policy on Recommendation for original and Promotional Appointment to Career Executive Service (CES) Ranks of Officials with Pending Cases\".\n\nThank you. HIEAcC\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) ARTURO M. LACHICA, CESO II\nOIC-Executive Director\n\nCESB CIRCULAR NO. 002-11\n\nOn May 9, 2009, the Career Executive Service Board issued CESB Resolution No. 799, entitled \"Omnibus Policy on the Coverage of the Career Executive Service\" and circularized in Memorandum Circular No. 3, s. 2009, which classified the following positions as within the coverage of the Career Executive Service (CES), to wit:\n\na. The Career Executive Service includes the positions of Undersecretary, Assistant Secretary, Bureau Director, Assistant Bureau Director, Regional Director (department-wide and bureau-wide), Assistant Regional Director (department-wide and bureau-wide), and Chief of Department Service;\n\nb. Unless provided otherwise, all other managerial or executive positions in the government, including government-owned or controlled corporations with original charters are embraced within the CES provided that they meet the following criteria:\n\ni.) The position is a career position;\n\nii.) The position is above division chief level; and,\n\niii.) The duties and responsibilities of the position require the performance of executive and managerial functions.\n\nSubsequently, on November 23, 2010, the Supreme Court, in the case of PCSO v. CSC, G.R. No. 185766 and G.R. No. 185767, limited the coverage of positions belonging to the CES to positions requiring Presidential appointment. Hence, CES positions have now become synonymous to third level positions by virtue of the said ruling.\n\nIn accordance with this recent jurisprudence, the Board deemed it appropriate to issue the following guidelines to clarify the policy on the coverage of the CES and its classification: TCIDSa\n\n1. For career service positions requiring Presidential appointment expressly enumerated under Section 7 (3), Chapter 2, Subtitle A, Title 1, Book V of the Administrative Code of 1987 namely: Undersecretary, Assistant Secretary, Bureau Director, Assistant Bureau Director, Regional Director, Assistant Regional Director, and Chief of Department Service, no classification of position is necessary to place them under the coverage of the CES, except if they belong to Project Offices, in which case a position classification is required, in consultation with the Department of Budget and Management (DBM).\n\n2. For positions requiring Presidential appointments other than those enumerated above, a classification of positions is necessary which shall be conducted by the Board, upon request of the head of office of the government department/agency concerned, to place them under the coverage of the CES provided they comply with the following criteria:\n\ni.) The position is a career position;\n\nii.) The position is above division chief level; and,\n\niii.) The duties and responsibilities of the position require the performance of executive and managerial functions.\n\nAll appointments to positions which have not been previously classified as part of the CES would be deemed co-terminus with the appointing authority.\n\n3. Positions Excluded from the Coverage of the Career Executive Service. The following executive and managerial positions are excluded from the coverage of the Career Executive Service:\n\na. Managerial and executive positions which have fixed term of office as provided for in the charter of the agency or as specified by law.\n\nb. Managerial and executive positions in the non-career service which include the following:\n\ni. Elective officials and their personal or confidential staff;\n\nii. Secretaries and other officials of cabinet rank who hold their positions at the pleasure of the President and their personal or confidential staff;\n\niii. Chairman and members of commission and boards with fixed terms of office and their personal or confidential staff;\n\niv. Contractual personnel or those whose employment in the government is in accordance with a special contract to undertake a specific work or job; and,\n\nv. Emergency and seasonal personnel.\n\nc. Managerial and executive positions in the national government belonging to the closed career systems which are administered by special bodies such as the Foreign Service, Philippine National Police, State Colleges and Universities unless otherwise provided in their respective charters, the Scientific Career Service and the like.\n\nd. The position of Head Executive Assistant.\n\ne. Managerial and executive positions in local government units.\n\n4. Status of Incumbents of Positions Included Under the Coverage of the CES. Incumbents of positions which are declared to be Career Executive Service positions for the first time pursuant to this Resolution who hold permanent appointments thereto shall remain under permanent status in their respective positions. However, upon promotion, appointment or transfer to other Career Executive Service positions, these incumbents shall be under temporary status in said other Career Executive Service positions until they qualify.\n\n5. Exemption from the coverage in the Career Executive Service. An agency may request the Board that a position be declared a non-CES position if the head of the agency believes that said position does not properly belong in the Career Executive Service. A request for exemption should be filed with the Career Executive Service Board accompanied by appropriate justifications. The Board shall issue a decision on the matter within two (2) months from receipt of such request.\n\nFor information and guidance.\n\nCESB Resolution No. 945 was published on August 15, 2011 in the Official Gazette.\n\n(SGD.) BERNARDO P. ABESAMIS\nChairperson\n\nAttested by:\n\n(SGD.) MARIA ANTHONETTE VELASCO-ALLONES\nExecutive Director\n\nCESB CIRCULAR NO. 003-11\n\nOn May 9, 2009, the Career Executive Service Board issued CESB Resolution No. 798, s. 2009, providing for the guidelines on the appointment to a CES rank of a CESO with pending cases. Under the said rules, the Board recommends a CESO or CES eligible for appointment to a CES rank, even if he/she has pending cases, if after an exhaustive review of the cases, the Board finds that the cases do not involve moral turpitude. TaCDAH\n\nThe Supreme Court, in the case of Villaber vs. COMELEC, G.R. No. 148326 dated November 15, 2001, defined moral turpitude as \"an act of baseness, vileness, or depravity in the private duties which a man owes his fellowmen, or to society in general, contrary to the accepted and customary rule of right and duty between man and woman, or conduct contrary to justice, honesty, modesty, or good morals\".\n\nRecent studies show that a number of officials who are being considered for appointment to CESO rank have pending cases filed against them.\n\nThe Board decided to adopt a Revised Policy on Recommendation for Original and Promotional Appointment to Career Executive Service (CES) Ranks of Officials with Pending Cases, and issued CESB Resolution No. 946 dated June 14, 2011 (Revised Policy on Recommendation for Original and Promotional Appointment to Career Executive Service (CES) Ranks of Officials with Pending Cases), providing the new rules that will govern the original and promotional rank appointment of officials with pending cases, as follows:\n\nRULE I\n\nWith Respect to Cases Pending with the Office of the Ombudsman\n\nSection 1. The Board shall, after an exhaustive evaluation, recommend a CESO or a CES Eligible for appointment to a CES rank even if he/she has pending cases, under the following circumstances:\n\na) If the cases filed do not involve moral turpitude; and\n\nb) Even if the cases filed involve moral turpitude, if the Board has reasonable grounds to believe that the cases are purely harassment cases or constitute malicious prosecution and the acts complained of arose from the performance of official functions.\n\nSection 2. In case of dismissal and/or exoneration from the charges filed, the official concerned shall furnish the Board a copy of the Decision/Order of Dismissal together with a Certification that he/she has no pending criminal or administrative case.\n\nRULE II\n\nWith Respect to Cases Pending with the Regular Courts or Quasi-Judicial Bodies\n\nSection 1. The Board shall, after an exhaustive evaluation, recommend a CESO or a CES Eligible for appointment to a CES rank even if he/she has pending cases, under the following circumstances:\n\na) If the cases filed do not involve moral turpitude; and\n\nb) Even if the cases filed involve moral turpitude, if the Board has reasonable grounds to believe that the cases are purely harassment cases or constitute malicious prosecution and the acts complained of arose from the performance of official functions.\n\nSection 2. In case of dismissal and/or exoneration from the charges filed, the official concerned shall furnish the Board a copy of the Decision/Order of Dismissal together with a Certification that he/she has no pending criminal or administrative case. IDESTH\n\nRULE III\n\nWith Respect to Cases Pending with the Sandiganbayan\n\nSection 1. The Board shall not endorse the appointment to a CES rank of the official concerned until such time that he/she is finally cleared or exonerated from the charges.\n\nFor information and guidance.\n\nCESB Resolution No. 945 was published on August 15, 2011 in the Official Gazette.\n\n(SGD.)

To facilitate the review and evaluation process, particularly on the technical aspects, COA Memorandum No. 91-704 was issued and was later restated and updated by COA Memorandum No. 2005-027, defining the documentary and information requirements, and providing therein the checklists for all types of technical evaluation covered by the memorandum.\n\n1.2 These issuances notwithstanding, it has been observed that management's submission of copies of perfected contracts and supporting documents within the prescribed period had not been complied with and is, at times, lacking in basic supporting documents. In view of these circumstances and the irregularities discovered in government contracts, it has become imperative to reiterate the submission of the requirements to implement a systematic and effective review process with a view of generating timely and relevant audit results.\n\n2.0 Coverage\n\n2.1 This circular shall cover all contracts, purchase orders and the like, entered into by any government agency irrespective of amount involved.\n\n3.0 Submission and Review Process\n\n3.1 Contracts\n\n3.1.1 Within five (5) working days from the execution of a contract by the government or any of its subdivisions, agencies or instrumentalities, including government-owned and controlled corporations and their subsidiaries, a copy of said contract and each of all the documents forming part thereof by reference or incorporation shall be furnished to the Auditor of the agency concerned.

Certificate of Availability of Funds, Obligation Request;\n\nu. Notice to Proceed AaDSTH\n\nv. Such other documents peculiar to the contract and/or to the mode of procurement and considered necessary in the auditorial review and in the technical evaluation thereof.\n\n3.1.3 For technical review purposes, submission of contracts and their supporting documents shall furthermore be guided by the specific documentary requirements outlined in the attached checklist marked as Annexes \"A\" to \"T\" of this circular.\n\n3.1.4 The Auditor shall review the contract within a period ranging from five (5) to twenty (20) working days from receipt, depending on the complexity of the contract. The auditorial review shall consist in the evaluation of compliance with the requirements of applicable laws, rules and regulations, completeness of documentary requirements and an initial evaluation that the contractual covenants are not disadvantageous to the government. Without waiting for the lapse of the period herein established, the Auditor concerned shall call the immediate attention of management regarding defects and deficiencies noted in the contract and suggest such corrective measures as are appropriate and warranted. Where the defect or deficiency is not susceptible of rectification and renders the contract totally or partially void, the head of the agency shall be notified within twenty-four (24) hours from such determination indicating the reasons therein.\n\n3.1.5 Within five (5) working days after the auditorial review, the Auditor shall forward the contract and its supporting documents for technical review to the Technical Audit Specialist (TAS) assigned in the auditing unit/cluster or to the Regional Technical Services Office (RTSO), as the case may be, accompanied by the relevant checklist of documentary requirements mentioned in item 3.1.3 hereof.\n\n3.1.6 The TAS shall complete the technical review thereof as follows:\n\n3.1.7 The procedures and timelines herein outlined shall also apply to supplementary contracts, variation orders and the like.\n\n3.2 Purchase Orders\n\n3.2.1 A copy of any purchase order irrespective of amount, and each and every supporting document, shall, within five (5) working days from issuance thereof, be submitted to the Auditor concerned. Within the same period, the Auditor shall review and point out to management defects and/or deficiencies, if any, in the same manner provided in the second and third sentences of item 3.1.4 hereof. AHTICD\n\n3.2.2 In case of doubt as to the reasonableness of the price of the items purchased, the Auditor shall conduct a canvass thereof making use of price references provided, among others, by legitimate suppliers, the Procurement Service, the Technical Services Office, other government agencies with similar procurement and those posted in the internet.\n\n4.0 Penalty Clause\n\n4.1 Any unjustified failure of the officials and employees concerned to comply with the requirements herein imposed shall be subject to the administrative disciplinary action provided in (a) Section 127 of Presidential Decree No. 1445; (b) Section 55, Title I-B, Book V of the Revised Administrative Code of 1987; and (c) Section 11 of Republic Act No. 6713.\n\n4.2 Upon receipt of information or discovery by the auditor of such failure by management to comply with the required submission, an Audit Observation Memorandum shall be issued by him calling the attention of the latter, and requesting compliance, else the transactions covered by the unsubmitted documents be suspended in audit and the penalty prescribed by law under 4.1 be enforced.\n\n5.0 Repealing Clause\n\nAll COA circulars and memoranda inconsistent herewith are hereby revoked, amended or modified accordingly.\n\n6.0 Effectivity\n\nThis circular shall take effect 15 days after its publication in two (2) newspapers of general circulation in the Philippines.\n\n(SGD.)

KING\nDeputy Commissioner\nResource Management Group\n\nATTACHMENT\n\nDBM CIRCULAR LETTER NO. 12-08\nDecember 12, 2008\n\n1.0 Purpose\n\nThis Circular Letter is being issued to:\n\n1.1 Reiterate the continuing moratorium on the filling of vacant regular/permanent/itemized positions by Departments/Agencies/GOCCs/GFIs of the Executive Branch and the hiring of new casuals/contractuals, including personnel on consultancy/emergency/job order basis, while their respective Rationalization Plan has not yet been approved;\n\n1.2 Extend the authority of Department Secretaries/Agency Heads to renew the appointments of personnel on casual/temporary status and the contracts of personnel under contractual/consultancy/emergency/job order basis for a specific period;\n\n1.3 Prohibit the employment of affected personnel who opted to retire/be separated from the service under E.O. 366 in any agency of the Executive Branch, including in GOCCs/GFIs on a regular, contractual or casual status; and\n\n1.4 Provide the guidelines on the hiring of personnel on consultancy/contract of service/job order basis by agencies whose Rationalization Plans have already been approved by the Department of Budget and Management (DBM), as well as the availment of the incentive package by affected personnel who have reached the compulsory retirement age.\n\n2.0 Guidelines\n\nMoratorium on the Filling of Positions/Hiring of Personnel\n\n2.1 The moratorium on the filling of regular/permanent/itemized positions, either through original appointment, promotion, transfer or reemployment, and the hiring of new casuals/contractuals, including personnel on consultancy/emergency/job order basis, shall continue to be implemented in all Departments/Agencies/GOCCs/GFIs of the Executive Branch whose Rationalization Plan has not yet been approved by this Department, consistent with Section 7 of Executive Order No. 366 and Section 13.a of its Implementing Rules and Regulations.\n\nThe temporary suspension shall not apply to teaching positions, medical and allied medical items in hospitals and other medical facilities servicing agency clients, as well as to uniformed positions in the Departments of National Defense, the Interior and Local Government, Transportation and Communications, and Environment and Natural Resources. However, medical and allied medical positions which primarily provide service to agency personnel are covered by the moratorium.\n\nAuthority to Renew Appointments/Contracts\n\n2.2 Department Secretaries/Agency Heads shall be allowed to renew the appointments of personnel on casual/temporary status and the contracts of personnel under contractual/consultancy/emergency/job order basis for the period that the Department/Agency is undergoing rationalization activities, but not to go beyond one (1) month after the approval of the agency's Rationalization Plan or 30 June 2009, whichever comes earlier, except those personnel whose authorized period of hiring should not go beyond 31 December 2008 and those with specific deliverables for a set timeframe, subject to pertinent budgetary, civil service, accounting and auditing rules and regulations and the following conditions:\n\na. For National Government Agencies, the funds appropriated for the purpose are sufficient and the action would not entail additional budgetary release or realignment of non-Personal Services (PS) funds to PS;\n\nb. In the case of GOCCs, funds for the purpose shall be charged against internally-generated funds/project funds included in the Board-approved Corporate Operating Budget;\n\nc. The maximum number of personnel whose contracts/appointments would be renewed shall not exceed the actual employees at the start of the Department/Agency's rationalization efforts, as adjusted by the DBM-authorized hiring of new/additional personnel; and\n\nd. There shall be no new hiring and/or replacement of resigned/retired separated/terminated/regularized staff.\n\n2.3 The renewal of appointments/contracts of personnel for projects with DBM-approved staffing pattern shall be limited to the existing number of authorized positions and to the set timeframe for hiring.\n\nPolicy on Rehiring of Retired/Separated Personnel\n\n2.4 Government personnel who opted to retire/be separated from the service as a result of the rationalization efforts of their Department/Agency shall not be appointed nor hired as casuals or contractuals in any agency of the Executive Branch, including in GOCCs/GFIs within a period of five (5) years, except in teaching positions in educational institutions and in medical and allied medical items in hospitals. Reemployment in any Branch of Government shall be considered as new entry to the civil service.\n\n2.5 The provision of consultancy services by government personnel who voluntarily retired/separated shall be governed by Section 7 of R.A. 6713 or the Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees dated 20 February 1989 which provides that he/she cannot practice his/her profession in connection with any matter before the office he/she used to be with for a period of one (1) year upon retirement/separation.\n\nPolicy on Hiring of Personnel on Contract of Service/Job Order Basis for Agencies with Approved Rationalization Plan\n\n2.6 The outsourcing of certain services (e.g., utility, building and grounds maintenance, messengerial, security and transportation/mobility) by Departments/Agencies/GOCCs/GFIs with approved Plans shall be consistent with their policy on which services to outsource, as prescribed in their respective approved Plan.\n\nAgencies, however, may explore other areas for outsourcing provided that the funds appropriated for the purpose are sufficient and the action would not entail additional budgetary release.\n\nPolicy on Affected Personnel Who Have Reached the Compulsory Retirement Age\n\n2.7 In case an affected personnel reaches the compulsory retirement age of 65 before the approval of his/her agency Rationalization Plan, he/she must retire on the date of his/her compulsory retirement without incentive.\n\n3.0 Responsibility Clause\n\nIt shall be the responsibility of the Department Secretaries and equivalent Agency Heads to strictly implement the provisions of this Circular Letter. In case of any violation of the provisions of E.O. 366, its Implementing Rules and Regulations and this Circular Letter, the official authorizing such action shall be held responsible for whatever expenses the government incurred for not strictly following the guidelines set forth.\n\n4.0 Applicability Clause\n\nThe provisions of this Circular Letter shall be applicable until revoked.\n\n5.0 Effectivity\n\nThis Circular Letter shall take effect upon its publication in a newspaper of general circulation.\n\n(SGD.)

LEONOR S. VILLALON-ROGERS\nAssistant Commissioner\nHuman Resource & Development Service\nVice-Chairman, Bids and Awards Committee\n\nATTACHMENT\n\nMarch 7, 2008\n\nGPPB CIRCULAR NO. 001-08\n\n1.0 Purpose\n\nThis circular is issued to advise government agencies of the following:\n\n1.1 Implied repeal of Memorandum Circular No. 80, Requiring the Submission of Certain Documents and the Incorporation of Certain Provisions in Security and Janitorial Contract Awards, dated February 10,1994;\n\n1.2 Guiding principles on the adoption of additional eligibility or technical, documents, such as clearances from Social Security System (SSS),Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE),Philippines Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth),and Home Development Mutual Fund/Pag-IBIG, or a certificate from relevant government authority that the bidder has no pending administrative or labor case filed against it for violation of labor laws and other social legislation.\n\n2.0 Republic Act (R.A.) No. 9184 and its Implementing Rules and Regulations Part A (IRR-A) impliedly repealed Memorandum Circular No. 80.\n\n2.1 To ensure compliance with labor laws and other social legislation, Section 25.3 of the IRR-A simply requires the submission of a certificate under oath that the bidder complies with existing labor laws and standards.\n\n2.2 On the other hand, Memorandum Circular No. 80 issued by former Executive Secretary Teofisto T. Guingona, Jr. last February 10, 1994 mandates the submission of the following additional documents: (i) an undertaking to pay their workers at least the minimum wage; (ii) an undertaking to comply with the SSS law on compulsory remittance of SSS premiums; and (iii) a clearance from DOLE and the SSS, as the case may be, that the contractor or bidder has no pending administrative case for violation of the SSS and minimum wage laws, rules and regulations. HAaDcS\n\n2.3 To address the inconsistency between these two provisions, and invoking the repealing clause under Section 76 or R.A. 9184 and Section 75 of its IRR-A; [1] it is opined that Section 25.3 of the IRR-A impliedly repealed Memorandum Circular No. 80.\n\n3.0 Guidelines on the Adoption of Additional Eligibility or Technical Documents to Ensure Compliance with Existing Labor Laws and Other Social Legislation\n\n3.1 As a general policy, imposition of additional eligibility or technical documents is discouraged because it increases transaction cost and reduces competition. Thus, the additional requirement for bidders to submit clearances from DOLE, SSS, PhilHealth, or Pag-IBIG as part of their eligibility or technical documents should be restrained.\n\n3.2 In addition, the requirement that a clearance or certificate be sought from an appropriate government authority that the bidder has no pending administrative or labor case filed against it is violative of due process and thereby prohibited. Every person is presumed innocent until found guilty. Further, this requirement allows any person to disqualify a potential bidder by simply filing a nuisance suit before an administrative or labor court.\n\n3.3 In lieu of the above requirements, however, and in keeping with the policy of ensuring compliance with labor laws and other social legislation, the procuring entity may, during post-qualification, verify, validate and ascertain the statements made by a bidder in its certificate under oath that it complies with existing labor laws and standards. Specifically, the procuring entity may verify whether the bidder \u2014\n\n3.3.1 Complies with the minimum wage mandated by law;\n\n3.3.2 Regularly remits mandated premiums to SSS, PhilHealth, and Pag-IBIG; or\n\n3.3.3 Has been finally adjudged by a court of competent jurisdiction to have violated any labor law or social legislation.\n\nNon-compliance with any one of the above shall be a ground to declare the bidder as \"post-disqualified\".\n\n3.4 Further, to ensure continuing compliance with labor laws and other social legislation, the procuring entity may require submission of said clearances at specified periods during contract implementation.\n\n4.0 This circular shall take effect immediately.\n\n5.0 For guidance. CSIDEc\n\n(SGD.) ROLANDO G. ANDAYA, JR.\nChairperson\n\nPublished in The Manila Times on March 31, 2008.\n\n1. The last sentence of Section 76 of R.A. 9184 and Section 75 ot its IRR-A states: \"Any other law, presidential decree or issuance, executive order, letter of instruction, administrative order, proclamation, charter, rule or regulation and/or parts thereof which are contrary to or inconsistent with the provisions of the Act is hereby repealed, modified or amended accordingly.\"",

Thus, in the procurement of security or janitorial services, the winning bid is determined by the lowest calculated and responsive bid.\n\nIt is recognized, however, that the proper and efficient procurement of security and janitorial services should be based not solely on cost, but should also take into consideration a range of other factors, such as, but not limited to, length of contract, standards of internal governance, adequacy of resources, levels of training, and adherence to labor and other social legislation.\n\n2.0 SCOPE AND APPLICATION\n\nThese guidelines shall govern the procurement of security and janitorial services by government agencies.\n\nThese guidelines shall not apply to the procurement of other general support services, such as, repair and maintenance of equipment and furniture, trucking, hauling, and other services.\n\n3.0 PURPOSE\n\nThese guidelines are formulated to meet the following objectives:\n\n3.1 To prescribe an objective set of parameters in the evaluation of technical proposals for security and janitorial services;\n\n3.2 To provide conditions on the use of multi-year contracts for security and janitorial services.\n\n4.0 ADDITIONAL SET OF TECHNICAL PARAMETERS\n\n4.1 Procuring entities are highly encouraged to evaluate the technical proposal of bidders using the additional set of parameters prescribed in Appendix A of these guidelines. However, considering that procuring entities have different needs and requirements, the minimum standard for each parameter shall be determined by the procuring entity.\n\nAdditional technical parameters and minimum standard for each parameter must be expressly stated under Section VII. Technical Specifications of the Philippine Bidding Documents for the Procurement of Goods (PBDs).\n\n4.2 To determine compliance with these parameters, procuring entity may require additional documents or materials as part of the bidder's technical proposal. These additional documents or materials must be expressly stated in Item 14.1. (j) of the Bid Data Sheet consistent with Item 11, Section 25.3 (A) of the IRR-A of R.A. 9184.\n\n4.3 The procuring entity shall check compliance with the technical parameters using a non-discretionary \"pass/fail\" criteria.\n\n5.0 MULTI-YEAR CONTRACTS\n\nProcuring entities may enter into multi-year contracts, but not to exceed three (3) years, in the procurement of security and janitorial services, subject to the following conditions:\n\n5.1 The Invitation to Apply for Eligibility and to Bid must expressly state the following:\n\n5.1.1 Duration of the contract to be bid, which should not exceed three (3) years;\n\n5.1.2 The Approved Budget for the Contract (ABC) for the first year only.\n\n5.2 All bid prices for a duration of three (3) years shall be fixed and shall not be adjusted during contract implementation, except for the following:\n\n5.2.1 Increase in minimum daily wage pursuant to law or new wage order issued after date of bidding;\n\n5.2.2 Increase in taxes; and\n\n5.2.3 If during the term of the contract the procuring entity sees the need for an increase or decrease in the number of security guards or janitorial attendants, the resulting cost of said increase or decrease, provided that the ABC for the relevant year is not exceeded.\n\nThe procuring entity shall ensure that the foregoing allowable price adjustments are specified under Section 8.1 of the Special Conditions of Contract of the PBDs.\n\n5.3 The Financial Proposal shall contain a breakdown of all costs, including cost of supplies and equipment, necessary for the execution of the contract\n\n5.4 Procuring entities shall expressly provide, under Section VII. Technical Specifications, which shall form part of the contract under Section 13.1 of the General Conditions of the Contract of the PBDs, that the service provider/contractor shall maintain a satisfactory level of performance throughout the term of the contract based on a prescribed set of performance criteria.\n\nThe performance criteria to be applied shall include, among others, the following: (i) quality of service delivered; (ii) time management; (iii) management and suitability of personnel; (iv) contract administration and management; and (v) provision of regular progress reports.\n\n5.5 Before end of each year, procuring entities shall conduct an assessment or evaluation of the performance of the service provider/contractor based on the set of performance criteria prescribed under Section VII. Technical Specifications.\n\n5.6 Based on its assessment, the procuring entity may pre-terminate the contract for failure by the service provider/contractor to perform its obligations thereon following the procedure prescribed under the Guidelines on Termination of Contracts issued by the Government Procurement Policy Board under Resolution No. 018-2004 dated 22 December 2004.\n\n6.0 EFFECTIVITY\n\nThese Guidelines shall take effect fifteen (15) days after its publication in the Official Gazette or in a newspaper of general circulation and upon filing with the University of the Philippines Law Center of three (3) certified copies of these guidelines:\n\nAPPENDIX A\n\nADDITIONAL SET OF TECHNICAL PARAMETERS\n\nA.

Career Executive Officer (CEO) Ranking Structure. \u2014 The rank structure of the CEO is as follows:\n\nAs illustrated above, the highest rank is CEO I while the lowest rank is CEO VI. CEO ranks I, II, and III shall be considered Senior CEO Ranks and incumbents thereof shall be regarded as Senior CEOs.\n\nSECTION 3.  Conferment of a CEO Rank. \u2014 Conferment of appropriate CEO ranks shall be made by the Commission from the roster of CES/CSE/CEO eligibles. The Personnel Policies and Standards Office (PPSO) of the CSC shall serve as the Secretariat of the Commission in the implementation of this policy and shall manage and keep all pertinent records up-to-date. aTcIEH\n\nRULE II\n\nConferment of CEO Rank\n\nSECTION 1.  Conferment of CEO Rank VI. \u2014 CES/CSE/CEO eligibles appointed to a third level executive position in the career service on permanent status (regardless of SG) shall be given the initial rank of CEO VI. The Commission shall confer the rank of CEO VI to a third level executive eligible based on four (4) major criteria, to wit:\n\nSECTION 2.

The Department Secretary or Agency Head shall act upon the request for endorsement within thirty (30) calendar days from the receipt of the request.\n\nShould the Department Secretary or Agency Head fail to act within the prescribed period, the CES/CEO eligible may seek the assistance of the Personnel Policies and Standards Office, CSC, which shall communicate directly with the concerned public official about the matter. If such efforts do not result in the endorsement, the CSC shall waive the endorsement and shall evaluate the qualifications of the candidate and accordingly confer the appropriate rank if found qualified.\n\nRULE III\n\nConferment of Higher CEO Rank\n\nSECTION 1.  Criteria for Conferment of a Higher CEO Rank. \u2014 A CEO may be conferred a higher rank based on the following criteria: SDAaTC\n\na) Experience in a particular rank\n\nb) Completion of required training program from duly recognized training institutions\n\nc) Performance rating in the CESPES\n\nSECTION 2.

TEVES\nSecretary\nDepartment of Finance\nBSP Complex, Roxas Blvd., Manila\n\nDear Secretary Teves,\n\nPresident Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo has given instruction during one of the meetings on the \"Landslide of Southern Leyte\" for the Department of Health (DOH) to spearhead in the development of a system in managing the dead and missing persons during disasters. In order to institutionalize the Philippine System on the Management of the Dead and Missing Persons During Emergencies and Disasters, the DOH through a Multi-Sectoral Technical Working Group had a series of consultative meetings and workshops that came up with the development of the National Policy on the Management of the Dead and Missing Persons (MDM) During Emergencies and Disasters based on the five (5) major activities of MDM namely search and rescue, identification of the dead, final arrangements/disposition of the dead, management of the missing person and the assistance to the bereaved. ADHCSE\n\nWe would like to express our deepest appreciation to your department for the active participation and contribution of your representatives through the Insurance Commission during the development and finalization of the policy now a signed Administrative Order No. 2007-0018 dated July 4, 2007 \u2014 National Policy on the Management of the Dead and Missing Persons (MDM) During Emergencies and Disasters.\n\nWe wish also to inform you that we have sent a letter to Secretary Gilberto Teodoro, Chairman, National Disaster Coordinating Council (NDCC) a copy of the Administrative Order on MDM requesting for an issuance and dissemination of an NDCC order for the observance and compliance of its implementation by all those involved in MDM during emergencies and disasters as well as the rest of the member agencies of the NDCC. aIHCSA\n\nIn this regard, we are furnishing your Office an advance copy of the mentioned Administrative Order for your information and also requesting your support that this Administrative Order be disseminated and implemented accordingly by your department and attached agencies.\n\nWe look forward to your favorable response on this matter. IcADSE\n\nThank you for your continuous support to all our endeavors. Warm regards.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) FRANCISCO T. DUQUE III, MD, MSc\nSecretary\n\nJuly 4, 2007\n\nDOH ADMINISTRATIVE ORDER NO. 018-07\n\nSUBJECT : National Policy on the Management of the Dead and the Missing Persons During Emergencies and Disasters\n\nI. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n\nIn emergency or disaster management, most efforts are being concentrated on the management of the living victims while very least considerations are being given to the dead and the missing to the extent that there are no clear specific tasks and assigned agencies to handle them. The major disasters in the past years like the World Trade Center Tragedy in New York, U.S.A. in 2001, the Tsunami Incidents in Indonesia and Thailand in 2004, where hundreds of thousands died and missing and in the Philippines, the Quezon Flood in 2004, as well as the Landslide in Southern Leyte in 2006, where number of deaths and missing reached the score of hundreds or thousands. This served as eye opener to the affected governments to shift their concerns not only in the management of the living victims but to the management of the dead and the missing (MDM) persons as well. Reality proved that the MDM in disasters must be a major component of the over-all management of consequences of disasters. Like in most countries of Asia and the Pacific the problem of MDM during disasters had been given little attention so that countries like the Philippines were not ready to cope with this burden. Capacity of the staff in these countries, legal implications, facilitation of necessary documents and coordination arrangements need to be put in place with the primary objective of institutionalizing the MDM within the health sector as an integral component of the National Disaster Management Program.\n\nRecent statistics show that after series of typhoon and landslide disasters many have died and there are relatives still hoping to retrieve their loved ones. In Quezon Flood in 2004 alone, there were 645 deaths and thousands were missing, while in Guinsaugon Landslide in 2006, it resulted to 139 deaths, 15 recovered body parts and almost thousand persons reported missing.\n\nThe government has a critical role in standardizing and guiding the tasks of handling the dead bodies (recovery, identification, transfer and final disposal), ensuring that legal norms are followed, and guaranteeing that the dignity of the deceased and their families is respected in accordance with their cultural values and religious beliefs.\n\nThis policy shall be very useful for authorities and other actors responsible for disaster prevention and response to avoid controversy on handling mass fatalities and effectively manage corpses and preserve the dignity of those who have passed.\n\nII. OBJECTIVES\n\nA. General\n\nTo provide a national policy framework as a guide to an efficient and a well coordinated action in managing the dead and the missing persons during emergencies and disasters.\n\nB. Specific\n\n1. To strengthen the coordination and collaboration among the partner agencies and stakeholders in the MDM;\n\n2. To provide standards, guidelines, systems and procedures to institutionalize the preparedness and response activities of the health sector and other partner agencies in the MDM; and HIEASa\n\n3. To establish resource-sharing mechanism among the key players in the MDM.\n\nIII. SCOPE AND COVERAGE\n\nThis policy shall apply to all Department of Health offices including its attached agencies. It shall likewise apply to the other authorities/stakeholders/agencies at all levels and all disciplines, institutions, government, non-government, and private organizations whose functions and activities contribute to the management of the dead and the missing persons during emergencies and disasters.\n\nIV.

Goals are not constrained by time or existing resources and need not be quantified or measured. While the objectives are measurable state that is expected to exist at a pre-determined place and time as a result of the application of a specified procedure and resources, the result of which is progress towards the achievement of goals. They are quantifiable and measurable, thus, they are the basis of evaluation and monitoring process. The goal and objective consists of the purpose of the plan/activity from the broader to more specific perspective or outcomes.\n\nd. Planning group \u2014 Consist of group of authorized key players/implementer or representatives from the major stakeholders/agencies that participate in a planning activity relevant to the set goals and objectives.\n\ne. Risk assessment \u2014 a process of analyzing, anticipating or defining the possible visible outputs or consequences of hazard once it has affected the community. It includes hazard, vulnerability and risk analysis. This is the basis in developing the preparedness plan of the community.\n\nf. Management Structures \u2014 Structure in the management that shows the specific chain of a command, control, and coordination. It implies the flow of reporting, coordination and communication. It reflects the roles, functions and responsibilities of all the key players involved. These structures in the management are best expressed through the use of diagrams.\n\ng.

It should be noted that said income received by/paid to such employees in their home countries are exempt from taxation in their home countries, but are taxable here in the Philippines where they are rendering the services.\n\nIn view of the foregoing, you are hereby directed to conduct a comprehensive verification on the withholding tax compliance of all corporations, especially subsidiaries of multinationals and other similarly situated organizations, with the purpose of determining the following:\n\na. Number of seconded employees in these corporations and their taxability;\n\nb.

Whether or not the correct amount of taxes has been withheld on such income/s. aAHDIc\n\nFollowing the gathering of such information on seconded employees, you (except Large Taxpayers Service [LTS]) are to investigate the income tax returns of the aforesaid individuals who are registered taxpayers within your respective jurisdiction, to verify whether or not the correct amount of taxes due on their said income received have been properly paid. The information gathered by the LTS on the abovementioned individuals shall be submitted to the Office of the Commissioner not later than May 30, 2007.\n\nRegional Directors, are required to submit a summary report of investigation on this matter to the Office of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, copy furnished the Deputy Commissioner \u2014 Operations Group, not later than June 30, 2007.

ATTY. JAMES H. ROLDAN\nAssistant Commissioner\nLegal Service\n\nATTACHMENT\n\nOctober 6, 2006\n\nBIR RULING NO. 010-06\n\n40(C) (b)\n\nBank of Commerce\nPhil. First, 6764 Ayala Avenue\nMakati City\n\nAttention: Mr. Raul de Mesa\nPresident\n\nGentlemen :\n\nThis refers to your letter dated August 8, 2006 requesting in effect for a ruling on the taxability of Bank of Commerce (Bancommerce for brevity) relative to its purchase of certain identified recorded assets of Traders Royal Bank (hereinafter referred to as TRB) in consideration of the assumption of certain identified recorded liabilities of TRB.\n\nRecords show that TRB (now Royal Traders Holdings Co., Inc.) was a commercial bank established and existed under and by virtue of the laws of the Republic of the Philippines. Its banking operation has been uncertain for years and this necessitated TRB to sell some of its properties to Bancommerce. Consequently, the parties executed a Purchase and Sale Agreement on November 9, 2001.\n\nThe Purchase and Sale Agreement states that \"TRB desires to sell and Bancommerce desires to purchase identified recorded assets of TRB in consideration of Bancommerce assuming identified recorded liabilities of TRB including booked contingent accounts per Consolidated Statement of Condition as of August 31, 2001, subject to adjustment at the closing date as may be agreed upon by Bancommerce and TRB and subject further to the approval of Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) and Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation (PDIC).\"\n\nWith respect to the assumption of liabilities of TRB, Article II of the same Agreement provides:\n\n\"In consideration of the sale of recorded assets and properties covered by this Agreement, BANCOMMERCE shall assume identified recorded TRB's liabilities including booked contingent liabilities as listed and referred to in its Consolidated Statement of Condition as of August 31, 2001, in the total amount of PESOS: TEN BILLION FOUR HUNDRED ONE MILLION FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY SIX THOUSAND (P10,401,436,000.00), provided that the liabilities so assumed shall not include: CcAESI\n\n1. Liability for the payment of compensation, retirement pay, separation benefits and any labor benefit whatsoever arising from incidental to, or connected with employment in, or rendition of employee services to TRB, whether permanent, regular, temporary, casual or contractual.\n\n2. Items in litigation, both actual and prospective, against TRB which include but are not limited to the following:\n\n2.1 Claims of sugar planters for alleged undervaluation of sugar export sales coursed through TRB; particularly the case entitled Lopez, et al. vs. Traders Royal Bank, et al. docketed as Civil Case No. 00-11178, Bacolod Regional Trial Court, Branch 41 and Lacson, et al. vs. Benedicto et al., originally docketed as Civil Case 95-9137, Bacolod Regional Trial court, Branch 44 now pending appeal before the Supreme Court under S.C. G.R. No. 141508, and other related cases which might be filed in connection therewith;\n\n2.2 Claims of the Republic of the Philippines for peso-denominated certificates supposed to have been placed by the Marcos family with TRB:\n\n2.3 Other liabilities not included in said Consolidated Statement of Condition; and\n\n2.4 Liabilities accruing after the effectivity date of this Agreement that were not incurred in the ordinary course of business.\"\n\nOn November 8, 2001, the Monetary Board of Bangko Sentral Ng Pilipinas (BSP) approved the purchase and assumption of the identified recorded assets and liabilities of TRB. It is noted that TRB retained its corporate existence and it is now known as \"Royal Traders Holding Company, Inc.\". Bancommerce did not absorb the employees of TRB as they were all retired and their retirement benefits were paid by the latter. Moreover, it did not issue or exchange its shares of stock for the assets acquired from TRB because the consideration was the assumption of specified recorded liabilities of TRB.\n\nThe above transaction was considered as a merger by the Bureau of Internal Revenue when it made a reply to the letter of Atty. Dominador Santiago's request for opinion relating to the same set of facts. Thus, the Bureau concluded that the Purchase and Sale Agreement between TRB and Bancommerce is a \"merger\" citing as basis thereto Section 80 of the Corporation Code of the Philippines. In concluding that the said transaction is a merger, the Bureau stated in closing that \"Bancommerce cannot excuse itself from the obligations and liabilities (of TRB) on the theory that said corporations are distinct and separate.\" (Citing Rivera vs. Litam & Co., Inc., 4 SCRA 1072, April 1962). Stating further, \"Bancommerce cannot close its eyes to answer for the deficiency taxes being assessed and collected by the BIR per Collection Letter dated September 13, 2004.\" (BIR Ruling No. DA-045-2005 dated January 28, 2005).\n\nOn the other hand, Bancommerce has been selling real estate assets acquired from TRB but the BIR Revenue District Offices from where the respective Certificate Authorizing Registration (CAR) is being sought refused to issue the CAR unless Bancommerce settles the pending tax assessments issued against TRB which the latter claims the same to be enforceable against Bancommerce by reason of the merger. HETDAC\n\nAs a consequence of such refusal, the buyers of these real estate assets have filed complaint against Bancommerce with the BSP and have sent demand letters to Bancommerce threatening to file suits for damages.\n\nIn view of the urgency of the matter, you now request for a ruling on the following concerns:\n\n1. There was no merger, de facto or otherwise, since the facts upon which the 2005 ruling was issued were not properly and accurately presented, hence the ruling should be set aside.\n\n2. Since there was no merger, the tax deficiency assessment against TRB cannot be enforced against Bancommerce, not being one of those liabilities expressly and specifically assumed by Bancommerce under the Purchase and Sale Agreement of November 9, 2001, and that the respective RDOs be directed to issue the CARs upon payment of the capital gains, documentary stamp and other taxes that may apply to the purchase of the assets from Bancommerce by the buyers without requiring Bancommerce to settle the tax assessments against TRB.\n\nIn reply, please be informed of the following:\n\n1. Section 40(C)(b) of the Tax Code of 1997 defines merger as follows:\n\n\"(b) The term \"merger\" or \"consolidation\", when used in this Section, shall be understood to mean: (1) the ordinary merger or consolidation, or (ii) the acquisition by one corporation of all or substantially all of the properties of another corporation solely for stock; provided that for a transaction to be regarded as a merger or consolidation within the purview of this Section, it must be undertaken for a bona fide business purpose and not solely for the purpose of escaping the burden of taxation; . . . .\"\n\nOne distinctive characteristic for a merger to exist under the second part of the aforequoted provision is that, it is not enough for a corporation to acquire all or substantially all the properties of another corporation but it is also necessary that such acquisition is solely for stock of the absorbing corporation. Stated differently, the acquiring corporation will issue a block of shares equal to the net asset value transferred, which stocks are in turn distributed to the stockholders of the absorbed corporation in proportion to their respective share.\n\nAfter a careful perusal of the facts presented as well as the details of the instant case, it is observed by this Office that the transaction was purely concerning acquisition and assumption by Bancommerce of the recorded liabilities of TRB. The Agreement did not mention with respect to the issuance of shares of stock of Bancommerce in favor of the stockholders of TRB. Such transaction is absent of the requisite of a stock transfer and same belies the existence of a merger. As such, this Office considers the Agreement between Bancommerce and TRB as one of \"a sale of assets with assumption of liabilities\" rather than \"merger\".\n\nGenerally, where one corporation sells or otherwise transfers all its assets to another corporation, the latter is not liable for the debts and liabilities of the transferor. (Edward J. Niel Co. vs. Pacific Farms, Inc., 15 SCRA 415). But, if in the agreement, the corporation that acquired the assets and properties, assumed the obligations and liabilities, the acquiring corporation cannot excuse itself from said obligations and liabilities on the theory that said corporations are distinct and separate. (Rivera vs. Litam & Co., Inc., 4 SCRA 1072) In a sale of assets, the acquiring corporation \u2014 barring fraud of creditors \u2014 need assume only those obligations set forth explicitly in the agreement. (see H. de Leon, The Corporation Code of the Philippines, 1999 Edition, p. 627) EaScHT\n\nIn the case at bar, Bancommerce purchased identified recorded assets and properties of TRB. In consideration thereof, Bancommerce assumed certain liabilities of TRB which were identified in the Consolidated Statement of Condition as of August 31, 2001. In this wise, the liabilities of TRB assumed by Bancommerce were limited only to those already identified as of August 31, 2001 amounting in all to Ten Billion Four Hundred One Million Four Hundred Thirty Six Thousand Pesos (P10,401,436,000.00). (See attached Consolidated Statement of condition which shall form part of this ruling and mark as Annex \"A\") More so, liabilities that were not assumed by Bancommerce should not be enforced against it. And this includes, at this instance, the tax assessment against Royal Traders Holdings Co., Inc. for taxable year 2000 (issued under the new corporate name of TRB) involving the aggregate amount of P66,845,571.81.\n\nIn line with the preceding discussion, the internal revenue tax assessment graphically described below, viz.:\n\nYear Covered: 2000 Date Issued: 12/12/2003\n\nAss./Demand Nos. GRT-00-000025 / EWT-00-000092 / FT-00-000033\n\ncannot be charged against Bancommerce because the 2000 deficiency tax assessment has not been determined yet as of the time of the signing of the agreement. Therefore, it would be unreasonable and unjust to hold Bancommerce liable for the foregoing assessment considering that it did not intend to assume the same. The nature of deficiency taxes involved are direct taxes which can solely be assessed directly against TRB.\n\nConsidering the above presentation, BIR Ruling No. DA-045-2005 dated January 28, 2005 is hereby revoked and considered not having been issued. The same, however, should be looked into as a shield that temporarily sheltered TRB from the collection process that should have been executed by the BIR. In addition to the discussion in the preceding paragraphs, the ruling failed to ascertain the extent of liabilities to be assumed by Bancommerce. Otherwise stated, the ruling has failed to indicate the composition of the liabilities assumed as mentioned in the Purchase and Sale Agreement that caused confusion, particularly, in the issuance of the Assessment Notices. In short therefore, no merger ever existed by virtue of the Purchase and Sale Agreement between TRB and Bancommerce.\n\n2. Much have been said that the transaction between TRB and Bancommerce is not a merger within the contemplation of Section 40(C)(b) of the Tax Code of 1997. To reiterate, this Office has ruled in the foregoing discussion that the transaction is one of sale of assets with assumption of identified recorded liabilities of TRB. As such, the liabilities assumed by Bancommerce amounted only to P10,401,436,000.00 with some enumerated exclusion in the Agreement. Yet, it did not include deficiency taxes that may be imposed by the BIR because such liability was not yet determined at the time of the execution of the Agreement. As aptly said, it would be unreasonable and unjust to hold Bancommerce liable for the deficiency assessment against TRB in which Bancommerce did not expressly assume in the Agreement.\n\nAs this Office has already concluded that the Purchase and Sale Agreement between TRB and Bancommerce did not result to a merger, and that the deficiency assessment cannot be enforced against Bancommerce, the processing and/or issuance of the Certificate Authorizing Registration (CAR) on the sale by Bancommerce of the real properties included in the Purchase and Sale Agreement, should now be undertaken by the respective Revenue District Offices. These, of course, after payment of the corresponding taxes that may have accrued on the purchase of the assets from Bancommerce by the buyers and should not be conditioned upon payment of the deficiency tax assessment issued against TRB. TSacID\n\nThis ruling is being issued on the basis of the foregoing facts as represented. However, if upon investigation, it will be disclosed that the facts are different, then this ruling shall be considered null and void.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.) JOSE MARIO C.

VIRGINIA L.

JUDITH D. CHICANO\nDirector IV\nCommission Secretariat and Liaison Office\n\nOFFICE OF COMMISSIONER CESAR D. BUENAFLOR\n\nOCOM-C Memo No. 21, s. 2005\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nWith all due respect, for reasons of the principle of meritocracy enshrined in the Constitution and the rationale for the institutionalization of the masteral degree programs in various graduate schools under the oversight functions of the Commission on Higher Education, I am not inclined to support the proposed policy due to the divergent underlying principles involved in the afore-cited subjects. The main reason or function for the existence or requirement of Meritocracy and masteral degree is quite different and diverse.\n\nSpecifically, the reasons stated in the 7th and 8th WHEREASES of the proposed draft resolution, while meritorious to a certain degree are insufficient to support the proposed policy in the light of the differing operating principles applicable to each of the subject matter.\n\nTo underscore the point, eligibility is a Constitutional requirement based on (2), Sec. 2, Art. IX, of the Constitution which states\" THAT APPOINTMENTS IN THE CIVIL SERVICE SHALL BE MADE ONLY ACCORDING TO MERIT AND FITNESS TO BE DETERMINED, AS FAR AS PRACTICABLE, . . ., BY COMPETITIVE.\n\nWhile masteral degrees are formal education based on programs offered by accredited educational institutions authorized by law to grant masteral degrees based on approved curriculum for the purpose of acquiring higher specialization in the field of endeavor.\n\nLastly, (1) and (2), Sec. 22, Chapter 5, Book V, E.O. 292 provide, thus:\n\n1. A qualification standard expresses the minimum requirements for a class of positions in terms of education, training and experience, civil service eligibility, physical fitness, and other qualities required for successful performance.\n\n2. The establishment, administration and maintenance of qualification standards shall be the responsibility of the department or agency, with the assistance and approval of the Civil Service Commission and in consultation with the Wage and Position Classification Office.\n\nIn fine, unless provided by law or authorized therein, to consider 3rd level eligibility equivalent to a master's degree for permanent appointment in the career service would not sit well with the definition and requirement of the afore-quoted provisions of law on the Qualification Standards since it enumerated distinctly education and civil service eligibility as separate requirements. Otherwise, it may be said that a masteral degree may be equivalent to a 3rd level eligibility.\n\nFor judicious consideration by the Commission.\n\n(SGD.) CESAR D. BUENAFLOR\nCommissioner\n\nAugust 23, 2005.\n\nPublished in The Manila Times on August 2, 2006.",

FERNANDEZ-MENDOZA, CESO I\nExecutive Director\n\nMarch 20, 2006\n\nCESB RESOLUTION NO. 619-06\n\nOMNIBUS RESOLUTION EXPRESSING GRAVE CONCERN ON PERSONNEL ACTIONS IN VIOLATION OF CESB AND CSC LAWS, RULES AND REGULATIONS\n\nWHEREAS, in her speech on January 22, 2001 at the Flag Raising Rites in Malaca\u00f1ang entitled: \"Let Us Work Together in Building the Nation\", President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo emphasized, among others, the three (3) pillars of good governance, namely: 1.) A sound, moral foundation; 2.) A philosophy of transparency; and, 3.) An ethic of effective implementation, which all government workers should uphold. The President also recalled her father's advice, \"respect the bureaucracy, respect the civil service\" which she committed to \" . . . bring to the Office of the President and Malaca\u00f1ang\";\n\nWHEREAS, a Career Executive Service (CES) has been created under the Integrated Reorganization Plan (IRP) approved by Presidential Decree No. 1, as amended, to form a continuing pool of well-selected and development oriented career administrators who shall provide competent and faithful service;\n\nWHEREAS, as explained by the Commission on Reorganization, the creation of the CES is intended to prevent the filling-up of higher administrative positions on considerations other than merit and demonstrated competence, i.e., that senior administrators shall be carefully selected on the basis of high qualifications and competence, skilled in both techniques and processes of management;\n\nWHEREAS, the above considerations are clearly intended to professionalize the third level executives of the bureaucracy thereby writing finis' to the pernicious practice of the \"spoils system\" of the past;\n\nWHEREAS, Part III, Article IV of the IRP created the Career Executive Service Board (CESB) to serve as the governing body of the CES with the power to promulgate rules, standards and procedures on selection, classification, compensation and career development of members of the CES;\n\nWHEREAS, Book V, Title I A, Chapter 2, Sections 6, 7, and 9 of the Administrative Code of 1987 provides that the civil service, which embraces all branches, subdivisions, instrumentalities, and agencies of the government, including government-owned and controlled-corporations with original charters, is classified into career service which is characterized by entrance base on merit and fitness, opportunity for advancement to higher career positions, and security of tenure and non-career service, that is characterized by entrance on bases other than those of the usual tests of merit and fitness utilized for the career service; and tenure which is limited to a period specified by law, or which is coterminous with that of the appointing authority or subject to his pleasure, or which is limited to the duration of a particular project for which purpose employment was made;\n\nWHEREAS, Book V, Title I A, Chapter 2, Section 3 of the same Code provides that the Career Executive Service covers the positions of Undersecretary, Assistant Secretary, Bureau Directors, Assistant Bureau Directors, Regional Directors, Assistant Regional Directors, Chief of Department Service and other officers of equivalent rank as may be identified by the CESB, all of whom are appointed by the President;\n\nWHEREAS, under Office of the President (OP) Memorandum Circular No. 796 dated January 17, 1975, a ranking structure as recommended by the CESB, was approved establishing CESO ranks I to V corresponding to the positions above referred to;\n\nWHEREAS, under OP Memorandum Order No. 372 dated July 3, 1991, the ranking structure was modified by adding CESO rank VI and prescribing the Salary Grade corresponding to each rank;\n\nWHEREAS, under a policy previously implemented by the Board, CES eligibles were automatically recommended for appointment to ranks appropriate to their respective positions, which policy was cited by the Supreme Court in the case of Secretary of Justice v. Bacal, G.R. No. 139382, dated December 6, 2000 as basis for security of tenure in the CES;\n\nWHEREAS, the automatic grant of CESO rank gave rise to inequities among members of the CES who rose from the CESO ranks as against the lateral entry of political protegees who immediately got their ranks by virtue of their positions despite lack of adequate managerial preparations therefor;\n\nWHEREAS, under policy reforms initiated by the Board, CESB Resolution No. 453 s. 2002 was promulgated dissociating original and promotional appointments to CESO ranks from appointment to CES positions whereby irrespective of the CES position held by its incumbent, original appointment to CESO rank shall initially be at CESO rank VI and that promotional appointment in CESO ranks, irrespective of CES position held, shall be on the basis of broad levels of responsibility; personal qualifications; and, demonstrated competence;\n\nWHEREAS, in CESB Resolution No. 548 s. 2004, the Board adopted a policy that in lieu of security of tenure based on CESO ranks, the attainment of CES eligibility by an incumbent of a CES position is sufficient to enjoy security of tenure in the CES, in conformity with the pertinent policies of the Civil Service Commission for third level qualified incumbents;\n\nWHEREAS, concomitant to the security of tenure of CES members, Part III, Article IV 5 e of the IRP provides that, \"members of the CES may be reassigned or transferred from one position to another provided that such reassignment or transfer is made in the interest of public service and involves no reduction in rank or salary . . .;\"\n\nWHEREAS, Book V, Subtitle A, Chapter 5, Section 27 (2) of the Administrative Code of 1987, provides that: in the absence of appropriate eligibles and it becomes necessary in the public interest to fill a vacancy, a temporary appointment shall be issued to a person who meets all the requirements for the position to which he is being appointed except the appropriate civil service eligibility: However, such temporary appointment shall not exceed twelve (12) months, but the appointee may be replace sooner if a qualified civil service eligible becomes available;\n\nWHEREAS, under the IRP mandate that appointment to appropriate classed of position in the Career Executive Service shall be made by the President from a list of career executive eligibles recommended by the Board and in accordance with the above-cited provision of the Code, CESB Resolution No. 408 s. 2002 was promulgated wherein appointment and/or promotion to CES positions shall be in accordance with the following policy:\n\n1. The CES eligibility conferred by the Career Executive Service Board is a requirement for appointment to and/or promotion of any person to a position in the CES;\n\n2. A CESO or CES eligible shall be given priority in an appointment to a vacant CES position;\n\n3. In exceptional cases where the President or the appropriate appointing authority may appoint a non-CES eligible to a CES position, such appointment shall be temporary in nature and shall not exceed twelve (12) months. Upon appointment to a CES position, a non-CES eligible or non-CESO shall be required to subsequently take the CES eligibility examinations;\n\n4. The President or appropriate appointing authority may issue promotional appointment to a higher CES position, provided, that no CES eligible is available and qualified for such higher CES position as certified by the CESB. Provided further, that such promotional appointment of a non-CESO shall be temporary in nature and shall not exceed twelve (12) months unless the appointee subsequently acquires CES eligibility and appointed by the President to CES rank;\n\nWHEREAS, the rule on temporary appointments has been enshrined in several landmark cases decided by the Supreme Court (Achacoso v. Macaraig, G.R. No. 93023 dated March 13, 1993; Pangilinan v. Maglaya, G.R. No. 104216 dated August 20, 1993). The CSC, in MC No. 20 s. 2002 and MC No. 9 s. 2005, reiterated the same rule with the limitation, among others, that only one renewal of a temporary third level appointment shall be allowed; provided there are no qualified applicants actually available and willing to assume the position;\n\nWHEREAS, an inventory conducted by the Board revealed that of the 2,583 CES positions 2,122 positions are occupied of which only 1,227 or 58% have third level eligibilities while the remaining 895 or 42% are filled-up by non-eligibles;\n\nWHEREAS, the Board is alarmed by personnel actions \u2014 affecting CESOs and/or third level eligibles \u2014 that have transgressed the above laws, rules and regulations thereby undermining the principles of professionalism and meritocracy. Some of these are:\n\na. A department undersecretary who was terminated via a thank you letter but subsequently ordered transferred to another department;\n\nb. A government corporate executive who was eased out and replaced by a non-eligible outsider;\n\nc. CESOs who were placed on \"floating\" status;\n\nd. CESOs who were relieved from their CES positions and replaced by non-eligibles;\n\ne. CESOs who were relieved from their CES positions and demoted to non-CES positions;\n\nf. Appointments of non-CESOs/non-eligibles to CES positions despite the availability of CESOs and/or third level eligibles ready and willing to occupy said positions; and,\n\ng. Creation of excess undersecretary and assistant secretary positions as well as designations of political appointees to career positions which are detrimental to the government and demoralizing to members of the career service;\n\nWHEREAS, the Board views with much concern the apparent politicization of the career service as shown in the letter of the Chair of the OP Search Committee to the Secretary of the DOTC dated January 31, 2006 stating that \". . . a non-CES eligible occupying a CES position is deemed as a political appointee who serves at the pleasure of the President;\"\n\nWHEREAS, the above transgressions, among others, have resulted in growing apprehension and demoralization among the members of the CES, which can only further erode the institutional foundations of a professional bureaucracy;\n\nWHEREFORE, foregoing premises considered, the Board RESOLVES, as it is hereby RESOLVED to express its grave concern on the obvious disregard of pertinent Career Executive Service Board and Civil Service Commission laws, rules and regulations in the above-cited instances: RESOLVED FURTHER, that all departments and agencies, in the interest of meritocracy and professionalism in the CES, are hereby enjoined to comply with the above stated rules: RESOLVED FURTHERMORE, that:\n\n1. In accordance with Section 2 (3), Article IX-B of the 1987 Constitution, no officer or employee of the civil service shall be removed or suspended except for cause provided by laws. Thus, security of tenure based on eligibility should be respected;\n\n2. All concerned are reminded and enjoined to comply with the conditions embodied in the rule on the reassignment or transfer of members of the CES namely:\n\na. That such reassignment or transfer is made in the interest of public service;\n\nb. That it involves no reduction in rank or salary including such other benefits, allowances and privileges received prior to their reassignment or transfer; and,\n\nc. That no member of the CES shall be reassigned or transferred oftener that every two (2) years.\n\n3. A \"floating\" status accorded a CES member is not within the purview of the rule on reassignment and transfer in the CES. Accordingly, to ensure compliance with the above-quoted rule, reassignment or transfer of CESOs shall be effected only upon the availability of the corresponding position;\n\n4. Non-career officials occupying CES positions are prohibited from exercising control or supervision over regular and career personnel of a department or agency as this practice usually results in protracted disputes in the workplace and demoralization of the latter which are prejudicial to public service;\n\n5. A presidential appointee to a CES position who lacks the appropriate eligibility requirement may only be issued a temporary appointment, which shall not exceed twelve (12) months with only one renewal of said temporary appointment provided that the appointee may be replaced sooner if a qualified third level eligible becomes actually available.\n\n6. Presidential appointees to CES positions who come from the career service but do not have the eligibility required should be clearly appointed with a temporary status while appointees not from the career service shall be classified as coterminous with the appointing authority; and,\n\n7. These appointed to third level positions outside the approved Department of Budget and Management plantilla of personnel of a department or agency shall not be classified to be within the coverage of the CES, hence, occupants thereof shall be considered as on a coterminous status of appointment.\n\nRESOLVED FINALLY that copies of this omnibus resolution be furnished to the Office of the President, Civil Service Commission, Commission on Audit, departments/agencies and all organizations of government officials and employees.\n\nAPPROVED this 20th day of March 2006 in Quezon City, Philippines.\n\n(SGD.)

                                    "Details": "Please find attached, a copy of privilege speech delivered by Congressman Herminio G. Teves, which outlines some measures that may be useful in our efforts to intensify revenue collections. We need to work harder to successfully hurdle the challenge of achieving our revenue goal, particularly this year as we fully implement the Reformed Value Added Tax. In this regard, we welcome your suggestions on how the DOF can better assist the BIR effectively implement these measures.\n\nThank you.\n\n(SGD.) GARY B. TEVES\nSecretary\n\nATTACHMENT\n\nA Personal and Collective Privilege Speech on Revenue Generation and On the Term-Sharing Agreement at the Committee on Ways & Means\nBy: Cong. Herminio G. Teves\nFebruary 13, 2006\n\nMr. Speaker, fellow members of this august body, I rise on a Personal and Collective Privilege on the matter of revenue generation and the term-sharing agreement of the Chairmanship at the Committee on Ways & Means.\n\nThis representation served diligently as Senior Vice Chairman of said committee in the 11th, 12th and now the 13th Congress. I have always been passionate about revenue generation. I believe that it is only through higher revenues that we can balance the budget and reduce our dependence on borrowings. But the tax laws that we pass in this chamber are for naught because so much revenue per type of tax escape the tax net due to systemic failure and graft in the country's main tax collection agencies, the Bureau of Internal Revenue and the Bureau of Customs. SACHcD\n\nI have fervently proposed several measures that are designed to reduce or minimize corruption in our revenue collection as well as address several systemic errors at the BIR. I personally believe that with these proposed measures we will be able to maximize revenue take and thereby, achieve a balanced budget the soonest possible time.\n\nA cornerstone proposal from this representation is the deletion of the secrecy and confidentiality provisions in tax payments under the 1997 Tax Code. This will help institute transparency and reduce connivance between taxpayers and tax collectors. Said connivance is the biggest source of graft and has already been draining the government coffers for quite a long time.\n\nI also proposed to President Arroyo that an Executive Task Force be created to estimate potential revenue per type of tax, such as individual income tax, corporate income tax, value added tax, excise tax, etc., and another Task Force that will undertake audit on collection vis-\u00e0-vis potential revenues. Nobody is currently mandated to audit revenue collection, not even the Commission on Audit (COA).\n\nOn the excise tax of sin products, the DOF advocated for the reclassification of brands based on current market prices to generate a revenue of P27.7 billion. The World Health Organization recommended that cigarettes must be taxed high (similar to other countries) to make it prohibitively expensive so as to generate revenue and curb smoking harmful to health especially among the youth. President GMA herself` made a public pronouncement that \"there is need to address the harmful effects of the so-called sin products\" by instituting an adjustment in the tax rates therein vis-\u00e0-vis the actual market retail price.\n\nCongress, however, watered down the proposed indexation of sin taxes and instead approved a mere 20% increase in the tax rates. This representation voted 'No' to this watered down version. Thus, he was excluded in the bicameral committee on the said tax measure, after which I published an article on the subject \"How serious are we in raising revenue for our government\" Mr. Speaker, respected colleagues, actual revenue collection from the Sin Tax Law registered at a dismal P2.96 billion last year, 80% short from the projected P15 billion additional revenue from this tax measure. (Business World, February 2, 2006)\n\nChairman Lapus designated this Representation as Chair of the sub-committee on oversight. Immediately thereafter, said sub-committee undertook several inter-agency meetings and conducted in-depth studies on each type of tax and came up with estimates of potential number of taxpayers and expected revenue vis-\u00e0-vis BIR's collection. It was uncovered that there are loopholes in our tax system that needs to be addressed if the government is indeed serious in generating the much-needed revenues without resorting to borrowing.\n\nOn the Individual Income Tax: 2004 Collection is P95.8 billion whereas the potential collection is estimated at P150 billion.\n\nIt was uncovered that the potential number of tax payers on individual income tax alone is approximately P7.07 Million based on statistical data from NSO, LTO, DOF and Bureau of Local Government Finance, SSS and GSIS. On automatic withholding from compensation earners, the recorded number of employees, wages/salaries of over P5,000 monthly is 5,370,181 while actual number that paid under the substituted filing mechanism is 2,855,500, a difference of 2,514,681. This poses a shortfall in collection amounting to a minimum of P35.0 billion. The BIR nor the DOLE has no list of employers who could have withheld the income tax from their employees but failed to remit the same to the BIR.\n\nOn self-employed individuals. The SSS database showed 5.28 million self-employed members but BIR's self-employed individual taxpayers only reached 433,876 or a mere 8.2% of the potential. If we compare this to the data of the LTO, there are approximately 3,583,000 privately owned cars and trucks registered.\n\nIn 2004, the number of self-employed individuals who filed income tax returns totaled 694,305 and those who actually paid only totaled 291,601 with payments amounting to P4.854B and P7.553B as withholding at source, a total of only P12.40B or 12.29% of tax paid by employee on withholding.\n\nOn the Corporate Income Tax: The 2004 Collection is P131.68 billion wherein the projected CIT would amount to P180 billion.\n\nThe number of corporations registered with SEC is 304,070 while actual number that filed corporate income tax (CIT) is 115,582 or 38% of total number of SEC registrants. The number of companies that actually paid their CIT is 70,434 or 23.16% paid CIT amounting to P131.168 billion.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) should be mandated to furnish the DOF and BIR the lists of corporations by location, primary purpose of business activity, capitalization, and major incorporators in order for the BIR and the DOF to be able to match information submitted to them by companies. Similarly, the net income after tax on each player of industries and corporations should also be given to the BIR. EDISaA\n\nValue Added Tax (VAT) \u2014 the most abused form of tax by taxpayers.\n\nIn 2004 total vatable sales of 161,536 players is P4.039 trillion while the zero-rated sales and exempt sales are P699.094B and P471.209B respectively. These are not included in the output VAT computation. The total VAT collected amounted to only P72.892B or 1.8% of sales whereas the projected VAT is P124.54 billion.\n\nThe government used to collect 3% sales tax on most goods and services, however, this was replaced by a 10% VAT. It is sad to note though that because of certain loopholes in the VAT system coupled with abuses on input VAT deduction and corruption, the VAT revenue collected is very much lower than what could have been collected on the 3% sales tax.\n\nBureau of Internal Revenue\nSummary of Quarterly VAT (2550Q)\nFor Year 2004\n\nThe 1st half of 2005 (excluding Cebu) shows a total sales of P1,511.794B, the zero-rated is P294.051B and exempt sales is P234.72. The tax paid is only P14.739 B or 0.97% less than one percent (1%) of sales. On sales to exempt entities alone VAT deficiency is P47.12 B in 2004 and P23.47B in the 1st half of 2005. IAEcCa\n\nJanuary-June 2005\n\nIn my letter to BIR Commissioner dated Nov. 21, 2005, I questioned why the BIR did not implement Revenue Regulation No. 2-88 Section 4 where the practice to allow VAT registered sellers to automatically deduct their sales to exempt and zero rated in their output VAT declaration is wrong. Similarly, I mentioned that under Revenue Regulation No. 9-89 provision on mixed transaction states that \"when the tax payer is engaged in zero rated and effectively zero rated sales as well as taxable domestic and exempt sales of goods and services and the amount allowable, input tax paid cannot be directly and entirely attributed to anyone in the transactions. It shall be allotted proportionately to each category of transactions. BIR's consent to totally deduct all input VAT to the reduced output VAT is a double whammy to our government. The point that I raised in said letter was met with a deafening silence.\n\nThe telecommunications is now the biggest and most profitable industry. The PLDT, the leading telecoms company, is expected to surpass P30B in net income for CY 2005.\n\nThis industry has a huge potential VAT revenue if the BIR is not remiss in their tax collection effort. In a letter addressed to Her Excellency, Pres. Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo dated January 26, 2006 that was coursed through the Honorable Speaker Jose de Venecia, this Representation conveyed the tax payments of the three largest telecoms players. For PLDT, VAT payments as percentage to sales is quite low. For 1999 it was 1.28%, in 2000 \u2014 0.82%; 2001 \u2014 1.12%; 2002 \u2014 1.64%; 2003 \u2014 1.58%; and 2004 \u2014 2.54%.\n\nFor Globe telecoms, their VAT payments as percentage of their sales is as follows: 1999 \u2014 negative 3.43%, 2000 \u2014 negative 9.29%; 2001 \u2014 negative 7.60%; 2002 \u2014 negative 3.57%; 2003 \u2014 negative 0.01% and 2004 \u2014 positive 0.44%.\n\nFor Globe in 2004 exempt sales is P419.1 M or 0.98% while sales to zero-rated entities is P3.105 B or 7.28%. A total of P3.524 B or 8.26% considered non-vatable.\n\nFor Smart telecoms, their VAT payments as percentage to their sales is as follows: 1999 \u2014 0.69%, 2000 \u2014 negative 0.68%; 2001 \u2014 positive 2.26%; 2002 \u2014 positive 0.53%; 2003 \u2014 positive 0.48% and 2004 \u2014 negative 0.56%.\n\nIn 2004, Smart's alleged sale to exempt entities is P6.734B or 8.2% to zero-rated entities P15.565B or 19.33% a total of P22.599 or 27.53% considered non-vatable. AIaSTE\n\nHistory on VAT payment of the Three (3) Major Telecom's Companies:\n\nIt is apparent that from 1999-2001 Smart had no sales to exempt and zero-rated and for Globe only in 2004 that declared exempt and zero-rated sales, why?\n\nWhile consumers pay the whole of 10% VAT, it appears, however, that this is not being remitted to the government. What is far worse is that players do not declare sales to exempt and zero rated as vatable and over declare their input VAT thereby reducing amount of tax, disregarding BIR's Regulation RMC 17-96, Section 4 of RR-2-88 and RR 9-89 with regards to exempt and zero rated sales.\n\nNot only are the players of the telecommunication industry not declaring as output VAT on their sales to exempt and zero rated sellers. They are not paying VAT on the sales of cell cards that companies claim to be the biggest bulk of their sales. The reason given is that the payment of VAT shall be made upon the utilization of the card, contrary to the excise tax that is automatically collected upon withdrawal of the goods from the warehouse. As to why the BIR agreed to said argument is questionable.\n\nThis representation is doubtful whether the projected additional revenue on the expanded VAT from 10% to 12% and the 12% VAT on fuel, power, air and water transport can be realized if the systemic errors in the VAT collection as practiced by the BIR will not be corrected. Firstly, the input VAT on operational vatable goods and services is 12%. Secondly, the input VAT on capital expense of the power, oil, air and water transport industries may not be totally utilized after few years as what happens to the telecommunication players where VAT on capital expense took several years to be utilized.\n\nUndertaking all these proposals to increase tax collection from individual income tax both from the withholding of employees and from self-employed individuals, increase number of corporate taxpayers corresponding increase in corporate income tax (CIT) and increase collection of value added tax based on existing BIR Circular and Regulations on the matter will more than generate revenue enough to achieve a balanced budget. aCTcDS\n\nIf however, our leaders are anxious to have additional revenue to finance important projects and increase food productivity and similarly increase per capita income for our people, we need not impose a tax that is detrimental to progress in productivity health care and to consumers. Instead of VAT on fuel and power which caused so much suffering to our entrepreneurs and consumers as proposed by many sectors of our society \u2014 freedom from debt consumers, party list representatives, civic and religious sectors. This representation proposes the tax on text messaging, not as additional VAT but direct tax on SMS messaging. Data shows that there are approximately 300 million text messages sent through the mobile networks every day. A tax of fifty centavos per text message would generate around P54.75 billion annually. This is more than double the amount of the expected collection from the VAT on petroleum products and electricity. The revenues that could be realized from this can be earmarked for food productivity.\n\nFurther Mr. Speaker, I propose that the BIR vigorously collect VAT from the toll companies. Even if these toll companies are subject to VAT, they are not implementing it for the reason that the Toll Regulatory Board has not issued an order directing toll operators to include the VAT in their toll rates. If collected properly, the VAT from these toll companies could reach as much as P90 million per month since they have an aggregate monthly toll revenue of P900 million.\n\nMr. Speaker, my esteemed colleagues, this Representation has consistently and diligently worked for the country's efficient revenue collection, which is parallel to the recommendations of Moody's. I have spearheaded an inter-agency task force to project potential revenue per type of tax long before my son was appointed as Finance Secretary.\n\nOn matters concerning the term-sharing as Chairman of the Ways & Means Committee, there are a few things that have to be clarified.\n\nBefore our Christmas adjournment, a signature campaign was undertaken among members of the NPC requesting the Speaker to retain Cong. Lapus as Chairman. I was requested by other members of LAKAS to undertake similar signature campaign. I refused for the simple reason that it is not necessary because the Speaker himself has forged a gentleman's agreement.\n\nA vigorous media campaign ensued, attacking this Representation vying for the Chairmanship of the Committee. The issues hurled against me were bordering along the lines of absurdity one of which is my being old, then conflict of interest since my son Gary is the Secretary of Finance. It was published that father and son tandem will not serve the country well.\n\nConflict of interest exists when one of us is known to be corrupt, if one of us has business interests to protect. The House economist, Congressmen Joey Salceda once said \"that if this Representation will be appointed as chairman on the Ways & Means Committee, it would serve as a bonus because the son is the DOF Secretary\". Conflict of interest can happen not only between family members but, as what happened under the Marcos regime, among cronies engaged in corrupt practices.\n\nCongress is now proposing a Parliamentary form of government where the executive and legislative departments will merge hence eventually the Secretary of Finance will serve as the Chairman of Committee on Ways & Means.\n\nNow, on the term sharing of the Chairmanship of the Ways and Means Committee, Mr. Speaker, I want things to be on proper perspective for the record of this august body. When I brought up this matter on the agreed term sharing with the Speaker, he was willing to give me the chairmanship if and when my son Gary gives up his cabinet position as Secretary of Finance. \"I said no way\".\n\nIn Business World column on outlook on RP mixed (dated Feb. 10-11, 2006) states \"In a report Moody's \u2014 already the most pessimistic among the three major credit raters \u2014 said the government must first show \"more progress\" in improving tax collections, pass the 2006 budget, and make assurances that current economic policies will continue before the \"downward pressure\" on the country's credit ratings is relieved\".\n\nHowever the Business World column of February 6, 2006 it was stated that the House Ways & Means Committee has shifted focus to tax compliance. This representation is of the belief that the Speaker and the House Committee on Ways & Means will now be implementing what I have long been advocating these past 3 terms. Tax collection efficiency must be made a priority to promote transparency in tax collection. Deleting the Secrecy and Confidentiality provision in our Tax Code will not just enhance Individual and Corporate Income Tax Collection it will address corruption problems as well. Input VAT and illegal deductions of exempt and zero rated sales on the Output VAT should also be scrutinized. The telecom industry players had experienced enormous gains yet they have huge amounts of questionable sales including outright declaration on vatable sales on cell cards. The over declaration of input vat and their reduced VAT liabilities is draining our government from the much-needed revenues. With respect to the VAT on the sales of these products, it needs to be immediately reconsidered so the consumers and the government are not placed in a disadvantaged position by the players. EcHAaS\n\nWith these premises Mr. Speaker, It is not necessary for me to be Chairman of the Committee on Ways & Means considering that this administration in cooperation with the lower House under your leadership has now decided to impose tax collection efficiency instead of implement new tax that burden our consumers and entrepreneurs. To this end, let me be clear that I have no other interest but to protect the interest of our people mostly the poor consumers and the coffers of our government.\n\nThank you.",

NORMA L. LIPANA\nOIC, Deputy Commissioner\nResource Management Group\n\nATTACHMENT\n\nOctober 28, 2005\n\nCESB CIRCULAR NO. 006-05\n\nPursuant to CESB Resolution No. 593 dated July 12, 2005, the Board adopts a policy providing for the strict implementation of the Board policies on prescriptive periods and strict adherence to deadlines on submission of required documents.\n\nThe Board, through CESB Resolution No. 459 series of 2002 dated October 8, 2002, issued the Revised Rules on the Career Executive Service (CES) eligibility adopting a four-stage CES eligibility examination process consisting of the 1) Management Aptitude Test Battery (MATB); 2) Assessment Center (AC); 3) Board Interview and 4) Performance Validation on-the-job. The same resolution provides for prescriptive periods on the MATB, Assessment Center, Completion of the CES eligibility examination process and deadlines in the submission of documentary requirements in the Board Interview and the Performance Validation stage. Moreover, the Board also issued, among others, CESB Resolution No. 485 dated June 5, 2003 allowing MATB passers and MNSA and MPSA graduates from 1997 onwards to signify within fifteen (15) days from the date of publication of the said resolution in the Official Gazette, Public Manager and/or paper of national circulation their intention in writing to proceed to the next stage, which is the Assessment Center, otherwise, they shall be deemed to have abandoned the same. AcTHCE\n\nIn the implementation of the above-cited policy resolutions, the Board on several occasions sent ultimatum letters to applicants due to non-compliance with the prescriptive period, non-submission of the required documents and lack of interest to pursue the CES eligibility examination process. A substantial number of applicants despite due notification through ultimatum letters sent to them failed to comply with the prescribed requirements and, therefore, were not allowed to proceed with the examination process. As a matter of fact, they were de-listed from the roster of applicants.\n\nThe Board, however, observed that after it has de-listed a number of applicants from the CES eligibility examination process due to the above-cited reasons, it continued to receive request for reconsiderations from de-listed applicants.\n\nHence, the Board decided to strictly implement its policies on prescriptive periods and strictly adhere to the deadlines in the submission of the required documents prescribed by the Board through its various policy resolutions.\n\nThe request for reconsideration of applicants, who failed to comply with the policies of the Board on prescriptive period and/or failed to adhere to the deadlines prescribed for the submission of the required documents, shall be outrightly denied by the Board through the CESB Secretariat except under highly exceptional circumstances.\n\nThe existence of highly exceptional circumstances may be determined by the concurrence of the following conditions:\n\na) There is proof of interest/initiative on the part of the applicant to pursue his/her CES eligibility; and,\n\nb) Failure to comply with the policies of the Board on prescriptive period and/or failure to adhere to the deadlines in the submission of the required documents is not due to the fault of the applicant.

There is hereby established a Judiciary Development Fund, hereinafter referred to as the Fund, for the benefit of the members and personnel of the Judiciary to help ensure and guarantee the independence of the Judiciary as mandated by the Constitution and public policy and required by the impartial administration of justice. The Fund shall be derived from, among others, the increase in the legal fees prescribed in the amendments to Rule 141 of the Rules of Court to be promulgated by the Supreme Court of the Philippines. The Fund shall be used to augment the allowances of the members and personnel of the Judiciary and to finance the acquisition, maintenance and repair of office equipment and facilities; Provided, That at least eighty percent (80%) of the Fund shall be used for cost of living allowances, and not more than twenty percent (20%) of the said Fund shall be used for office equipment and facilities of the Courts located where the legal fees are collected; Provided, further, That said allowances of the members and personnel of the Judiciary shall be distributed in proportion of their basic salaries; and, Provided, finally, That bigger allowances may be granted to those receiving a basic salary of less than P1,000.00 a month.\" (Emphasis supplied.) SACEca\n\n\"Gross compensation income\" includes all income payments received as a result of an employer-employee relationship, such as salaries, wages, honoraria, bonus, taxable pensions, allowances for transportation, representation, entertainment, fees, fringe benefits, fees and other income of similar nature. Cost of living allowances are not among those listed as non-taxable \"de minimis\" benefits under Revenue Regulations No. 10-2000.\n\nThus, the cost of living allowance distributed to the members and personnel of the Judiciary is considered compensation income subject to income tax and consequently, to the withholding tax on wages prescribed by Section 79 in relation to Section 24 (A) of the Tax Code of 1997.
